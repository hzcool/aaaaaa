    "description": "A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than \"(\" and \")\". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \"+\" and \"1\" into this sequence. For example, \"\", \"(())\" and \"()()\" are regular bracket sequences; \"))\" and \")((\" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and \"(a)\" and \"(1)+(1)\" are not bracket sequences at all.\n\nYou have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $ 2 $ . So, overall you have $ cnt_1 $ strings \"((\", $ cnt_2 $ strings \"()\", $ cnt_3 $ strings \")(\" and $ cnt_4 $ strings \"))\". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $ 2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4) $ . You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.",
