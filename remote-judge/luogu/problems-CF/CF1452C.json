    "hint": "In the first example you can just erase the whole string.\n\nIn the second example you can first erase the brackets on positions $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ : \"\\[\\]()\", then \"()\" is left. After that you can erase it whole. You could erase the whole string from the beginning but you would get one move instead of two.\n\nIn the third example you can first erase the brackets on positions $ 1 $ and $ 3 $ : \"(\\[)\\]\". They form an RBS \"()\". Then \"\\[\\]\" is left, so you can erase it whole.\n\nIn the fourth example there is no subsequence that is an RBS, so you can't perform a move at all.\n\nIn the fifth example you can erase the brackets on positions $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ : \")\\[(\\]\" and get \")(\" as a result. You can erase nothing from it.",
