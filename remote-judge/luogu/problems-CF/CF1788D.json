    "description": "We play a game with $ n $ dots on a number line.\n\nThe initial coordinate of the $ i $ -th dot is $ x_i $ . These coordinates are distinct. Every dot starts moving simultaneously with the same constant speed.\n\nEach dot moves in the direction of the closest dot (different from itself) until it meets another dot. In the case of a tie, it goes to the left. Two dots meet if they are in the same coordinate, after that, they stop moving.\n\nAfter enough time, every dot stops moving. The result of a game is the number of distinct coordinates where the dots stop.\n\nBecause this game is too easy, calculate the sum of results when we play the game for every subset of the given $ n $ dots that has at least two dots. As the result can be very large, print the sum modulo $ 10^9+7 $ .",

    "hint": "In the first example, for a subset of size $ 2 $ , two dots move toward each other, so there is $ 1 $ coordinate where the dots stop.\n\nFor a subset of size $ 3 $ , the first dot and third dot move toward the second dot, so there is $ 1 $ coordinate where the dots stop no matter the direction where the second dot moves.\n\nFor $ [1, 2, 4, 6] $ , the first and second dots move toward each other. For the third dot, initially, the second dot and the fourth dot are the closest dots. Since it is a tie, the third dot moves left. The fourth dot also moves left. So there is $ 1 $ coordinate where the dots stop, which is $ 1.5 $ .\n\nBecause there are $ 6 $ subsets of size $ 2 $ , $ 4 $ subsets of size $ 3 $ and one subset of size $ 4 $ , the answer is $ 6 \\cdot 1 + 4 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 11 $ .\n\nIn the second example, for a subset of size $ 5 $ (when there are dots at $ 1 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 5 $ , $ 11 $ , $ 15 $ ), dots at $ 1 $ and $ 11 $ will move right and dots at $ 3 $ , $ 5 $ , $ 15 $ will move left. Dots at $ 1 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 5 $ will eventually meet at $ 2 $ , and dots at $ 11 $ and $ 15 $ will meet at $ 13 $ , so there are $ 2 $ coordinates where the dots stop.",
