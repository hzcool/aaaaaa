    "description": "For the first time, Polycarp's startup ended the year with a profit! Now he is about to distribute $ k $ burles as a bonus among $ n $ employees.\n\nIt is known that the current salary of the $ i $ -th employee is $ a_i $ and all the values of $ a_i $ in the company are different.\n\nPolycarp wants to distribute the $ k $ burles between $ n $ employees so this month the $ i $ -th employee will be paid not $ a_i $ , but $ a_i+d_i $ ( $ d_i \\ge 0 $ , $ d_i $ is an integer), where $ d_i $ is the bonus for the $ i $ -th employee. Of course, $ d_1+d_2+\\dots+d_n=k $ .\n\nPolycarp will follow two rules for choosing the values $ d_i $ :\n\n- the relative order of the salaries should not be changed: the employee with originally the highest salary ( $ a_i $ is the maximum) should have the highest total payment after receiving their bonus ( $ a_i+d_i $ is also the maximum), the employee whose salary was originally the second-largest should receive the second-largest total payment after receiving their bonus and so on.\n- to emphasize that annual profit is a group effort, Polycarp wants to minimize the maximum total payment to an employee (i.e minimize the maximum value of $ a_i+d_i $ ).\n\nHelp Polycarp decide the non-negative integer bonuses $ d_i $ such that:\n\n- their sum is $ k $ ,\n- for each employee, the number of those who receive strictly more than them remains unchanged (that is, if you sort employees by $ a_i $ and by $ a_i+d_i $ , you get the same order of employees),\n- all $ a_i + d_i $ are different,\n- the maximum of the values $ a_i+d_i $ is the minimum possible.\n\nHelp Polycarp and print any of the possible answers $ d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 10^5 $ , $ 1 \\le k \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the number of employees and the total bonus.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ different integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ), where $ a_i $ is the current salary of the $ i $ -th employee.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all $ n $ values in the input does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Print the answers to $ t $ test cases in the order they appear in the input. Print each answer as a sequence of non-negative integers $ d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n $ . If there are several answers, print any of them.",
