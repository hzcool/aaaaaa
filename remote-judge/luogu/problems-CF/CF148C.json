    "description": "\u00abNext please\u00bb, \u2014 the princess called and cast an estimating glance at the next groom.\n\nThe princess intends to choose the most worthy groom, this is, the richest one. Whenever she sees a groom who is more rich than each of the previous ones, she says a measured \u00abOh...\u00bb. Whenever the groom is richer than all previous ones added together, she exclaims \u00abWow!\u00bb (no \u00abOh...\u00bb in this case). At the sight of the first groom the princess stays calm and says nothing.\n\nThe fortune of each groom is described with an integer between 1 and 50000. You know that during the day the princess saw $ n $ grooms, said \u00abOh...\u00bb exactly $ a $ times and exclaimed \u00abWow!\u00bb exactly $ b $ times. Your task is to output a sequence of $ n $ integers $ t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n} $ , where $ t_{i} $ describes the fortune of $ i $ -th groom. If several sequences are possible, output any of them. If no sequence exists that would satisfy all the requirements, output a single number -1.",
