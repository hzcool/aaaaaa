    "description": "Ivan is reading a book about tournaments. He knows that a tournament is an oriented graph with exactly one oriented edge between each pair of vertices. The score of a vertex is the number of edges going outside this vertex.\n\nYesterday Ivan learned Landau's criterion: there is tournament with scores $ d_{1}<=d_{2}<=...<=d_{n} $ if and only if ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF850D/4fe680476592e82ee231e53c258b2a4afe965574.png) for all $ 1<=k&lt;n $ and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF850D/b56c7605c03639fe817d86958ff45e5e76f9d556.png).\n\nNow, Ivan wanna solve following problem: given a set of numbers $ S={a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{m}} $ , is there a tournament with given set of scores? I.e. is there tournament with sequence of scores $ d_{1},d_{2},...,d_{n} $ such that if we remove duplicates in scores, we obtain the required set $ {a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{m}} $ ?\n\nFind a tournament with minimum possible number of vertices.",

    "outputFormat": "If there are no such tournaments, print string \"=(\" (without quotes).\n\nOtherwise, print an integer $ n $ \u2014 the number of vertices in the tournament.\n\nThen print $ n $ lines with $ n $ characters \u2014 matrix of the tournament. The $ j $ -th element in the $ i $ -th row should be $ 1 $ if the edge between the $ i $ -th and the $ j $ -th vertices is oriented towards the $ j $ -th vertex, and $ 0 $ otherwise. The main diagonal should contain only zeros.",
