    "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game. There are $ n $ cells in a row. Initially each cell is either red or blue. Alice goes first.\n\nOn each turn, Alice chooses two neighbouring cells which contain at least one red cell, and paints that two cells white. Then, Bob chooses two neighbouring cells which contain at least one blue cell, and paints that two cells white. The player who cannot make a move loses.\n\nFind the winner if both Alice and Bob play optimally.\n\nNote that a chosen cell can be white, as long as the other cell satisfies the constraints.",

Description of test cases follows.\n\nFor each test case, the first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of cells.\n\nThe second line contains a string $ s $ of length $ n $ \u2014 the initial state of the cells. The $ i $ -th cell is red if $ s_i =  $ R, blue if $ s_i =  $ B.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 5 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",

    "hint": "In the notes, the cell numbers increase from left to right.\n\nIn the first testcase for Alice, she has two choices: paint the first and the second cells, or paint the second and the third cells. No matter what choice Alice makes, there will be exactly one blue cell after Alice's move. Bob just needs to paint the blue cell and its neighbour, then every cell will be white and Alice can't make a move. So Bob is the winner.\n\nIn the second testcase no matter what Alice chooses, Bob can choose to paint the fourth and fifth cells in $ 2 $ turns.\n\nIn the third testcase at first, Alice paints the third and the fourth cells. It doesn't matter if Bob paints the first and the second cells or the fifth and sixth cells, as Alice can paint the other two cells.\n\nIn the fourth testcase at first, Alice paints the second and the third cells. If Bob paints the fifth and the sixth cells or the fourth and the fifth cells, then Alice paints the seventh and the eighth cells. If Bob paints the seventh and the eighth cells, then Alice paints the fifth and the sixth cells.\n\nIn the fifth Alice chooses the middle two cells at first, then Bob obviously has only two options, whichever variant he chooses, Alice can choose the other one and win.\n\nIn the eighth no matter what Alice chooses, Bob can choose the other two symmetrical cells.",
