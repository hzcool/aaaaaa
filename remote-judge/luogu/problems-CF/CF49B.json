    "description": "Vasya studies positional numeral systems. Unfortunately, he often forgets to write the base of notation in which the expression is written. Once he saw a note in his notebook saying $ a+b=? $ , and that the base of the positional notation wasn\u2019t written anywhere. Now Vasya has to choose a base $ p $ and regard the expression as written in the base $ p $ positional notation. Vasya understood that he can get different results with different bases, and some bases are even invalid. For example, expression $ 78+87 $ in the base 16 positional notation is equal to $ FF_{16} $ , in the base 15 positional notation it is equal to $ 110_{15} $ , in the base 10 one \u2014 to $ 165_{10} $ , in the base 9 one \u2014 to $ 176_{9} $ , and in the base 8 or lesser-based positional notations the expression is invalid as all the numbers should be strictly less than the positional notation base. Vasya got interested in what is the length of the longest possible expression value. Help him to find this length.\n\nThe length of a number should be understood as the number of numeric characters in it. For example, the length of the longest answer for $ 78+87=? $ is 3. It is calculated like that in the base 15 ( $ 110_{15} $ ), base 10 ( $ 165_{10} $ ), base 9 ( $ 176_{9} $ ) positional notations, for example, and in some other ones.",
