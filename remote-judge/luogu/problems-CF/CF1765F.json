    "description": "Monocarp is planning on opening a chemistry lab. During the first month, he's going to distribute solutions of a certain acid.\n\nFirst, he will sign some contracts with a local chemistry factory. Each contract provides Monocarp with an unlimited supply of some solution of the same acid. The factory provides $ n $ contract options, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The $ i $ -th solution has a concentration of $ x_i\\% $ , the contract costs $ w_i $ burles, and Monocarp will be able to sell it for $ c_i $ burles per liter.\n\nMonocarp is expecting $ k $ customers during the first month. Each customer will buy a liter of a $ y\\% $ -solution, where $ y $ is a real number chosen uniformly at random from $ 0 $ to $ 100 $ independently for each customer. More formally, the probability of number $ y $ being less than or equal to some $ t $ is $ P(y \\le t) = \\frac{t}{100} $ .\n\nMonocarp can mix the solution that he signed the contracts with the factory for, at any ratio. More formally, if he has contracts for $ m $ solutions with concentrations $ x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_m $ , then, for these solutions, he picks their volumes $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_m $ so that $ \\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = 1 $ (exactly $ 1 $ since each customer wants exactly one liter of a certain solution).\n\nThe concentration of the resulting solution is $ \\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{m} x_i \\cdot a_i $ . The price of the resulting solution is $ \\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{m} c_i \\cdot a_i $ .\n\nIf Monocarp can obtain a solution of concentration $ y\\% $ , then he will do it while maximizing its price (the cost for the customer). Otherwise, the customer leaves without buying anything, and the price is considered equal to $ 0 $ .\n\nMonocarp wants to sign some contracts with a factory (possibly, none or all of them) so that the expected profit is maximized \u2014 the expected total price of the sold solutions for all $ k $ customers minus the total cost of signing the contracts from the factory.\n\nPrint the maximum expected profit Monocarp can achieve.",
