You are to represent $ n_{i} $ as a sum of maximum possible number of composite summands and print this maximum number, or print -1, if there are no such splittings.\n\nAn integer greater than $ 1 $ is composite, if it is not prime, i.e. if it has positive divisors not equal to $ 1 $ and the integer itself.",
