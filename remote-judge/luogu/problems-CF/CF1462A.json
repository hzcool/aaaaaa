He wrote it out on the whiteboard as follows:\n\n- he wrote the number $ a_1 $ to the left side (at the beginning of the whiteboard);\n- he wrote the number $ a_2 $ to the right side (at the end of the whiteboard);\n- then as far to the left as possible (but to the right from $ a_1 $ ), he wrote the number $ a_3 $ ;\n- then as far to the right as possible (but to the left from $ a_2 $ ), he wrote the number $ a_4 $ ;\n- Polycarp continued to act as well, until he wrote out the entire sequence on the whiteboard.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1462A/7e19e012703d1d50cdf1aa56b8379b549d74c5c4.png)The beginning of the result looks like this (of course, if $ n \\ge 4 $ ).For example, if $ n=7 $ and $ a=[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2] $ , then Polycarp will write a sequence on the whiteboard $ [3, 4, 5, 2, 9, 1, 1] $ .\n\nYou saw the sequence written on the whiteboard and now you want to restore Polycarp's favorite sequence.",
