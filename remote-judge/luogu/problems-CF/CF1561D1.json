    "description": "This version of the problem differs from the next one only in the constraint on $ n $ .\n\nNote that the memory limit in this problem is lower than in others.\n\nYou have a vertical strip with $ n $ cells, numbered consecutively from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from top to bottom.\n\nYou also have a token that is initially placed in cell $ n $ . You will move the token up until it arrives at cell $ 1 $ .\n\nLet the token be in cell $ x > 1 $ at some moment. One shift of the token can have either of the following kinds:\n\n- Subtraction: you choose an integer $ y $ between $ 1 $ and $ x-1 $ , inclusive, and move the token from cell $ x $ to cell $ x - y $ .\n- Floored division: you choose an integer $ z $ between $ 2 $ and $ x $ , inclusive, and move the token from cell $ x $ to cell $ \\lfloor \\frac{x}{z} \\rfloor $ ( $ x $ divided by $ z $ rounded down).\n\nFind the number of ways to move the token from cell $ n $ to cell $ 1 $ using one or more shifts, and print it modulo $ m $ . Note that if there are several ways to move the token from one cell to another in one shift, all these ways are considered distinct (check example explanation for a better understanding).",

    "hint": "In the first test, there are three ways to move the token from cell $ 3 $ to cell $ 1 $ in one shift: using subtraction of $ y = 2 $ , or using division by $ z = 2 $ or $ z = 3 $ .\n\nThere are also two ways to move the token from cell $ 3 $ to cell $ 1 $ via cell $ 2 $ : first subtract $ y = 1 $ , and then either subtract $ y = 1 $ again or divide by $ z = 2 $ .\n\nTherefore, there are five ways in total.",
