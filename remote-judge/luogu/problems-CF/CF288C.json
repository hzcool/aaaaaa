But most of all he likes permutations of integers from $ 0 $ to $ n $ , inclusive.\n\nFor permutation $ p=p_{0},p_{1},...,p_{n} $ , Polo has defined its beauty \u2014 number ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF288C/6024047c9c91de0156ffb9e5c8b6ac649d55fe1e.png).\n\nExpression ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF288C/a0b0fe9e9428287337c0277ea02ca07fcf0a01a7.png) means applying the operation of bitwise excluding \"OR\" to numbers $ x $ and $ y $ . This operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, in language C++ and Java it is represented as \"^\" and in Pascal \u2014 as \"xor\".\n\nHelp him find among all permutations of integers from $ 0 $ to $ n $ the permutation with the maximum beauty.",
