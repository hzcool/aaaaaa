    "description": "It has been noted that if some ants are put in the junctions of the graphene integer lattice then they will act in the following fashion: every minute at each junction ( $ x $ , $ y $ ) containing at least four ants a group of four ants will be formed, and these four ants will scatter to the neighbouring junctions ( $ x+1 $ , $ y $ ), ( $ x-1 $ , $ y $ ), ( $ x $ , $ y+1 $ ), ( $ x $ , $ y-1 $ ) \u2014 one ant in each direction. No other ant movements will happen. Ants never interfere with each other.\n\nScientists have put a colony of $ n $ ants into the junction (0, 0) and now they wish to know how many ants will there be at some given junctions, when the movement of the ants stops.",
    "inputFormat": "First input line contains integers $ n $ ( $ 0<=n<=30000 $ ) and $ t $ ( $ 1<=t<=50000 $ ), where $ n $ is the number of ants in the colony and $ t $ is the number of queries. Each of the next $ t $ lines contains coordinates of a query junction: integers $ x_{i} $ , $ y_{i} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=x_{i},y_{i}<=10^{9} $ ). Queries may coincide.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there will be a certain moment of time when no possible movements can happen (in other words, the process will eventually end).",
    "outputFormat": "Print $ t $ integers, one per line \u2014 the number of ants at the corresponding junctions when the movement of the ants stops.",

    "hint": "In the first sample the colony consists of the one ant, so nothing happens at all.\n\nIn the second sample the colony consists of 6 ants. At the first minute 4 ants scatter from (0, 0) to the neighbouring junctions. After that the process stops.",
