    "description": "Hemose was shopping with his friends Samez, AhmedZ, AshrafEzz, TheSawan and O\\_E in Germany. As you know, Hemose and his friends are problem solvers, so they are very clever. Therefore, they will go to all discount markets in Germany.\n\nHemose has an array of $ n $ integers. He wants Samez to sort the array in the non-decreasing order. Since it would be a too easy problem for Samez, Hemose allows Samez to use only the following operation:\n\n- Choose indices $ i $ and $ j $ such that $ 1 \\le i, j \\le n $ , and $ \\lvert i - j \\rvert \\geq x $ . Then, swap elements $ a_i $ and $ a_j $ .\n\nCan you tell Samez if there's a way to sort the array in the non-decreasing order by using the operation written above some finite number of times (possibly $ 0 $ )?",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ $ (1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5) $ . Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ x $ $ (1 \\leq x \\leq n \\leq 10^5) $ .\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, ..., a_n $ $ (1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9) $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases doesn't exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, you should output a single string.\n\nIf Samez can sort the array in non-decreasing order using the operation written above, output \"YES\" (without quotes). Otherwise, output \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\nYou can print each letter of \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (upper or lower).",
