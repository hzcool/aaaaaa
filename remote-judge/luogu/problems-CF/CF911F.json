    "description": "You are given an unweighted tree with $ n $ vertices. Then $ n-1 $ following operations are applied to the tree. A single operation consists of the following steps:\n\n1. choose two leaves;\n2. add the length of the simple path between them to the answer;\n3. remove one of the chosen leaves from the tree.\n\nInitial answer (before applying operations) is $ 0 $ . Obviously after $ n-1 $ such operations the tree will consist of a single vertex.\n\nCalculate the maximal possible answer you can achieve, and construct a sequence of operations that allows you to achieve this answer!",
