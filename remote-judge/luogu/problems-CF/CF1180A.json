    "description": "While playing with geometric figures Alex has accidentally invented a concept of a  $ n $ -th order rhombus in a cell grid.\n\nA $ 1 $ -st order rhombus is just a square $ 1 \\times 1 $ (i.e just a cell).\n\nA $ n $ -th order rhombus for all $ n \\geq 2 $ one obtains from a  $ n-1 $ -th order rhombus adding all cells which have a common side with it to it (look at the picture to understand it better).\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1180A/ccf29660dcd8bd16597fff06e6153caa2bd347a9.png)Alex asks you to compute the number of cells in a  $ n $ -th order rhombus.",
