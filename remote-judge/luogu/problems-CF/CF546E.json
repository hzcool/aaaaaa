Now soldiers roam. After roaming each soldier has to either stay in his city or to go to the one of neighboring cities by at moving along at most one road.\n\nCheck if is it possible that after roaming there will be exactly $ b_{i} $ soldiers in the $ i $ -th city.",
    "inputFormat": "First line of input consists of two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ , $ 0<=m<=200 $ ).\n\nNext line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=100 $ ).\n\nNext line contains $ n $ integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ ( $ 0<=b_{i}<=100 $ ).\n\nThen $ m $ lines follow, each of them consists of two integers $ p $ and $ q $ ( $ 1<=p,q<=n $ , $ p\u2260q $ ) denoting that there is an undirected road between cities $ p $ and $ q $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at most one road between each pair of cities.",
