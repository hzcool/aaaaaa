    "description": "Two friends, Alisa and Yuki, planted a tree with $ n $ vertices in their garden. A tree is an undirected graph without cycles, loops, or multiple edges. Each edge in this tree has a length of $ k $ . Initially, vertex $ 1 $ is the root of the tree.\n\nAlisa and Yuki are growing the tree not just for fun, they want to sell it. The cost of the tree is defined as the maximum distance from the root to a vertex among all vertices of the tree. The distance between two vertices $ u $ and $ v $ is the sum of the lengths of the edges on the path from $ u $ to $ v $ .\n\nThe girls took a course in gardening, so they know how to modify the tree. Alisa and Yuki can spend $ c $ coins to shift the root of the tree to one of the neighbors of the current root. This operation can be performed any number of times (possibly zero). Note that the structure of the tree is left unchanged; the only change is which vertex is the root.\n\nThe friends want to sell the tree with the maximum profit. The profit is defined as the difference between the cost of the tree and the total cost of operations. The profit is cost of the tree minus the total cost of operations.\n\nHelp the girls and find the maximum profit they can get by applying operations to the tree any number of times (possibly zero).",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains integers $ n $ , $ k $ , $ c $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ; $ 1 \\le k, c \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree, the length of each edge, and the cost of the operation.\n\nThe next $ n - 1 $ lines of the test case contain pairs of integers $ u_i $ , $ v_i $ ( $ 1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n $ ) \u2014 the edges of the graph. These edges form a tree.\n\nThe sum of the values of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
