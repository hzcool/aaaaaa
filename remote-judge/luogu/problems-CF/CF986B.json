    "description": "Petr likes to come up with problems about randomly generated data. This time problem is about random permutation. He decided to generate a random permutation this way: he takes identity permutation of numbers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ and then $ 3n $ times takes a random pair of different elements and swaps them. Alex envies Petr and tries to imitate him in all kind of things. Alex has also come up with a problem about random permutation. He generates a random permutation just like Petr but swaps elements $ 7n+1 $ times instead of $ 3n $ times. Because it is more random, OK?!\n\nYou somehow get a test from one of these problems and now you want to know from which one.",
    "inputFormat": "In the first line of input there is one integer $ n $ ( $ 10^{3} \\le n \\le 10^{6} $ ).\n\nIn the second line there are $ n $ distinct integers between $ 1 $ and $ n $ \u2014 the permutation of size $ n $ from the test.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all tests except for sample are generated this way: First we choose $ n $ \u2014 the size of the permutation. Then we randomly choose a method to generate a permutation \u2014 the one of Petr or the one of Alex. Then we generate a permutation using chosen method.",
    "outputFormat": "If the test is generated via Petr's method print \"Petr\" (without quotes). If the test is generated via Alex's method print \"Um\\_nik\" (without quotes).",
    "samples": [
        [
            "5\n2 4 5 1 3\n",
            "Petr\n"
        ]
    ],
    "hint": "Please note that the sample is not a valid test (because of limitations for $ n $ ) and is given only to illustrate input/output format. Your program still has to print correct answer to this test to get AC.\n\nDue to randomness of input hacks in this problem are forbidden.",
