    "description": "Iahub and Iahubina went to a date at a luxury restaurant. Everything went fine until paying for the food. Instead of money, the waiter wants Iahub to write a Hungry sequence consisting of $ n $ integers.\n\nA sequence $ a_{1} $ , $ a_{2} $ , ..., $ a_{n} $ , consisting of $ n $ integers, is Hungry if and only if:\n\n- Its elements are in increasing order. That is an inequality $ a_{i}&lt;a_{j} $ holds for any two indices $ i,j $ $ (i&lt;j) $ .\n- For any two indices $ i $ and $ j $ $ (i&lt;j) $ , $ a_{j} $ must not be divisible by $ a_{i} $ .\n\nIahub is in trouble, so he asks you for help. Find a Hungry sequence with $ n $ elements.",
