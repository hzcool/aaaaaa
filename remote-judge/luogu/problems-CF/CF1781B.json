    "description": "A company of $ n $ people is planning a visit to the cinema. Every person can either go to the cinema or not. That depends on how many other people will go. Specifically, every person $ i $ said: \"I want to go to the cinema if and only if at least $ a_i $ other people will go, not counting myself\". That means that person $ i $ will become sad if:\n\n- they go to the cinema, and strictly less than $ a_i $ other people go; or\n- they don't go to the cinema, and at least $ a_i $ other people go.\n\nIn how many ways can a set of people going to the cinema be chosen so that nobody becomes sad?",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of people in the company.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \\le a_i \\le n - 1 $ ) \u2014 integers from peoples' claims.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
