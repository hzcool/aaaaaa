    "description": "Amr loves Geometry. One day he came up with a very interesting problem.\n\nAmr has a circle of radius $ r $ and center in point $ (x,y) $ . He wants the circle center to be in new position $ (x',y') $ .\n\nIn one step Amr can put a pin to the border of the circle in a certain point, then rotate the circle around that pin by any angle and finally remove the pin.\n\nHelp Amr to achieve his goal in minimum number of steps.",
    "inputFormat": "Input consists of 5 space-separated integers $ r $ , $ x $ , $ y $ , $ x' $ $ y' $ ( $ 1<=r<=10^{5} $ , $ -10^{5}<=x,y,x',y'<=10^{5} $ ), circle radius, coordinates of original center of the circle and coordinates of destination center of the circle respectively.",
    "outputFormat": "Output a single integer \u2014 minimum number of steps required to move the center of the circle to the destination point.",
