    "description": "Mishka received a gift of multicolored pencils for his birthday! Unfortunately he lives in a monochrome world, where everything is of the same color and only saturation differs. This pack can be represented as a sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ of $ n $ integer numbers \u2014 saturation of the color of each pencil. Now Mishka wants to put all the mess in the pack in order. He has an infinite number of empty boxes to do this. He would like to fill some boxes in such a way that:\n\n- Each pencil belongs to exactly one box;\n- Each non-empty box has at least $ k $ pencils in it;\n- If pencils $ i $ and $ j $ belong to the same box, then $ |a_{i}-a_{j}|<=d $ , where $ |x| $ means absolute value of $ x $ . Note that the opposite is optional, there can be pencils $ i $ and $ j $ such that $ |a_{i}-a_{j}|<=d $ and they belong to different boxes.\n\nHelp Mishka to determine if it's possible to distribute all the pencils into boxes. Print \"YES\" if there exists such a distribution. Otherwise print \"NO\".",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integer numbers $ n $ , $ k $ and $ d $ ( $ 1<=k<=n<=5\u00b710^{5} $ , $ 0<=d<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the number of pencils, minimal size of any non-empty box and maximal difference in saturation between any pair of pencils in the same box, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integer numbers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 saturation of color of each pencil.",

And you also can put all the pencils into the same box, difference of any pair in it won't exceed $ 10 $ .\n\nIn the second example you can split pencils of saturations $ [4,5,3,4] $ into $ 2 $ boxes of size $ 2 $ and put the remaining ones into another box.",
