    "description": "Inaka has a disc, the circumference of which is $ n $ units. The circumference is equally divided by $ n $ points numbered clockwise from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , such that points $ i $ and $ i + 1 $ ( $ 1 \\leq i < n $ ) are adjacent, and so are points $ n $ and $ 1 $ .\n\nThere are $ m $ straight segments on the disc, the endpoints of which are all among the aforementioned $ n $ points.\n\nInaka wants to know if her image is rotationally symmetrical, i.e. if there is an integer $ k $ ( $ 1 \\leq k < n $ ), such that if all segments are rotated clockwise around the center of the circle by $ k $ units, the new image will be the same as the original one.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 100\\,000 $ , $ 1 \\leq m \\leq 200\\,000 $ ) \u2014 the number of points and the number of segments, respectively.\n\nThe $ i $ -th of the following $ m $ lines contains two space-separated integers $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ ( $ 1 \\leq a_i, b_i \\leq n $ , $ a_i \\neq b_i $ ) that describe a segment connecting points $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that no segments coincide.",
