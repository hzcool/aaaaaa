    "description": "Mihai has an $ 8 \\times 8 $ chessboard whose rows are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ 8 $ from top to bottom and whose columns are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ 8 $ from left to right.\n\nMihai has placed exactly one bishop on the chessboard. The bishop is not placed on the edges of the board. (In other words, the row and column of the bishop are between $ 2 $ and $ 7 $ , inclusive.)\n\nThe bishop attacks in all directions diagonally, and there is no limit to the distance which the bishop can attack. Note that the cell on which the bishop is placed is also considered attacked.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1692C/a628ab5b17df485b146f85dc0b0977dd4288932f.png)An example of a bishop on a chessboard. The squares it attacks are marked in red.Mihai has marked all squares the bishop attacks, but forgot where the bishop was! Help Mihai find the position of the bishop.",

There is an empty line before each test case.\n\nEach test case consists of $ 8 $ lines, each containing $ 8 $ characters.
