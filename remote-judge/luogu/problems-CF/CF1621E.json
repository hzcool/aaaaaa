    "description": "You have decided to open a new school. You have already found $ n $ teachers and $ m $ groups of students. The $ i $ -th group of students consists of $ k_i \\geq 2 $ students. You know age of each teacher and each student. The ages of teachers are $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ and the ages of students of the $ i $ -th group are $ b_{i, 1}, b_{i, 2}, \\ldots, b_{i, k_i} $ .\n\nTo start lessons you should assign the teacher to each group of students. Such assignment should satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- To each group exactly one teacher assigned.\n- To each teacher at most $ 1 $ group of students assigned.\n- The average of students' ages in each group doesn't exceed the age of the teacher assigned to this group.\n\nThe average of set $ x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k $ of $ k $ integers is $ \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_k}{k} $ .\n\nRecently you have heard that one of the students will refuse to study in your school. After this, the size of one group will decrease by $ 1 $ while all other groups will remain unchanged.\n\nYou don't know who will refuse to study. For each student determine if you can start lessons in case of his refusal.\n\nNote, that it is not guaranteed that it is possible to start lessons before any refusal.",

Thus, students of the $ 1 $ -st group are numbered by integers $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , $ \\ldots $ , $ k_1 $ , students of the $ 2 $ -nd group are numbered by integers $ k_1 + 1 $ , $ k_1 + 2 $ , $ \\ldots $ , $ k_1 + k_2 $ and so on.",

    "hint": "In the first test case there is one group of students with average age $ \\frac{25+16+37}{3}=26 $ and one teacher with age $ 30 $ . There exists only one assignment that allows to start lessons.\n\nIf the student with age $ 16 $ will refuse to study, the average age of students in this group will become $ \\frac{25+37}{2}=31 $ so there won't be any assignment that allows to start lessons.\n\nIn the second test case it is impossible to start lessons initially. However, if the $ 3 $ -rd student with age $ 111 $ will refuse to study, the average ages of groups will become $ \\frac{4 + 5}{2}=4.5 $ and $ \\frac{11+11}{2} = 11 $ correspondingly. Then it is possible to assing the first group to the first teacher and the second group to the third teacher.",
