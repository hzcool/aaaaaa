    "description": "Recently Luba learned about a special kind of numbers that she calls beautiful numbers. The number is called beautiful iff its binary representation consists of $ k+1 $ consecutive ones, and then $ k $ consecutive zeroes.\n\nSome examples of beautiful numbers:\n\n- $ 1_{2} $ ( $ 1_{10} $ );\n- $ 110_{2} $ ( $ 6_{10} $ );\n- $ 1111000_{2} $ ( $ 120_{10} $ );\n- $ 111110000_{2} $ ( $ 496_{10} $ ).\n\nMore formally, the number is beautiful iff there exists some positive integer $ k $ such that the number is equal to $ (2^{k}-1)*(2^{k-1}) $ .\n\nLuba has got an integer number $ n $ , and she wants to find its greatest beautiful divisor. Help her to find it!",

    "outputFormat": "Output one number \u2014 the greatest beautiful divisor of Luba's number. It is obvious that the answer always exists.",
