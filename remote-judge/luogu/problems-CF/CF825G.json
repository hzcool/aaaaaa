You have to process $ q $ queries of two different types:\n\n1. $ 1 $ $ x $ \u2014 change the color of vertex $ x $ to black. It is guaranteed that the first query will be of this type.\n2. $ 2 $ $ x $ \u2014 for the vertex $ x $ , find the minimum index $ y $ such that the vertex with index $ y $ belongs to the simple path from $ x $ to some black vertex (a simple path never visits any vertex more than once).\n\nFor each query of type $ 2 $ print the answer to it.\n\nNote that the queries are given in modified way.",
