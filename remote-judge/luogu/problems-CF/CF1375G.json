    "description": "You are given a tree with $ n $ vertices. You are allowed to modify the structure of the tree through the following multi-step operation:\n\n1. Choose three vertices $ a $ , $ b $ , and $ c $ such that $ b $ is adjacent to both $ a $ and $ c $ .\n2. For every vertex $ d $ other than $ b $  that is adjacent to $ a $ , remove the edge connecting $ d $ and $ a $ and add the edge connecting $ d $ and $ c $ .\n3. Delete the edge connecting $ a $ and $ b $ and add the edge connecting $ a $ and $ c $ .\n\nAs an example, consider the following tree:\n\n  ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1375G/eafeabf55552a872e419f2e9d6a1d53612765f20.png)The following diagram illustrates the sequence of steps that happen when we apply an operation to vertices $ 2 $ , $ 4 $ , and $ 5 $ :\n\n  ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1375G/c824e4b3dc28492ea8b0c323d7e50d614cefde05.png)It can be proven that after each operation, the resulting graph is still a tree.\n\nFind the minimum number of operations that must be performed to transform the tree into a star. A star is a tree with one vertex of degree $ n - 1 $ , called its center, and $ n - 1 $ vertices of degree $ 1 $ .",

It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.",
