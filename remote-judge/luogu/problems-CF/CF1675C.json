    "description": "Polycarp bought a new expensive painting and decided to show it to his $ n $ friends. He hung it in his room. $ n $ of his friends entered and exited there one by one. At one moment there was no more than one person in the room. In other words, the first friend entered and left first, then the second, and so on.\n\nIt is known that at the beginning (before visiting friends) a picture hung in the room. At the end (after the $ n $ -th friend) it turned out that it disappeared. At what exact moment it disappeared \u2014 there is no information.\n\nPolycarp asked his friends one by one. He asked each one if there was a picture when he entered the room. Each friend answered one of three:\n\n- no (response encoded with 0);\n- yes (response encoded as 1);\n- can't remember (response is encoded with ?).\n\nEveryone except the thief either doesn't remember or told the truth. The thief can say anything (any of the three options).\n\nPolycarp cannot understand who the thief is. He asks you to find out the number of those who can be considered a thief according to the answers.",

Each character in the string is either 0 or 1 or ?.\n\nThe given regularity is described in the actual situation. In particular, on the basis of answers, at least one friend can be suspected of stealing a painting.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of string lengths over the entire input data set does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",

It can be shown that no one else could be the thief.\n\nIn the fourth case, we know absolutely nothing, so we suspect everyone.",
