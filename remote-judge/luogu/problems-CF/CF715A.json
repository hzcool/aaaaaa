There is a number displayed on the screen and there are two buttons, ' $ + $ ' (plus) and '![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF715A/59438ac362049a52a19e6e78713de751c1d0a324.png)' (square root). Initially, the number $ 2 $ is displayed on the screen. There are $ n+1 $ levels in the game and ZS the Coder start at the level $ 1 $ .\n\nWhen ZS the Coder is at level $ k $ , he can :\n\n1. Press the ' $ + $ ' button. This increases the number on the screen by exactly $ k $ . So, if the number on the screen was $ x $ , it becomes $ x+k $ .\n2. Press the '![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF715A/59438ac362049a52a19e6e78713de751c1d0a324.png)' button. Let the number on the screen be $ x $ . After pressing this button, the number becomes ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF715A/e2db36dd56c863e7b06dd83afaf9d635a860d586.png). After that, ZS the Coder levels up, so his current level becomes $ k+1 $ . This button can only be pressed when $ x $ is a perfect square, i.e. $ x=m^{2} $ for some positive integer $ m $ .\n\nAdditionally, after each move, if ZS the Coder is at level $ k $ , and the number on the screen is $ m $ , then  $ m $ must be a multiple of $ k $ . Note that this condition is only checked after performing the press. For example, if ZS the Coder is at level $ 4 $ and current number is $ 100 $ , he presses the '![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF715A/59438ac362049a52a19e6e78713de751c1d0a324.png)' button and the number turns into $ 10 $ . Note that at this moment, $ 10 $ is not divisible by $ 4 $ , but this press is still valid, because after it, ZS the Coder is at level $ 5 $ , and $ 10 $ is divisible by $ 5 $ .\n\nZS the Coder needs your help in beating the game \u2014 he wants to reach level $ n+1 $ . In other words, he needs to press the '![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF715A/59438ac362049a52a19e6e78713de751c1d0a324.png)' button $ n $ times. Help him determine the number of times he should press the ' $ + $ ' button before pressing the '![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF715A/59438ac362049a52a19e6e78713de751c1d0a324.png)' button at each level.\n\nPlease note that ZS the Coder wants to find just any sequence of presses allowing him to reach level $ n+1 $ , but not necessarily a sequence minimizing the number of presses.",
