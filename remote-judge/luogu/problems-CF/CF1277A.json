    "description": "Hooray! Polycarp turned $ n $ years old! The Technocup Team sincerely congratulates Polycarp!\n\nPolycarp celebrated all of his $ n $ birthdays: from the $ 1 $ -th to the $ n $ -th. At the moment, he is wondering: how many times he turned beautiful number of years?\n\nAccording to Polycarp, a positive integer is beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more times. For example, the following numbers are beautiful: $ 1 $ , $ 77 $ , $ 777 $ , $ 44 $ and $ 999999 $ . The following numbers are not beautiful: $ 12 $ , $ 11110 $ , $ 6969 $ and $ 987654321 $ .\n\nOf course, Polycarpus uses the decimal numeral system (i.e. radix is 10).\n\nHelp Polycarpus to find the number of numbers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ (inclusive) that are beautiful.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case consists of one line, which contains a positive integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 how many years Polycarp has turned.",
    "outputFormat": "Print $ t $ integers \u2014 the answers to the given test cases in the order they are written in the test. Each answer is an integer: the number of beautiful years between $ 1 $ and $ n $ , inclusive.",
