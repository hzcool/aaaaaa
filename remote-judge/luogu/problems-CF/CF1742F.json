    "description": "Alperen has two strings, $ s $ and $ t $ which are both initially equal to \"a\".\n\nHe will perform $ q $ operations of two types on the given strings:\n\n- $ 1 \\;\\; k \\;\\; x $ \u2014 Append the string $ x $ exactly $ k $ times at the end of string $ s $ . In other words, $ s := s + \\underbrace{x + \\dots + x}_{k \\text{ times}} $ .\n- $ 2 \\;\\; k \\;\\; x $ \u2014 Append the string $ x $ exactly $ k $ times at the end of string $ t $ . In other words, $ t := t + \\underbrace{x + \\dots + x}_{k \\text{ times}} $ .\n\nAfter each operation, determine if it is possible to rearrange the characters of $ s $ and $ t $ such that $ s $ is lexicographically smaller $ ^{\\dagger} $ than $ t $ .\n\nNote that the strings change after performing each operation and don't go back to their initial states.\n\n $ ^{\\dagger} $ Simply speaking, the lexicographical order is the order in which words are listed in a dictionary. A formal definition is as follows: string $ p $ is lexicographically smaller than string $ q $ if there exists a position $ i $ such that $ p_i < q_i $ , and for all $ j < i $ , $ p_j = q_j $ . If no such $ i $ exists, then $ p $ is lexicographically smaller than $ q $ if the length of $ p $ is less than the length of $ q $ . For example, $ \\texttt{abdc} < \\texttt{abe} $ and $ \\texttt{abc} < \\texttt{abcd} $ , where we write $ p < q $ if $ p $ is lexicographically smaller than $ q $ .",

Since \"a\" is already lexicographically smaller than \"aaa\", the answer for this operation should be \"YES\".\n\nAfter the second operation string $ s $ becomes \"aaa\", and since $ t $ is also equal to \"aaa\", we can't arrange $ s $ in any way such that it is lexicographically smaller than $ t $ , so the answer is \"NO\".\n\nAfter the third operation string $ t $ becomes \"aaaaaa\" and $ s $ is already lexicographically smaller than it so the answer is \"YES\".\n\nAfter the fourth operation $ s $ becomes \"aaabb\" and there is no way to make it lexicographically smaller than \"aaaaaa\" so the answer is \"NO\".\n\nAfter the fifth operation the string $ t $ becomes \"aaaaaaabcaabcaabca\", and we can rearrange the strings to: \"bbaaa\" and \"caaaaaabcaabcaabaa\" so that $ s $ is lexicographically smaller than $ t $ , so we should answer \"YES\".",
