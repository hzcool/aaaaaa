You should divide all segments into two non-empty groups in such way that there is no pair of segments from different groups which have at least one common point, or say that it's impossible to do it. Each segment should belong to exactly one group.\n\nTo optimize testing process you will be given multitest.",

It is guaranteed that $ \\sum{n} $ over all queries does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .\n\nThe next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ l_i $ , $ r_i $ per line ( $ 1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the $ i $ -th segment.",
