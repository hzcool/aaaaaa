    "description": "Maxim loves sequences, especially those that strictly increase. He is wondering, what is the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the given sequence $ a $ ?\n\nSequence $ a $ is given as follows:\n\n- the length of the sequence equals $ n\u00d7t $ ;\n- ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF261D/62550b81a494c59fe3493af08329ebf8f9d7bb9b.png) $ (1<=i<=n\u00d7t) $ , where operation ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF261D/946bcc44e053027f1f6b5dfc3143583e661988f5.png) means taking the remainder after dividing number $ x $ by number $ y $ .\n\nSequence $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{r} $ of length $ r $ is a subsequence of sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ , if there is such increasing sequence of indexes $ i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{r} $ $ (1<=i_{1}&lt;i_{2}&lt;...\\ &lt;i_{r}<=n) $ , that $ a_{ij}=s_{j} $ . In other words, the subsequence can be obtained from the sequence by crossing out some elements.\n\nSequence $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{r} $ is increasing, if the following inequality holds: $ s_{1}&lt;s_{2}&lt;...&lt;s_{r} $ .\n\nMaxim have $ k $ variants of the sequence $ a $ . Help Maxim to determine for each sequence the length of the longest increasing subsequence.",

Each of the next $ k $ lines contain $ n $ integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ $ (1<=b_{i}<=maxb) $ .\n\nNote that for each variant of the sequence $ a $ the values $ n $ , $ maxb $ and $ t $ coincide, the only arrays $ b $ s differ.\n\nThe numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.",
