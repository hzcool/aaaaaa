    "description": "The teacher gave Anton a large geometry homework, but he didn't do it (as usual) as he participated in a regular round on Codeforces. In the task he was given a set of $ n $ lines defined by the equations $ y=k_{i}\u00b7x+b_{i} $ . It was necessary to determine whether there is at least one point of intersection of two of these lines, that lays strictly inside the strip between $ x_{1}&lt;x_{2} $ . In other words, is it true that there are $ 1<=i&lt;j<=n $ and $ x',y' $ , such that:\n\n- $ y'=k_{i}*x'+b_{i} $ , that is, point $ (x',y') $ belongs to the line number $ i $ ;\n- $ y'=k_{j}*x'+b_{j} $ , that is, point $ (x',y') $ belongs to the line number $ j $ ;\n- $ x_{1}&lt;x'&lt;x_{2} $ , that is, point $ (x',y') $ lies inside the strip bounded by $ x_{1}&lt;x_{2} $ .\n\nYou can't leave Anton in trouble, can you? Write a program that solves the given task.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=100000 $ ) \u2014 the number of lines in the task given to Anton. The second line contains integers $ x_{1} $ and $ x_{2} $ ( $ -1000000<=x_{1}&lt;x_{2}<=1000000 $ ) defining the strip inside which you need to find a point of intersection of at least two lines.\n\nThe following $ n $ lines contain integers $ k_{i} $ , $ b_{i} $ ( $ -1000000<=k_{i},b_{i}<=1000000 $ ) \u2014 the descriptions of the lines. It is guaranteed that all lines are pairwise distinct, that is, for any two $ i\u2260j $ it is true that either $ k_{i}\u2260k_{j} $ , or $ b_{i}\u2260b_{j} $ .",
