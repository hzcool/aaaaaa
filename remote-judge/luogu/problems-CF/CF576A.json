    "description": "Vasya and Petya are playing a simple game. Vasya thought of number $ x $ between $ 1 $ and $ n $ , and Petya tries to guess the number.\n\nPetya can ask questions like: \"Is the unknown number divisible by number $ y $ ?\".\n\nThe game is played by the following rules: first Petya asks all the questions that interest him (also, he can ask no questions), and then Vasya responds to each question with a 'yes' or a 'no'. After receiving all the answers Petya should determine the number that Vasya thought of.\n\nUnfortunately, Petya is not familiar with the number theory. Help him find the minimum number of questions he should ask to make a guaranteed guess of Vasya's number, and the numbers $ y_{i} $ , he should ask the questions about.",

    "hint": "The sequence from the answer to the first sample test is actually correct.\n\nIf the unknown number is not divisible by one of the sequence numbers, it is equal to $ 1 $ .\n\nIf the unknown number is divisible by $ 4 $ , it is $ 4 $ .\n\nIf the unknown number is divisible by $ 3 $ , then the unknown number is $ 3 $ .\n\nOtherwise, it is equal to $ 2 $ . Therefore, the sequence of questions allows you to guess the unknown number. It can be shown that there is no correct sequence of questions of length 2 or shorter.",
