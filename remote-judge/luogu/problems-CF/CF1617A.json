    "description": "You are given strings $ S $ and $ T $ , consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that $ T $ is a permutation of the string abc.\n\nFind string $ S' $ , the lexicographically smallest permutation of $ S $ such that $ T $ is not a subsequence of $ S' $ .\n\nString $ a $ is a permutation of string $ b $ if the number of occurrences of each distinct character is the same in both strings.\n\nA string $ a $ is a subsequence of a string $ b $ if $ a $ can be obtained from $ b $ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.\n\nA string $ a $ is lexicographically smaller than a string $ b $ if and only if one of the following holds:\n\n- $ a $ is a prefix of $ b $ , but $ a \\ne b $ ;\n- in the first position where $ a $ and $ b $ differ, the string $ a $ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $ b $ .",

Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a string $ S $ ( $ 1 \\le |S| \\le 100 $ ), consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $ T $ that is a permutation of the string abc.
