    "description": "One day the Codeforces round author sat exams. He had $ n $ exams and he needed to get an integer from $ 2 $ to $ 5 $ for each exam. He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark $ 2 $ .\n\nThe author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than $ k $ . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than $ k $ , the author's mum won't be pleased at all.\n\nThe Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams.\n\nHelp the author and find the minimum number of exams he will have to re-sit if he passes the exams in the way that makes the sum of marks for all $ n $ exams equal exactly $ k $ .",
