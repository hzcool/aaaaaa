    "description": "In Japan, the number $ 4 $ reads like death, so Bob decided to build a live sequence. Living sequence $ a $ contains all natural numbers that do not contain the digit $ 4 $ . $ a = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, \\ldots] $ .\n\nFor example, the number $ 1235 $ is part of the sequence $ a $ , but the numbers $ 4321 $ , $ 443 $ are not part of the sequence $ a $ .\n\nBob realized that he does not know how to quickly search for a particular number by the position $ k $ in the sequence, so he asks for your help.\n\nFor example, if Bob wants to find the number at position $ k = 4 $ (indexing from $ 1 $ ), you need to answer $ a_k = 5 $ .",
