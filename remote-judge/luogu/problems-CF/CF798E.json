    "description": "Mike has discovered a new way to encode permutations. If he has a permutation $ P=[p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n}] $ , he will encode it in the following way:\n\nDenote by $ A=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}] $ a sequence of length $ n $ which will represent the code of the permutation. For each $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ sequentially, he will choose the smallest unmarked $ j $ ( $ 1<=j<=n $ ) such that $ p_{i}&lt;p_{j} $ and will assign to $ a_{i} $ the number $ j $ (in other words he performs $ a_{i}=j $ ) and will mark $ j $ . If there is no such $ j $ , he'll assign to $ a_{i} $ the number $ -1 $ (he performs $ a_{i}=-1 $ ).\n\nMike forgot his original permutation but he remembers its code. Your task is simple: find any permutation such that its code is the same as the code of Mike's original permutation.\n\nYou may assume that there will always be at least one valid permutation.",

    "outputFormat": "In first and only line print $ n $ numbers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i}<=n $ ) \u2014 a permutation $ P $ which has the same code as the given one. Note that numbers in permutation are distinct.",
