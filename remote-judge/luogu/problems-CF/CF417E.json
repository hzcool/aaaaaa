    "description": "While resting on the ship after the \"Russian Code Cup\" a boy named Misha invented an interesting game. He promised to give his quadrocopter to whoever will be the first one to make a rectangular table of size $ n\u00d7m $ , consisting of positive integers such that the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column was also a square.\n\nSince checking the correctness of the table manually is difficult, Misha asks you to make each number in the table to not exceed $ 10^{8} $ .",
