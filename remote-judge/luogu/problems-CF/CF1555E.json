    "description": "You are given $ n $ segments on a number line, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The $ i $ -th segments covers all integer points from $ l_i $ to $ r_i $ and has a value $ w_i $ .\n\nYou are asked to select a subset of these segments (possibly, all of them). Once the subset is selected, it's possible to travel between two integer points if there exists a selected segment that covers both of them. A subset is good if it's possible to reach point $ m $ starting from point $ 1 $ in arbitrary number of moves.\n\nThe cost of the subset is the difference between the maximum and the minimum values of segments in it. Find the minimum cost of a good subset.\n\nIn every test there exists at least one good subset.",
