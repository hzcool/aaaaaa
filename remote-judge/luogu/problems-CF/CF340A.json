    "description": "Iahub and his friend Floyd have started painting a wall. Iahub is painting the wall red and Floyd is painting it pink. You can consider the wall being made of a very large number of bricks, numbered $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ and so on.\n\nIahub has the following scheme of painting: he skips $ x-1 $ consecutive bricks, then he paints the $ x $ -th one. That is, he'll paint bricks $ x $ , $ 2\u00b7x $ , $ 3\u00b7x $ and so on red. Similarly, Floyd skips $ y-1 $ consecutive bricks, then he paints the $ y $ -th one. Hence he'll paint bricks $ y $ , $ 2\u00b7y $ , $ 3\u00b7y $ and so on pink.\n\nAfter painting the wall all day, the boys observed that some bricks are painted both red and pink. Iahub has a lucky number $ a $ and Floyd has a lucky number $ b $ . Boys wonder how many bricks numbered no less than $ a $ and no greater than $ b $ are painted both red and pink. This is exactly your task: compute and print the answer to the question.",
