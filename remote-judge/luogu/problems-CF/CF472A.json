    "description": "One way to create a task is to learn from math. You can generate some random math statement or modify some theorems to get something new and build a new task from that.\n\nFor example, there is a statement called the \"Goldbach's conjecture\". It says: \"each even number no less than four can be expressed as the sum of two primes\". Let's modify it. How about a statement like that: \"each integer no less than 12 can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers.\" Not like the Goldbach's conjecture, I can prove this theorem.\n\nYou are given an integer $ n $ no less than 12, express it as a sum of two composite numbers.",

    "outputFormat": "Output two composite integers $ x $ and $ y $ $ (1<x,y<n) $ such that $ x+y=n $ . If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.",
