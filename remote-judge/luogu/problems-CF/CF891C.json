    "description": "For a connected undirected weighted graph $ G $ , MST (minimum spanning tree) is a subgraph of $ G $ that contains all of $ G $ 's vertices, is a tree, and sum of its edges is minimum possible.\n\nYou are given a graph $ G $ . If you run a MST algorithm on graph it would give you only one MST and it causes other edges to become jealous. You are given some queries, each query contains a set of edges of graph $ G $ , and you should determine whether there is a MST containing all these edges or not.",

There can be more than one edges between two vertices. It's guaranteed that the given graph is connected.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=5\u00b710^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\n $ q $ lines follow, the $ i $ -th of them contains the $ i $ -th query. It starts with an integer $ k_{i} $ ( $ 1<=k_{i}<=n-1 $ ) \u2014 the size of edges subset and continues with $ k_{i} $ distinct space-separated integers from $ 1 $ to $ m $ \u2014 the indices of the edges.
