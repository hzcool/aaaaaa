    "description": "There is a game called \"I Wanna Be the Guy\", consisting of $ n $ levels. Little X and his friend Little Y are addicted to the game. Each of them wants to pass the whole game.\n\nLittle X can pass only $ p $ levels of the game. And Little Y can pass only $ q $ levels of the game. You are given the indices of levels Little X can pass and the indices of levels Little Y can pass. Will Little X and Little Y pass the whole game, if they cooperate each other?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ).\n\nThe next line contains an integer $ p $ $ (0<=p<=n) $ at first, then follows $ p $ distinct integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{p} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=n) $ . These integers denote the indices of levels Little X can pass. The next line contains the levels Little Y can pass in the same format. It's assumed that levels are numbered from 1 to $ n $ .",
    "outputFormat": "If they can pass all the levels, print \"I become the guy.\". If it's impossible, print \"Oh, my keyboard!\" (without the quotes).",
