    "description": "Now you can take online courses in the Berland State University! Polycarp needs to pass $ k $ main online courses of his specialty to get a diploma. In total $ n $ courses are availiable for the passage.\n\nThe situation is complicated by the dependence of online courses, for each course there is a list of those that must be passed before starting this online course (the list can be empty, it means that there is no limitation).\n\nHelp Polycarp to pass the least number of courses in total to get the specialty (it means to pass all main and necessary courses). Write a program which prints the order of courses.\n\nPolycarp passes courses consistently, he starts the next course when he finishes the previous one. Each course can't be passed more than once.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n<=10^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of online-courses and the number of main courses of Polycarp's specialty.\n\nThe second line contains $ k $ distinct integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ \u2014 numbers of main online-courses of Polycarp's specialty.\n\nThen $ n $ lines follow, each of them describes the next course: the $ i $ -th of them corresponds to the course $ i $ . Each line starts from the integer $ t_{i} $ ( $ 0<=t_{i}<=n-1 $ ) \u2014 the number of courses on which the $ i $ -th depends. Then there follows the sequence of $ t_{i} $ distinct integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ \u2014 numbers of courses in random order, on which the $ i $ -th depends. It is guaranteed that no course can depend on itself.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all values $ t_{i} $ doesn't exceed $ 10^{5} $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Print -1, if there is no the way to get a specialty.\n\nOtherwise, in the first line print the integer $ m $ \u2014 the minimum number of online-courses which it is necessary to pass to get a specialty. In the second line print $ m $ distinct integers \u2014 numbers of courses which it is necessary to pass in the chronological order of their passage. If there are several answers it is allowed to print any of them.",
