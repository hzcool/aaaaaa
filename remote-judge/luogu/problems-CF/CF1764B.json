    "description": "\"Everybody! Doremy's Perfect Math Class is about to start! Come and do your best if you want to have as much IQ as me!\" In today's math class, Doremy is teaching everyone subtraction. Now she gives you a quiz to prove that you are paying attention in class.\n\nYou are given a set $ S $ containing positive integers. You may perform the following operation some (possibly zero) number of times:\n\n- choose two integers $ x $ and $ y $ from the set $ S $ such that $ x > y $ and $ x - y $ is not in the set $ S $ .\n- add $ x-y $ into the set $ S $ .\n\nYou need to tell Doremy the maximum possible number of integers in $ S $ if the operations are performed optimally. It can be proven that this number is finite.",
    "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1\\le t\\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n\\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the size of the set $ S $ .\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n $ ( $ 1\\le a_1 < a_2 < \\cdots < a_n \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the positive integers in $ S $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2\\cdot 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, you need to output the maximum possible number of integers in $ S $ . It can be proven that this value is finite.",

        [

        ]
    ],
    "hint": "In the first test case, no such $ x $ and $ y $ exist. The maximum possible number of integers in $ S $ is $ 2 $ .\n\nIn the second test case,\n\n- $ S=\\{5,10,25\\} $ at first. You can choose $ x=25 $ , $ y=10 $ , then add $ x-y=15 $ to the set.\n- $ S=\\{5,10,15,25\\} $ now. You can choose $ x=25 $ , $ y=5 $ , then add $ x-y=20 $ to the set.\n- $ S=\\{5,10,15,20,25\\} $ now. You can not perform any operation now.\n\nAfter performing all operations, the number of integers in $ S $ is $ 5 $ . It can be proven that no other sequence of operations allows $ S $ to contain more than $ 5 $ integers.",
