Indeed, she has spent some time reading several recipe books, including the universally acclaimed \"The Art of the Covfefe\".\n\nShe knows $ n $ coffee recipes. The $ i $ -th recipe suggests that coffee should be brewed between $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ degrees, inclusive, to achieve the optimal taste.\n\nKaren thinks that a temperature is admissible if at least $ k $ recipes recommend it.\n\nKaren has a rather fickle mind, and so she asks $ q $ questions. In each question, given that she only wants to prepare coffee with a temperature between $ a $ and $ b $ , inclusive, can you tell her how many admissible integer temperatures fall within the range?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains three integers, $ n $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n<=200000 $ ), and $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=200000 $ ), the number of recipes, the minimum number of recipes a certain temperature must be recommended by to be admissible, and the number of questions Karen has, respectively.\n\nThe next $ n $ lines describe the recipes. Specifically, the $ i $ -th line among these contains two integers $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=200000 $ ), describing that the $ i $ -th recipe suggests that the coffee be brewed between $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ degrees, inclusive.\n\nThe next $ q $ lines describe the questions. Each of these lines contains $ a $ and $ b $ , ( $ 1<=a<=b<=200000 $ ), describing that she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures between $ a $ and $ b $ degrees, inclusive.",
    "outputFormat": "For each question, output a single integer on a line by itself, the number of admissible integer temperatures between $ a $ and $ b $ degrees, inclusive.",

The third one recommends brewing the coffee between $ 97 $ and $ 99 $ degrees, inclusive.\n\nA temperature is admissible if at least $ 2 $ recipes recommend it.\n\nShe asks $ 4 $ questions.\n\nIn her first question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures between $ 92 $ and $ 94 $ degrees, inclusive. There are $ 3 $ : $ 92 $ , $ 93 $ and $ 94 $ degrees are all admissible.\n\nIn her second question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures between $ 93 $ and $ 97 $ degrees, inclusive. There are $ 3 $ : $ 93 $ , $ 94 $ and $ 97 $ degrees are all admissible.\n\nIn her third question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures between $ 95 $ and $ 96 $ degrees, inclusive. There are none.\n\nIn her final question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures between $ 90 $ and $ 100 $ degrees, inclusive. There are $ 4 $ : $ 92 $ , $ 93 $ , $ 94 $ and $ 97 $ degrees are all admissible.\n\nIn the second test case, Karen knows $ 2 $ recipes.\n\n1. The first one, \"wikiHow to make Cold Brew Coffee\", recommends brewing the coffee at exactly $ 1 $ degree.\n2. The second one, \"What good is coffee that isn't brewed at at least $ 36.3306 $ times the temperature of the surface of the sun?\", recommends brewing the coffee at exactly $ 200000 $ degrees.\n\nA temperature is admissible if at least $ 1 $ recipe recommends it.\n\nIn her first and only question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures that are actually reasonable. There are none.",
