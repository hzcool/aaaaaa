    "description": "After a long party Petya decided to return home, but he turned out to be at the opposite end of the town from his home. There are $ n $ crossroads in the line in the town, and there is either the bus or the tram station at each crossroad.\n\nThe crossroads are represented as a string $ s $ of length $ n $ , where $ s_i = \\texttt{A} $ , if there is a bus station at $ i $ -th crossroad, and $ s_i = \\texttt{B} $ , if there is a tram station at $ i $ -th crossroad. Currently Petya is at the first crossroad (which corresponds to $ s_1 $ ) and his goal is to get to the last crossroad (which corresponds to $ s_n $ ).\n\nIf for two crossroads $ i $ and $ j $ for all crossroads $ i, i+1, \\ldots, j-1 $ there is a bus station, one can pay $ a $ roubles for the bus ticket, and go from $ i $ -th crossroad to the $ j $ -th crossroad by the bus (it is not necessary to have a bus station at the $ j $ -th crossroad). Formally, paying $ a $ roubles Petya can go from $ i $ to $ j $ if $ s_t = \\texttt{A} $ for all $ i \\le t < j $ .\n\nIf for two crossroads $ i $ and $ j $ for all crossroads $ i, i+1, \\ldots, j-1 $ there is a tram station, one can pay $ b $ roubles for the tram ticket, and go from $ i $ -th crossroad to the $ j $ -th crossroad by the tram (it is not necessary to have a tram station at the $ j $ -th crossroad). Formally, paying $ b $ roubles Petya can go from $ i $ to $ j $ if $ s_t = \\texttt{B} $ for all $ i \\le t < j $ .\n\nFor example, if $ s $ =\"AABBBAB\", $ a=4 $ and $ b=3 $ then Petya needs:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1315B/d31ad11df9d2427f4328b4ae4effdedae0648f44.png)- buy one bus ticket to get from $ 1 $ to $ 3 $ ,\n- buy one tram ticket to get from $ 3 $ to $ 6 $ ,\n- buy one bus ticket to get from $ 6 $ to $ 7 $ .\n\nThus, in total he needs to spend $ 4+3+4=11 $ roubles. Please note that the type of the stop at the last crossroad (i.e. the character $ s_n $ ) does not affect the final expense.\n\nNow Petya is at the first crossroad, and he wants to get to the $ n $ -th crossroad. After the party he has left with $ p $ roubles. He's decided to go to some station on foot, and then go to home using only public transport.\n\nHelp him to choose the closest crossroad $ i $ to go on foot the first, so he has enough money to get from the $ i $ -th crossroad to the $ n $ -th, using only tram and bus tickets.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ).\n\nThe first line of each test case consists of three integers $ a, b, p $ ( $ 1 \\le a, b, p \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the cost of bus ticket, the cost of tram ticket and the amount of money Petya has.\n\nThe second line of each test case consists of one string $ s $ , where $ s_i = \\texttt{A} $ , if there is a bus station at $ i $ -th crossroad, and $ s_i = \\texttt{B} $ , if there is a tram station at $ i $ -th crossroad ( $ 2 \\le |s| \\le 10^5 $ ).\n\nIt is guaranteed, that the sum of the length of strings $ s $ by all test cases in one test doesn't exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
