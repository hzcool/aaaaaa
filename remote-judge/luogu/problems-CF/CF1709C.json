    "description": "A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters \"(\" and \")\". A regular bracket sequence (or, shortly, an RBS) is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \"1\" and \"+\" between the original characters of the sequence. For example:\n\n- bracket sequences \"()()\" and \"(())\" are regular (the resulting expressions are: \"(1)+(1)\" and \"((1+1)+1)\");\n- bracket sequences \")(\", \"(\" and \")\" are not.\n\nThere was an RBS. Some brackets have been replaced with question marks. Is it true that there is a unique way to replace question marks with brackets, so that the resulting sequence is an RBS?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe only line of each testcase contains an RBS with some brackets replaced with question marks. Each character is either '(', ')' or '?'. At least one RBS can be recovered from the given sequence.\n\nThe total length of the sequences over all testcases doesn't exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print \"YES\" if the way to replace question marks with brackets, so that the resulting sequence is an RBS, is unique. If there is more than one way, then print \"NO\".",
