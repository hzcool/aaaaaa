There will be $ n $ singers who will perform at the festival, identified by the integers $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , $ \\dots $ , $ n $ . You must choose in which order they are going to perform on stage.\n\nYou have $ m $ friends and each of them has a set of favourite singers. More precisely, for each $ 1\\le i\\le m $ , the $ i $ -th friend likes singers $ s_{i,1}, \\, s_{i, 2}, \\, \\dots, \\,s_{i, q_i} $ .\n\nA friend of yours is happy if the singers he likes perform consecutively (in an arbitrary order). An ordering of the singers is valid if it makes all your friends happy.\n\nCompute the number of valid orderings modulo $ 998\\,244\\,353 $ .",

Thus, the $ 4 $ valid orderings are:\n\n- 1 3 2\n- 2 1 3\n- 2 3 1\n- 3 1 2\n\nExplanation of the second sample: There are $ 5 $ singers and $ 5 $ friends. One can show that no ordering is valid.\n\nExplanation of the third sample: There are $ 100 $ singers and only $ 1 $ friend. The friend likes only singer $ 50 $ , hence all the $ 100! $ possible orderings are valid.\n\nExplanation of the fourth sample: There are $ 5 $ singers and only $ 1 $ friend. The friend likes all the singers, hence all the $ 5!=120 $ possible orderings are valid.",
