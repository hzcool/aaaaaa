    "description": "Alice likes snow a lot! Unfortunately, this year's winter is already over, and she can't expect to have any more of it. Bob has thus bought her a gift \u2014 a large snow maker. He plans to make some amount of snow every day. On day $ i $ he will make a pile of snow of volume $ V_{i} $ and put it in her garden.\n\nEach day, every pile will shrink a little due to melting. More precisely, when the temperature on a given day is $ T_{i} $ , each pile will reduce its volume by $ T_{i} $ . If this would reduce the volume of a pile to or below zero, it disappears forever. All snow piles are independent of each other.\n\nNote that the pile made on day $ i $ already loses part of its volume on the same day. In an extreme case, this may mean that there are no piles left at the end of a particular day.\n\nYou are given the initial pile sizes and the temperature on each day. Determine the total volume of snow melted on each day.",

    "hint": "In the first sample, Bob first makes a snow pile of volume 10, which melts to the size of 5 on the same day. On the second day, he makes another pile of size 10. Since it is a bit warmer than the day before, the first pile disappears completely while the second pile shrinks to 3. At the end of the second day, he has only a single pile of size 3. On the third day he makes a smaller pile than usual, but as the temperature dropped too, both piles survive till the end of the day.",
