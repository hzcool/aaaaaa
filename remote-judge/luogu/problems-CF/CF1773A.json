    "description": "Alice is a magician and she creates a new trick. She has $ n $ cards with different numbers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ written on them. First, she asks an audience member to shuffle the deck and put cards in a row. Let's say the $ i $ -th card from the left has the number $ a_i $ on it.\n\nThen Alice picks two permutations $ p $ and $ q $ . There is a restriction on $ p $ and $ q $ \u2014 permutations can't have fixed points. Which means $ \\forall i: p_i \\ne i\\ and\\ q_i \\ne i $ .\n\nAfter permutations are chosen, Alice shuffles the cards according to them. Now the $ i $ -th card from the left is the card $ a[p[q[i]] $ . The trick is considered successful if $ i $ -th card from the left has the number $ i $ on it after the shuffles.\n\nHelp Alice pick the permutations $ p $ and $ q $ or say it is not possible for the specific starting permutation $ a $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains the number of tests $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5 $ ).\n\nEach test is described in two lines. The first line contains one integer $ n $ \u2014 the number of cards ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $ ). The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_i $ \u2014 the initial permutation of the cards ( $ 1 \\leq a_i \\leq n $ ; $ \\forall i \\neq j: a_i \\neq a_j $ ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all tests does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Print the answer for each test case in the same order the cases appear in the input.\n\nFor each test case, print \"Impossible\" in a single line, if no solution exists.\n\nOtherwise, print \"Possible\" in the first line, and in the following two lines print permutations $ p $ and $ q $ .",
