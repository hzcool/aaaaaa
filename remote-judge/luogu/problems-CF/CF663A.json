    "description": "You are given a rebus of form ? + ? - ? + ? = n, consisting of only question marks, separated by arithmetic operation '+' and '-', equality and positive integer $ n $ . The goal is to replace each question mark with some positive integer from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , such that equality holds.",
    "inputFormat": "The only line of the input contains a rebus. It's guaranteed that it contains no more than $ 100 $ question marks, integer $ n $ is positive and doesn't exceed $ 1000000 $ , all letters and integers are separated by spaces, arithmetic operations are located only between question marks.",
    "outputFormat": "The first line of the output should contain \"Possible\" (without quotes) if rebus has a solution and \"Impossible\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nIf the answer exists, the second line should contain any valid rebus with question marks replaced by integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Follow the format given in the samples.",
