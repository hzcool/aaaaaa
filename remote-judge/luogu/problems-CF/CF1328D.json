    "description": "The round carousel consists of $ n $ figures of animals. Figures are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in order of the carousel moving. Thus, after the $ n $ -th figure the figure with the number $ 1 $ follows. Each figure has its own type \u2014 the type of the animal corresponding to this figure (the horse, the tiger and so on). The type of animal of the $ i $ -th figure equals $ t_i $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1328D/6fef0d63a3e427398bbe634881f56ca00339f29a.png)The example of the carousel for $ n=9 $ and $ t=[5, 5, 1, 15, 1, 5, 5, 1, 1] $ . You want to color each figure in one of the colors. You think that it's boring if the carousel contains two different figures (with the distinct types of animals) going one right after another and colored in the same color.\n\nYour task is to color the figures in such a way that the number of distinct colors used is the minimum possible and there are no figures of the different types going one right after another and colored in the same color. If you use exactly $ k $ distinct colors, then the colors of figures should be denoted with integers from $ 1 $ to $ k $ .",

Then $ q $ test cases follow. One test case is given on two lines.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of figures in the carousel. Figures are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in order of carousel moving.
