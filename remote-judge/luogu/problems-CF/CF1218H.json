    "description": "We are definitely not going to bother you with another generic story when Alice finds about an array or when Alice and Bob play some stupid game. This time you'll get a simple, plain text.\n\nFirst, let us define several things. We define function $ F $ on the array $ A $ such that $ F(i, 1) = A[i] $ and $ F(i, m) = A[F(i, m - 1)] $ for $ m > 1 $ . In other words, value $ F(i, m) $ represents composition $ A[...A[i]] $ applied $ m $ times.\n\nYou are given an array of length $ N $ with non-negative integers. You are expected to give an answer on $ Q $ queries. Each query consists of two numbers \u2013 $ m $ and $ y $ . For each query determine how many $ x $ exist such that $ F(x,m) = y $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ N $ $ (1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5) $ \u2013 the size of the array $ A $ . The next line contains $ N $ non-negative integers \u2013 the array $ A $ itself $ (1 \\leq A_i \\leq N) $ . The next line contains one integer $ Q $ $ (1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^5) $ \u2013 the number of queries. Each of the next $ Q $ lines contain two integers $ m $ and $ y $ $ (1 \\leq m \\leq 10^{18}, 1\\leq y \\leq N) $ .",
