    "description": "Nick likes strings very much, he likes to rotate them, sort them, rearrange characters within a string... Once he wrote a random string of characters a, b, c on a piece of paper and began to perform the following operations:\n\n- to take two adjacent characters and replace the second character with the first one,\n- to take two adjacent characters and replace the first character with the second one\n\nTo understand these actions better, let's take a look at a string \u00ababc\u00bb. All of the following strings can be obtained by performing one of the described operations on \u00ababc\u00bb: \u00abbbc\u00bb, \u00ababb\u00bb, \u00abacc\u00bb. Let's denote the frequency of a character for each of the characters a, b and c as the number of occurrences of this character in the string. For example, for string \u00ababc\u00bb: | $ a $ | = 1, | $ b $ | = 1, | $ c $ | = 1, and for string \u00abbbc\u00bb: | $ a $ | = 0, | $ b $ | = 2, | $ c $ | = 1.\n\nWhile performing the described operations, Nick sometimes got balanced strings. Let's say that a string is balanced, if the frequencies of each character differ by at most 1. That is $ -1<=|a|-|b|<=1 $ , $ -1<=|a|-|c|<=1 $ \u0438 $ -1<=|b|-|c|<=1 $ .\n\nWould you help Nick find the number of different balanced strings that can be obtained by performing the operations described above, perhaps multiple times, on the given string $ s $ . This number should be calculated modulo $ 51123987 $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=150 $ ) \u2014 the length of the given string $ s $ . Next line contains the given string $ s $ . The initial string can be balanced as well, in this case it should be counted too. The given string $ s $ consists only of characters a, b and c.",
