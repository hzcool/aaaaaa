    "description": "Alex enjoys performing magic tricks. He has a trick that requires a deck of $ n $ cards. He has $ m $ identical decks of $ n $ different cards each, which have been mixed together. When Alex wishes to perform the trick, he grabs $ n $ cards at random and performs the trick with those. The resulting deck looks like a normal deck, but may have duplicates of some cards.\n\nThe trick itself is performed as follows: first Alex allows you to choose a random card from the deck. You memorize the card and put it back in the deck. Then Alex shuffles the deck, and pulls out a card. If the card matches the one you memorized, the trick is successful.\n\nYou don't think Alex is a very good magician, and that he just pulls a card randomly from the deck. Determine the probability of the trick being successful if this is the case.",
