    "description": "DZY loves strings, and he enjoys collecting them.\n\nIn China, many people like to use strings containing their names' initials, for example: xyz, jcvb, dzy, dyh.\n\nOnce DZY found a lucky string $ s $ . A lot of pairs of good friends came to DZY when they heard about the news. The first member of the $ i $ -th pair has name $ a_{i} $ , the second one has name $ b_{i} $ . Each pair wondered if there is a substring of the lucky string containing both of their names. If so, they want to find the one with minimum length, which can give them good luck and make their friendship last forever.\n\nPlease help DZY for each pair find the minimum length of the substring of $ s $ that contains both $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ , or point out that such substring doesn't exist.\n\nA substring of $ s $ is a string $ s_{l}s_{l+1}...\\ s_{r} $ for some integers $ l,r $ $ (1<=l<=r<=|s|) $ . The length of such the substring is $ (r-l+1) $ .\n\nA string $ p $ contains some another string $ q $ if there is a substring of $ p $ equal to $ q $ .",

Each of the next $ q $ lines describes a pair, the line contains two space-separated strings $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ $ (1<=|a_{i}|,|b_{i}|<=4) $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that all the strings only consist of lowercase English letters.",
