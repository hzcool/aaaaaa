    "description": "As a teacher, Riko Hakozaki often needs to help her students with problems from various subjects. Today, she is asked a programming task which goes as follows.\n\nYou are given an undirected complete graph with $ n $ nodes, where some edges are pre-assigned with a positive weight while the rest aren't. You need to assign all unassigned edges with non-negative weights so that in the resulting fully-assigned complete graph the [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) sum of all weights would be equal to $ 0 $ .\n\nDefine the ugliness of a fully-assigned complete graph the weight of its [minimum spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree), where the weight of a spanning tree equals the sum of weights of its edges. You need to assign the weights so that the ugliness of the resulting graph is as small as possible.\n\nAs a reminder, an undirected complete graph with $ n $ nodes contains all edges $ (u, v) $ with $ 1 \\le u < v \\le n $ ; such a graph has $ \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} $ edges.\n\nShe is not sure how to solve this problem, so she asks you to solve it for her.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ , $ 0 \\le m \\le \\min(2 \\cdot 10^5, \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} - 1) $ ) \u2014 the number of nodes and the number of pre-assigned edges. The inputs are given so that there is at least one unassigned edge.\n\nThe $ i $ -th of the following $ m $ lines contains three integers $ u_i $ , $ v_i $ , and $ w_i $ ( $ 1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n $ , $ u \\ne v $ , $ 1 \\le w_i < 2^{30} $ ), representing the edge from $ u_i $ to $ v_i $ has been pre-assigned with the weight $ w_i $ . No edge appears in the input more than once.",
