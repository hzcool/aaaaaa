    "description": "You are given a simple undirected graph consisting of $ n $ vertices. The graph doesn't contain self-loops, there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices. Your task is simple: make the graph connected.\n\nYou can do the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\n\n- Choose a vertex $ u $ arbitrarily.\n- For each vertex $ v $ satisfying $ v\\ne u $ in the graph individually, if $ v $ is adjacent to $ u $ , remove the edge between $ u $ and $ v $ , otherwise add an edge between $ u $ and $ v $ .\n\nFind the minimum number of operations required to make the graph connected. Also, find any sequence of operations with the minimum length that makes the graph connected.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1\\leq t\\leq 800 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2\\leq n\\leq 4000 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nThen $ n $ lines follow. The $ i $ -th row contains a binary string $ s_i $ of length $ n $ , where $ s_{i,j} $ is '1' if there is an edge between vertex $ i $ and $ j $ initially, otherwise $ s_{i,j} $ is '0'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that $ s_{i,i} $ is always '0' and $ s_{i,j}=s_{j,i} $ for $ 1\\leq i,j\\leq n $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 4000 $ .",

If there are multiple solutions with the minimum number of operations, print any.",
