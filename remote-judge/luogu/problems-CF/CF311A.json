    "description": "Currently Tiny is learning Computational Geometry. When trying to solve a problem called \"The Closest Pair Of Points In The Plane\", he found that a code which gave a wrong time complexity got Accepted instead of Time Limit Exceeded.\n\nThe problem is the follows. Given $ n $ points in the plane, find a pair of points between which the distance is minimized. Distance between $ (x_{1},y_{1}) $ and $ (x_{2},y_{2}) $ is ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF311A/22fd88ba9a7f84161b680cf39a97d9a06bc287ba.png).\n\nThe pseudo code of the unexpected code is as follows:\n\n`<br></br>input n<br></br>for i from 1 to n<br></br>    input the i-th point's coordinates into p[i]<br></br>sort array p[] by increasing of x coordinate first and increasing of y coordinate second<br></br>d=INF        //here INF is a number big enough<br></br>tot=0<br></br>for i from 1 to n<br></br>    for j from (i+1) to n<br></br>        ++tot<br></br>        if (p[j].x-p[i].x>=d) then break    //notice that \"break\" is only to be<br></br>                                            //out of the loop \"for j\"<br></br>        d=min(d,distance(p[i],p[j]))<br></br>output d<br></br>`Here, $ tot $ can be regarded as the running time of the code. Due to the fact that a computer can only run a limited number of operations per second, $ tot $ should not be more than $ k $ in order not to get Time Limit Exceeded.\n\nYou are a great hacker. Would you please help Tiny generate a test data and let the code get Time Limit Exceeded?",
