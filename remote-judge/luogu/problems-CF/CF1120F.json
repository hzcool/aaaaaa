    "description": "Little W and Little P decided to send letters to each other regarding the most important events during a day. There are $ n $ events during a day: at time moment $ t_i $ something happens to the person $ p_i $ ( $ p_i $ is either W or P, denoting Little W and Little P, respectively), so he needs to immediately send a letter to the other person. They can send a letter using one of the two ways:\n\n- Ask Friendly O to deliver the letter directly. Friendly O takes $ d $ acorns for each letter.\n- Leave the letter at Wise R's den. Wise R values free space, so he takes $ c \\cdot T $ acorns for storing a letter for a time segment of length $ T $ . The recipient can take a letter from Wise R either when he leaves his own letter at Wise R's den, or at time moment $ t_{n + 1} $ , when everybody comes to Wise R for a tea. It is not possible to take a letter from Wise R's den at other time moments. The friends can store as many letters at Wise R's den as they want, paying for each one separately.\n\nHelp the friends determine the minimum possible total cost of sending all letters.",

The $ i $ -th of them contains an integer $ t_i $ and a character $ p_i $ ( $ 0 \\leq t_i \\leq 10^6 $ , $ p_i $ is either W or P) \u2014 the time the $ i $ -th event happens and the person the event happens to.\n\nThe last line contains a single integer $ t_{n + 1} $ ( $ 0 \\leq t_{n+1} \\leq 10^6 $ ) \u2014 the time when everybody comes to Wise R for a tea and takes all remaining letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that $ t_i < t_{i + 1} $ for all $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .",

This letter is at the den from time moment 0 to time moment 1, it costs $ 1 $ acorn.\n- At time moment 3 Little P sends his letter via Friendly O, it costs $ 4 $ acorns.\n- At time moment 5 Little P leaves his letter at the den, receiving Little W's letter which storage costs 4 acorns.\n- At time moment 8 Little P leaves one more letter at the den.\n- At time moment 10 Little W comes to the den for a tea and receives the two letters, paying 5 and 2 acorns.\n\nThe total cost of delivery is thus $ 1 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 16 $ acorns.",
