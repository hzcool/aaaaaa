    "description": "As you might remember from the previous round, Vova is currently playing a strategic game known as Rage of Empires.\n\nVova managed to build a large army, but forgot about the main person in the army - the commander. So he tries to hire a commander, and he wants to choose the person who will be respected by warriors.\n\nEach warrior is represented by his personality \u2014 an integer number $ p_{i} $ . Each commander has two characteristics \u2014 his personality $ p_{j} $ and leadership $ l_{j} $ (both are integer numbers). Warrior $ i $ respects commander $ j $ only if ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF817E/b16f95ca4b565c33ddcd184eb553a25fa59f1c3f.png) (![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF817E/a0b0fe9e9428287337c0277ea02ca07fcf0a01a7.png) is the bitwise excluding OR of $ x $ and $ y $ ).\n\nInitially Vova's army is empty. There are three different types of events that can happen with the army:\n\n- $ 1\u00a0p_{i} $ \u2014 one warrior with personality $ p_{i} $ joins Vova's army;\n- $ 2\u00a0p_{i} $ \u2014 one warrior with personality $ p_{i} $ leaves Vova's army;\n- $ 3\u00a0p_{i}\u00a0l_{i} $ \u2014 Vova tries to hire a commander with personality $ p_{i} $ and leadership $ l_{i} $ .\n\nFor each event of the third type Vova wants to know how many warriors (counting only those who joined the army and haven't left yet) respect the commander he tries to hire.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=100000 $ ) \u2014 the number of events.\n\nThen $ q $ lines follow. Each line describes the event:\n\n- $ 1\u00a0p_{i} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i}<=10^{8} $ ) \u2014 one warrior with personality $ p_{i} $ joins Vova's army;\n- $ 2\u00a0p_{i} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i}<=10^{8} $ ) \u2014 one warrior with personality $ p_{i} $ leaves Vova's army (it is guaranteed that there is at least one such warrior in Vova's army by this moment);\n- $ 3\u00a0p_{i}\u00a0l_{i} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i},l_{i}<=10^{8} $ ) \u2014 Vova tries to hire a commander with personality $ p_{i} $ and leadership $ l_{i} $ .
