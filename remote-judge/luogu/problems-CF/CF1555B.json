The sides of the table are parallel to the walls, the lower left corner is in $ (x_1, y_1) $ , and the upper right corner in $ (x_2, y_2) $ .\n\nYou want to place another rectangular table in this room with width $ w $ and height $ h $ with the width of the table parallel to the width of the room.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes there is not enough space to place the second table without intersecting with the first one (there are no problems with tables touching, though).\n\nYou can't rotate any of the tables, but you can move the first table inside the room.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1555B/148c3af8c708a59f4665d57c0e4342daba4e07ae.png)Example of how you may move the first table.What is the minimum distance you should move the first table to free enough space for the second one?",

    "hint": "The configuration of the first test case is shown in the picture. But the movement of the first table is not optimal. One of the optimal movement, for example, is to move the table by $ (0, -1) $ , so the lower left corner will move from $ (2, 1) $ to $ (2, 0) $ . Then you can place the second table at $ (0, 3)-(4, 5) $ .\n\nIn the second test case, there is no way to fit both tables in the room without intersecting.\n\nIn the third test case, you can move the first table by $ (0, 2) $ , so the lower left corner will move from $ (0, 3) $ to $ (0, 5) $ .",
