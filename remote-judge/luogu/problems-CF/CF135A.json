    "description": "Little Petya very much likes arrays consisting of $ n $ integers, where each of them is in the range from $ 1 $ to $ 10^{9} $ , inclusive. Recently he has received one such array as a gift from his mother. Petya didn't like it at once. He decided to choose exactly one element from the array and replace it with another integer that also lies in the range from $ 1 $ to $ 10^{9} $ , inclusive. It is not allowed to replace a number with itself or to change no number at all.\n\nAfter the replacement Petya sorted the array by the numbers' non-decreasing. Now he wants to know for each position: what minimum number could occupy it after the replacement and the sorting.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ), which represents how many numbers the array has. The next line contains $ n $ space-separated integers \u2014 the array's description. All elements of the array lie in the range from $ 1 $ to $ 10^{9} $ , inclusive.",
    "outputFormat": "Print $ n $ space-separated integers \u2014 the minimum possible values of each array element after one replacement and the sorting are performed.",
