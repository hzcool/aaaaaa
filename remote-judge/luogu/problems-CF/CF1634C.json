    "description": "People worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they're too stupid and they've already taken over the world.\n\n\u2014 Pedro Domingos\n\n\n\nYou work for a well-known department store that uses leading technologies and employs mechanistic work \u2014 that is, robots!\n\nThe department you work in sells $ n \\cdot k $ items. The first item costs $ 1 $ dollar, the second item costs $ 2 $ dollars, and so on: $ i $ -th item costs $ i $ dollars. The items are situated on shelves. The items form a rectangular grid: there are $ n $ shelves in total, and each shelf contains exactly $ k $ items. We will denote by $ a_{i,j} $ the price of $ j $ -th item (counting from the left) on the $ i $ -th shelf, $ 1 \\le i \\le n, 1 \\le j \\le k $ .\n\nOccasionally robots get curious and ponder on the following question: what is the mean price (arithmetic average) of items $ a_{i,l}, a_{i,l+1}, \\ldots, a_{i,r} $ for some shelf $ i $ and indices $ l \\le r $ ? Unfortunately, the old robots can only work with whole numbers. If the mean price turns out not to be an integer, they break down.\n\nYou care about robots' welfare. You want to arrange the items in such a way that the robots cannot theoretically break. Formally, you want to choose such a two-dimensional array $ a $ that:\n\n- Every number from $ 1 $ to $ n \\cdot k $ (inclusively) occurs exactly once.\n- For each $ i, l, r $ , the mean price of items from $ l $ to $ r $ on $ i $ -th shelf is an integer.\n\nFind out if such an arrangement is possible, and if it is, give any example of such arrangement.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 500 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le n, k \\le 500 $ ) \u2014 the number of shelves and length of each shelf, respectively.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 500 $ and the sum $ k $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 500 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Print the answer for each test case.\n\nIf such an arrangement exists, print \"YES\" on a single line. After that, print any example on $ n $ lines of $ k $ numbers each, one line per shelf. Each number from $ 1 $ to $ n \\cdot k $ must occur exactly once in the output.\n\nIf no good arrangement exists, print a single word \"NO\" on its own line.",
