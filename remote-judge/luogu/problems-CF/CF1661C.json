    "description": "There are $ n $ trees in a park, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The initial height of the $ i $ -th tree is $ h_i $ .\n\nYou want to water these trees, so they all grow to the same height.\n\nThe watering process goes as follows. You start watering trees at day $ 1 $ . During the $ j $ -th day you can:\n\n- Choose a tree and water it. If the day is odd (e.g. $ 1, 3, 5, 7, \\dots $ ), then the height of the tree increases by $ 1 $ . If the day is even (e.g. $ 2, 4, 6, 8, \\dots $ ), then the height of the tree increases by $ 2 $ .\n- Or skip a day without watering any tree.\n\nNote that you can't water more than one tree in a day.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum number of days required to water the trees so they grow to the same height.\n\nYou have to answer $ t $ independent test cases.",
