    "description": "Gena loves sequences of numbers. Recently, he has discovered a new type of sequences which he called an almost arithmetical progression. A sequence is an almost arithmetical progression, if its elements can be represented as:\n\n- $ a_{1}=p $ , where $ p $ is some integer;\n- $ a_{i}=a_{i-1}+(-1)^{i+1}\u00b7q $ $ (i&gt;1) $ , where $ q $ is some integer.\n\nRight now Gena has a piece of paper with sequence $ b $ , consisting of $ n $ integers. Help Gena, find there the longest subsequence of integers that is an almost arithmetical progression.\n\nSequence $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{k} $ is a subsequence of sequence $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ , if there is such increasing sequence of indexes $ i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{k} $ $ (1<=i_{1}&lt;i_{2}&lt;...\\ &lt;i_{k}<=n) $ , that $ b_{ij}=s_{j} $ . In other words, sequence $ s $ can be obtained from $ b $ by crossing out some elements.",
