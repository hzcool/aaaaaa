But when you saw how messy the bookshelf was you decided to clean it up first.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1481E/eb717b77908d0758f813f3cb2f376ac8a23aad06.png)There are $ n $ books standing in a row on the shelf, the $ i $ -th book has color $ a_i $ .\n\nYou'd like to rearrange the books to make the shelf look beautiful. The shelf is considered beautiful if all books of the same color are next to each other.\n\nIn one operation you can take one book from any position on the shelf and move it to the right end of the shelf.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of operations you need to make the shelf beautiful?",
