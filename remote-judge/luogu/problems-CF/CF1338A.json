For every positive integer $ x $ you are going to perform the following operation during the $ x $ -th second:\n\n- Select some distinct indices $ i_{1}, i_{2}, \\ldots, i_{k} $ which are between $ 1 $ and $ n $ inclusive, and add $ 2^{x-1} $ to each corresponding position of $ a $ . Formally, $ a_{i_{j}} := a_{i_{j}} + 2^{x-1} $ for $ j = 1, 2, \\ldots, k $ . Note that you are allowed to not select any indices at all.\n\nYou have to make $ a $ nondecreasing as fast as possible. Find the smallest number $ T $ such that you can make the array nondecreasing after at most $ T $ seconds.\n\nArray $ a $ is nondecreasing if and only if $ a_{1} \\le a_{2} \\le \\ldots \\le a_{n} $ .\n\nYou have to answer $ t $ independent test cases.",
