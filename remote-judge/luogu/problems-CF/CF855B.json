    "description": "Professor Dumbledore is helping Harry destroy the Horcruxes. He went to Gaunt Shack as he suspected a Horcrux to be present there. He saw Marvolo Gaunt's Ring and identified it as a Horcrux. Although he destroyed it, he is still affected by its curse. Professor Snape is helping Dumbledore remove the curse. For this, he wants to give Dumbledore exactly $ x $ drops of the potion he made.\n\nValue of $ x $ is calculated as maximum of $ p\u00b7a_{i}+q\u00b7a_{j}+r\u00b7a_{k} $ for given $ p,q,r $ and array $ a_{1},a_{2},...\\ a_{n} $ such that $ 1<=i<=j<=k<=n $ . Help Snape find the value of $ x $ . Do note that the value of $ x $ may be negative.",
