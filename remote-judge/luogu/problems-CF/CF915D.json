    "description": "You are given a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph) consisting of $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.\n\nCan you make this graph [acyclic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2<=n<=500 $ , $ 1<=m<=min(n(n-1),100000) $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.\n\nThen $ m $ lines follow. Each line contains two integers $ u $ and $ v $ denoting a directed edge going from vertex $ u $ to vertex $ v $ ( $ 1<=u,v<=n $ , $ u\u2260v $ ). Each ordered pair $ (u,v) $ is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from $ u $ to $ v $ ).",
