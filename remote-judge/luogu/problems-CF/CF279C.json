    "description": "You've got an array, consisting of $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . Also, you've got $ m $ queries, the $ i $ -th query is described by two integers $ l_{i},r_{i} $ . Numbers $ l_{i},r_{i} $ define a subsegment of the original array, that is, the sequence of numbers $ a_{li},a_{li}+1,a_{li}+2,...,a_{ri} $ . For each query you should check whether the corresponding segment is a ladder.\n\nA ladder is a sequence of integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{k} $ , such that it first doesn't decrease, then doesn't increase. In other words, there is such integer $ x $ $ (1<=x<=k) $ , that the following inequation fulfills: $ b_{1}<=b_{2}<=...<=b_{x}>=b_{x+1}>=b_{x+2}...>=b_{k} $ . Note that the non-decreasing and the non-increasing sequences are also considered ladders.",

The second line contains the sequence of integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ), where number $ a_{i} $ stands for the $ i $ -th array element.\n\nThe following $ m $ lines contain the description of the queries. The $ i $ -th line contains the description of the $ i $ -th query, consisting of two integers $ l_{i} $ , $ r_{i} $ $ (1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=n) $ \u2014 the boundaries of the subsegment of the initial array.\n\nThe numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.",
