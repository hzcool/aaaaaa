    "description": "For the New Year, Polycarp decided to send postcards to all his $ n $ friends. He wants to make postcards with his own hands. For this purpose, he has a sheet of paper of size $ w \\times h $ , which can be cut into pieces.\n\nPolycarp can cut any sheet of paper $ w \\times h $ that he has in only two cases:\n\n- If $ w $ is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size $ \\frac{w}{2} \\times h $ ;\n- If $ h $ is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size $ w \\times \\frac{h}{2} $ ;\n\nIf $ w $ and $ h $ are even at the same time, then Polycarp can cut the sheet according to any of the rules above.\n\nAfter cutting a sheet of paper, the total number of sheets of paper is increased by $ 1 $ .\n\nHelp Polycarp to find out if he can cut his sheet of size $ w \\times h $ at into $ n $ or more pieces, using only the rules described above.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers $ w $ , $ h $ , $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le w, h \\le 10^4, 1 \\le n \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the width and height of the sheet Polycarp has and the number of friends he needs to send a postcard to.",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, output on a separate line:\n\n- \"YES\", if it is possible to cut a sheet of size $ w \\times h $ into at least $ n $ pieces;\n- \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).",

    "hint": "In the first test case, you can first cut the $ 2 \\times 2 $ sheet into two $ 2 \\times 1 $ sheets, and then cut each of them into two more sheets. As a result, we get four sheets $ 1 \\times 1 $ . We can choose any three of them and send them to our friends.\n\nIn the second test case, a $ 3 \\times 3 $ sheet cannot be cut, so it is impossible to get two sheets.\n\nIn the third test case, you can cut a $ 5 \\times 10 $ sheet into two $ 5 \\times 5 $ sheets.\n\nIn the fourth test case, there is no need to cut the sheet, since we only need one sheet.\n\nIn the fifth test case, you can first cut the $ 1 \\times 4 $ sheet into two $ 1 \\times 2 $ sheets, and then cut each of them into two more sheets. As a result, we get four sheets $ 1 \\times 1 $ .",
