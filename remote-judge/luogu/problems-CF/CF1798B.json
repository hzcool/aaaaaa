    "description": "Lottery \"Three Sevens\" was held for $ m $ days. On day $ i $ , $ n_i $ people with the numbers $ a_{i, 1}, \\ldots, a_{i, n_i} $ participated in the lottery.\n\nIt is known that in each of the $ m $ days, only one winner was selected from the lottery participants. The lottery winner on day $ i $ was not allowed to participate in the lottery in the days from $ i+1 $ to $ m $ .\n\nUnfortunately, the information about the lottery winners has been lost. You need to find any possible list of lottery winners on days from $ 1 $ to $ m $ or determine that no solution exists.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 50\\,000 $ ). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ m $ ( $ 1 \\le m \\le 50\\,000 $ ) \u2014 the number of days in which the lottery was held.\n\nNext, for each $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ m $ , follows a two-line block of data.\n\nThe first line of each block contains a single integer $ n_i $ ( $ 1 \\le n_i \\le 50\\,000 $ ) \u2014 the number of lottery participants on day $ i $ .\n\nThe second line of the block contains integers $ a_{i, 1}, \\ldots, a_{i, n_i} $ ( $ 1 \\le a_{i, j} \\le 50\\,000 $ ) \u2014 lottery participants on day $ i $ . It is guaranteed that all the numbers $ a_{i, 1}, \\ldots, a_{i, n_i} $ are pairwise distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n_i $ over all blocks of all test cases does not exceed $ 50\\,000 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there is no solution, print a single integer $ -1 $ .\n\nOtherwise, print $ m $ integers $ p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_m $ ( $ 1 \\le p_i \\le 50\\,000 $ ) \u2014 lottery winners on days from $ 1 $ to $ m $ . If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",

    "hint": "In the first test case, one of the answers is $ [8, 2, 1] $ since the participant with the number $ 8 $ participated on day $ 1 $ , but did not participate on days $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ ; the participant with the number $ 2 $ participated on day $ 2 $ , but did not participate on day $ 3 $ ; and the participant with the number $ 1 $ participated on day $ 3 $ . Note that this is not the only possible answer, for example, $ [8, 9, 4] $ is also a correct answer.\n\nIn the second test case, both lottery participants participated on both days, so any possible lottery winner on the day $ 1 $ must have participated on the day $ 2 $ , which is not allowed. Thus, there is no correct answer.\n\nIn the third test case, only one participant participated on days $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 4 $ , and on day $ 1 $ there is only one participant who did not participate in the lottery on days $ 2, 3, 4 $ \u2014 participant $ 2 $ , which means $ [2, 1, 4, 3] $ is the only correct answer to this test case.",
