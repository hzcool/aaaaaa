    "description": "In fact, the problems E1 and E2 do not have much in common. You should probably think of them as two separate problems.\n\nYou are given an integer array $ a[1 \\ldots n] = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n] $ .\n\nLet us consider an empty [deque](https://tinyurl.com/pfeucbux) (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements $ [3, 4, 4] $ currently in the deque, adding an element $ 1 $ to the beginning will produce the sequence $ [\\color{red}{1}, 3, 4, 4] $ , and adding the same element to the end will produce $ [3, 4, 4, \\color{red}{1}] $ .\n\nThe elements of the array are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with $ a_1 $ and finishing with $ a_n $ . Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end.\n\nFor example, if we consider an array $ a = [3, 7, 5, 5] $ , one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this:\n\n $ \\quad $ 1.add $ 3 $ to the beginning of the deque:deque has a sequence $ [\\color{red}{3}] $ in it; $ \\quad $ 2.add $ 7 $ to the end of the deque:deque has a sequence $ [3, \\color{red}{7}] $ in it; $ \\quad $ 3.add $ 5 $ to the end of the deque:deque has a sequence $ [3, 7, \\color{red}{5}] $ in it; $ \\quad $ 4.add $ 5 $ to the beginning of the deque:deque has a sequence $ [\\color{red}{5}, 3, 7, 5] $ in it;Find the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed.\n\nAn inversion in sequence $ d $ is a pair of indices $ (i, j) $ such that $ i < j $ and $ d_i > d_j $ . For example, the array $ d = [5, 3, 7, 5] $ has exactly two inversions \u2014 $ (1, 2) $ and $ (3, 4) $ , since $ d_1 = 5 > 3 = d_2 $ and $ d_3 = 7 > 5 = d_4 $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next $ 2t $ lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 array size. The second line of the description contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_i $ ( $ -10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",

In this case, the original sequence $ [3, 7, 5, 5] $ , also containing exactly two inversions, will be in the deque as-is.",
