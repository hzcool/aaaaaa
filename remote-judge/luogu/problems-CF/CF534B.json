    "description": "The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals $ v_{1} $ meters per second, and in the end it is $ v_{2} $ meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly $ t $ seconds to pass.\n\nAssuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by $ d $ meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed $ d $ in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ v_{1} $ and $ v_{2} $ ( $ 1<=v_{1},v_{2}<=100 $ ) \u2014 the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains two integers $ t $ ( $ 2<=t<=100 $ ) \u2014 the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, $ d $  $ (0<=d<=10) $  \u2014 the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:\n\n- the speed in the first second equals $ v_{1} $ ,\n- the speed in the last second equals $ v_{2} $ ,\n- the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed $ d $ .",
