    "description": "Dmitry has $ n $ segments of different colors on the coordinate axis $ Ox $ . Each segment is characterized by three integers $ l_i $ , $ r_i $ and $ c_i $ ( $ 1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le 10^9, 1 \\le c_i \\le n $ ), where $ l_i $ and $ r_i $ are are the coordinates of the ends of the $ i $ -th segment, and $ c_i $ is its color.\n\nDmitry likes to find the minimum distances between segments. However, he considers pairs of segments of the same color uninteresting. Therefore, he wants to know for each segment the distance from this segment to the nearest differently colored segment.\n\nThe distance between two segments is the minimum of the distances between a point of the first segment and a point of the second segment. In particular, if the segments intersect, then the distance between them is equal to $ 0 $ .\n\nFor example, Dmitry has $ 5 $ segments:\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1741F/79204e7473b447d8fc1f451b9209c375a1af681c.png)- The first segment intersects with the second (and these are segments of different colors), so the answers for them are equal to $ 0 $ .\n- For the $ 3 $ -rd segment, the nearest segment of a different color is the $ 2 $ -nd segment, the distance to which is equal to $ 2 $ .\n- For the $ 4 $ -th segment, the nearest segment of a different color is the $ 5 $ -th segment, the distance to which is equal to $ 1 $ .\n- The $ 5 $ -th segment lies inside the $ 2 $ -nd segment (and these are segments of different colors), so the answers for them are equal to $ 0 $ .",
