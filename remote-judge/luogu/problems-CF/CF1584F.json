In addition, it's guaranteed that each character occurs in each string at most twice. Find the longest common subsequence of these strings.\n\nA string $ t $ is a subsequence of a string $ s $ if $ t $ can be obtained from $ s $ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) symbols.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 5 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 10 $ ) \u2014 the number of strings.\n\nEach of the next $ n $ lines contains the corresponding string $ s_i $ . Each $ s_i $ is non-empty, consists only of uppercase and lowercase English letters, and no character appears more than twice in each string.",
