    "description": "A tree is a connected undirected graph consisting of $ n $ vertices and $ n-1 $ edges. Vertices are numbered $ 1 $ through $ n $ .\n\nLimak is a little polar bear. He once had a tree with $ n $ vertices but he lost it. He still remembers something about the lost tree though.\n\nYou are given $ m $ pairs of vertices $ (a_{1},b_{1}),(a_{2},b_{2}),...,(a_{m},b_{m}) $ . Limak remembers that for each $ i $ there was no edge between $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ . He also remembers that vertex $ 1 $ was incident to exactly $ k $ edges (its degree was equal to $ k $ ).\n\nIs it possible that Limak remembers everything correctly? Check whether there exists a tree satisfying the given conditions.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ k $ (![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF653E/c397b4548a4ab37dd7d160c3cf4973cb7d9aa698.png)) \u2014 the number of vertices in Limak's tree, the number of forbidden pairs of vertices, and the degree of vertex $ 1 $ , respectively.\n\nThe $ i $ -th of next $ m $ lines contains two distinct integers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n,a_{i}\u2260b_{i} $ ) \u2014 the $ i $ -th pair that is forbidden. It's guaranteed that each pair of vertices will appear at most once in the input.",

All conditions are satisfied for a tree with edges $ 1-5 $ , $ 5-2 $ , $ 1-3 $ and $ 3-4 $ .\n\nIn the second sample, Limak remembers that none of the following edges existed: $ 1-2 $ , $ 1-3 $ , $ 1-4 $ , $ 1-5 $ and $ 1-6 $ . Hence, vertex $ 1 $ couldn't be connected to any other vertex and it implies that there is no suitable tree.",
