    "description": "Ivan has got an array of $ n $ non-negative integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . Ivan knows that the array is sorted in the non-decreasing order.\n\nIvan wrote out integers $ 2^{a_{1}},2^{a_{2}},...,2^{a_{n}} $ on a piece of paper. Now he wonders, what minimum number of integers of form $ 2^{b} $ $ (b>=0) $ need to be added to the piece of paper so that the sum of all integers written on the paper equalled $ 2^{v}-1 $ for some integer $ v $ $ (v>=0) $ .\n\nHelp Ivan, find the required quantity of numbers.",
