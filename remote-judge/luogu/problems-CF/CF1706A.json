You can replace the character at any position multiple times through the operations.\n\nFind the lexicographically smallest string you can get after these operations.\n\nA string $ x $ is lexicographically smaller than a string $ y $ of the same length if and only if in the first position where $ x $ and $ y $ differ, the string $ x $ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $ y $ .",

    "hint": "In the first test case, the sequence $ a = [1, 1, 3, 1] $ . One of the possible solutions is the following.\n\n- At the $ 1 $ -st operation, you can replace the $ 1 $ -st character of $ s $ with A. After it, $ s $ becomes ABBBB.\n- At the $ 2 $ -nd operation, you can replace the $ 5 $ -th character of $ s $ with A (since $ m+1-a_2=5 $ ). After it, $ s $ becomes ABBBA.\n- At the $ 3 $ -rd operation, you can replace the $ 3 $ -rd character of $ s $ with A. After it, $ s $ becomes ABABA.\n- At the $ 4 $ -th operation, you can replace the $ 1 $ -st character of $ s $ with A. After it, $ s $ remains equal to ABABA.\n\n The resulting string is ABABA. It is impossible to produce a lexicographically smaller string.In the second test case, you are going to perform only one operation. You can replace either the $ 2 $ -nd character or $ 4 $ -th character of $ s $ with A. You can get strings BABBB and BBBAB after the operation. The string BABBB is the lexicographically smallest among these strings.\n\nIn the third test case, the only string you can get is A.\n\nIn the fourth test case, you can replace the $ 1 $ -st and $ 2 $ -nd characters of $ s $ with A to get AABB.\n\nIn the fifth test case, you can replace the $ 1 $ -st and $ 3 $ -rd characters of $ s $ with A to get ABABBBB.",
