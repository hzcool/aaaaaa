    "description": "Amr has got a large array of size $ n $ . Amr doesn't like large arrays so he intends to make it smaller.\n\nAmr doesn't care about anything in the array except the beauty of it. The beauty of the array is defined to be the maximum number of times that some number occurs in this array. He wants to choose the smallest subsegment of this array such that the beauty of it will be the same as the original array.\n\nHelp Amr by choosing the smallest subsegment possible.",

    "outputFormat": "Output two integers $ l,r $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ ), the beginning and the end of the subsegment chosen respectively.\n\nIf there are several possible answers you may output any of them.",
