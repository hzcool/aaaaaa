    "description": "You've gotten an $ n\u00d7m $ sheet of squared paper. Some of its squares are painted. Let's mark the set of all painted squares as $ A $ . Set $ A $ is connected. Your task is to find the minimum number of squares that we can delete from set $ A $ to make it not connected.\n\nA set of painted squares is called connected, if for every two squares $ a $ and $ b $ from this set there is a sequence of squares from the set, beginning in $ a $ and ending in $ b $ , such that in this sequence any square, except for the last one, shares a common side with the square that follows next in the sequence. An empty set and a set consisting of exactly one square are connected by definition.",
    "inputFormat": "The first input line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=50 $ ) \u2014 the sizes of the sheet of paper.\n\nEach of the next $ n $ lines contains $ m $ characters \u2014 the description of the sheet of paper: the $ j $ -th character of the $ i $ -th line equals either \"#\", if the corresponding square is painted (belongs to set $ A $ ), or equals \".\" if the corresponding square is not painted (does not belong to set $ A $ ). It is guaranteed that the set of all painted squares $ A $ is connected and isn't empty.",
    "outputFormat": "On the first line print the minimum number of squares that need to be deleted to make set $ A $ not connected. If it is impossible, print -1.",
