    "description": "Colossal! \u2014 exclaimed Hawk-nose. \u2014 A programmer! That's exactly what we are looking for.\n\nArkadi and Boris Strugatsky. Monday starts on Saturday\n\n\n\nReading the book \"Equations of Mathematical Magic\" Roman Oira-Oira and Cristobal Junta found an interesting equation: $ a - (a \\oplus x) - x = 0 $ for some given $ a $ , where $ \\oplus $ stands for a bitwise exclusive or (XOR) of two integers (this operation is denoted as ^ or xor in many modern programming languages). Oira-Oira quickly found some $ x $ , which is the solution of the equation, but Cristobal Junta decided that Oira-Oira's result is not interesting enough, so he asked his colleague how many non-negative solutions of this equation exist. This task turned out to be too difficult for Oira-Oira, so he asks you to help.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains several possible values of $ a $ and your task is to find the number of equation's solution for each of them. The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of these values.\n\nThe following $ t $ lines contain the values of parameter $ a $ , each value is an integer from $ 0 $ to $ 2^{30} - 1 $ inclusive.",
    "outputFormat": "For each value of $ a $ print exactly one integer \u2014 the number of non-negative solutions of the equation for the given value of the parameter. Print answers in the same order as values of $ a $ appear in the input.\n\nOne can show that the number of solutions is always finite.",

    "hint": "Let's define the bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation. Given two integers $ x $ and $ y $ , consider their binary representations (possibly with leading zeroes): $ x_k \\dots x_2 x_1 x_0 $ and $ y_k \\dots y_2 y_1 y_0 $ . Here, $ x_i $ is the $ i $ -th bit of the number $ x $ and $ y_i $ is the $ i $ -th bit of the number $ y $ . Let $ r = x \\oplus y $ be the result of the XOR operation of $ x $ and $ y $ . Then $ r $ is defined as $ r_k \\dots r_2 r_1 r_0 $ where:\n\n $ $$$ r_i = \\left\\{ \\begin{aligned} 1, ~ \\text{if} ~ x_i \\ne y_i \\\\ 0, ~ \\text{if} ~ x_i = y_i \\end{aligned} \\right.  $ $ </p><p>For the first value of the parameter, only  $ x = 0 $  is a solution of the equation.</p><p>For the second value of the parameter, solutions are  $ x = 0 $  and  $ x = 2$$$.",
