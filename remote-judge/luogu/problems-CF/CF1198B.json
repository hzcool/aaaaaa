    "description": "There is a country with $ n $ citizens. The $ i $ -th of them initially has $ a_{i} $ money. The government strictly controls the wealth of its citizens. Whenever a citizen makes a purchase or earns some money, they must send a receipt to the social services mentioning the amount of money they currently have.\n\nSometimes the government makes payouts to the poor: all citizens who have strictly less money than $ x $ are paid accordingly so that after the payout they have exactly $ x $ money. In this case the citizens don't send a receipt.\n\nYou know the initial wealth of every citizen and the log of all events: receipts and payouts. Restore the amount of money each citizen has after all events.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^{5} $ ) \u2014 the numer of citizens.\n\nThe next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1 $ , $ a_2 $ , ..., $ a_n $ ( $ 0 \\le a_{i} \\le 10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the initial balances of citizens.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of events.\n\nEach of the next $ q $ lines contains a single event. The events are given in chronological order.\n\nEach event is described as either 1 p x ( $ 1 \\le p \\le n $ , $ 0 \\le x \\le 10^{9} $ ), or 2 x ( $ 0 \\le x \\le 10^{9} $ ). In the first case we have a receipt that the balance of the $ p $ -th person becomes equal to $ x $ . In the second case we have a payoff with parameter $ x $ .",
