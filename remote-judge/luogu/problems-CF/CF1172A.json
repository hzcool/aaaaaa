    "description": "Nauuo is a girl who loves playing cards.\n\nOne day she was playing cards but found that the cards were mixed with some empty ones.\n\nThere are $ n $ cards numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , and they were mixed with another $ n $ empty cards. She piled up the $ 2n $ cards and drew $ n $ of them. The $ n $ cards in Nauuo's hands are given. The remaining $ n $ cards in the pile are also given in the order from top to bottom.\n\nIn one operation she can choose a card in her hands and play it \u2014 put it at the bottom of the pile, then draw the top card from the pile.\n\nNauuo wants to make the $ n $ numbered cards piled up in increasing order (the $ i $ -th card in the pile from top to bottom is the card $ i $ ) as quickly as possible. Can you tell her the minimum number of operations?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of numbered cards.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n $ ( $ 0\\le a_i\\le n $ ) \u2014 the initial cards in Nauuo's hands. $ 0 $ represents an empty card.\n\nThe third line contains $ n $ integers $ b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_n $ ( $ 0\\le b_i\\le n $ ) \u2014 the initial cards in the pile, given in order from top to bottom. $ 0 $ represents an empty card.\n\nIt is guaranteed that each number from $ 1 $ to $ n $ appears exactly once, either in $ a_{1..n} $ or $ b_{1..n} $ .",
