    "description": "Heidi has finally found the mythical Tree of Life \u2013 a legendary combinatorial structure which is said to contain a prophecy crucially needed to defeat the undead armies.\n\nOn the surface, the Tree of Life is just a regular undirected tree well-known from computer science. This means that it is a collection of $ n $ points (called vertices), some of which are connected using $ n-1 $ line segments (edges) so that each pair of vertices is connected by a path (a sequence of one or more edges).\n\nTo decipher the prophecy, Heidi needs to perform a number of steps. The first is counting the number of lifelines in the tree \u2013 these are paths of length $ 2 $ , i.e., consisting of two edges. Help her!",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ \u2013 the number of vertices in the tree ( $ 1<=n<=10000 $ ). The vertices are labeled with the numbers from 1 to $ n $ . Then $ n-1 $ lines follow, each describing one edge using two space-separated numbers $ a\u2002b $ \u2013 the labels of the vertices connected by the edge ( $ 1<=a<b<=n $ ). It is guaranteed that the input represents a tree.",
