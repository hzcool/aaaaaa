    "description": "Petya and Vasya are playing a game. Petya's got $ n $ non-transparent glasses, standing in a row. The glasses' positions are indexed with integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from left to right. Note that the positions are indexed but the glasses are not.\n\nFirst Petya puts a marble under the glass in position $ s $ . Then he performs some (possibly zero) shuffling operations. One shuffling operation means moving the glass from the first position to position $ p_{1} $ , the glass from the second position to position $ p_{2} $ and so on. That is, a glass goes from position $ i $ to position $ p_{i} $ . Consider all glasses are moving simultaneously during one shuffling operation. When the glasses are shuffled, the marble doesn't travel from one glass to another: it moves together with the glass it was initially been put in.\n\nAfter all shuffling operations Petya shows Vasya that the ball has moved to position $ t $ . Vasya's task is to say what minimum number of shuffling operations Petya has performed or determine that Petya has made a mistake and the marble could not have got from position $ s $ to position $ t $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers: $ n,s,t\\ (1<=n<=10^{5};\u00a01<=s,t<=n) $ \u2014 the number of glasses, the ball's initial and final position. The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers: $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n}\\ (1<=p_{i}<=n) $ \u2014 the shuffling operation parameters. It is guaranteed that all $ p_{i} $ 's are distinct.\n\nNote that $ s $ can equal $ t $ .",
    "outputFormat": "If the marble can move from position $ s $ to position $ t $ , then print on a single line a non-negative integer \u2014 the minimum number of shuffling operations, needed to get the marble to position $ t $ . If it is impossible, print number -1.",
