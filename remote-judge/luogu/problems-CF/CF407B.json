    "description": "One day, little Vasya found himself in a maze consisting of $ (n+1) $ rooms, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ (n+1) $ . Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out of the maze, he needs to get to the $ (n+1) $ -th one.\n\nThe maze is organized as follows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let's consider room number $ i $ $ (1<=i<=n) $ , someone can use the first portal to move from it to room number $ (i+1) $ , also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room number $ p_{i} $ , where $ 1<=p_{i}<=i $ .\n\nIn order not to get lost, Vasya decided to act as follows.\n\n- Each time Vasya enters some room, he paints a cross on its ceiling. Initially, Vasya paints a cross at the ceiling of room $ 1 $ .\n- Let's assume that Vasya is in room $ i $ and has already painted a cross on its ceiling. Then, if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses, Vasya uses the second portal (it leads to room $ p_{i} $ ), otherwise Vasya uses the first portal.\n\nHelp Vasya determine the number of times he needs to use portals to get to room $ (n+1) $ in the end.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{3} $ ) \u2014 the number of rooms. The second line contains $ n $ integers $ p_{i} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i}<=i $ ). Each $ p_{i} $ denotes the number of the room, that someone can reach, if he will use the second portal in the $ i $ -th room.",
    "outputFormat": "Print a single number \u2014 the number of portal moves the boy needs to go out of the maze. As the number can be rather large, print it modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .",
