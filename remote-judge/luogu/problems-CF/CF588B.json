    "description": "Duff is in love with lovely numbers! A positive integer $ x $ is called lovely if and only if there is no such positive integer $ a&gt;1 $ such that $ a^{2} $ is a divisor of $ x $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF588B/6cb6ec7affd84969580e6e68f10fadbba60cec18.png)Malek has a number store! In his store, he has only divisors of positive integer $ n $ (and he has all of them). As a birthday present, Malek wants to give her a lovely number from his store. He wants this number to be as big as possible.\n\nMalek always had issues in math, so he asked for your help. Please tell him what is the biggest lovely number in his store.",

    "hint": "In first sample case, there are numbers 1, 2, 5 and 10 in the shop. 10 isn't divisible by any perfect square, so 10 is lovely.\n\nIn second sample case, there are numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 in the shop. 12 is divisible by $ 4=2^{2} $ , so 12 is not lovely, while 6 is indeed lovely.",
