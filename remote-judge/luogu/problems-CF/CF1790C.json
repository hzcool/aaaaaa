    "description": "A sequence of $ n $ numbers is called permutation if it contains all integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ exactly once. For example, the sequences \\[ $ 3, 1, 4, 2 $ \\], \\[ $ 1 $ \\] and \\[ $ 2,1 $ \\] are permutations, but \\[ $ 1,2,1 $ \\], \\[ $ 0,1 $ \\] and \\[ $ 1,3,4 $ \\] \u2014 are not.\n\nKristina had a permutation $ p $ of $ n $ elements. She wrote it on the whiteboard $ n $ times in such a way that:\n\n- while writing the permutation at the $ i $ -th ( $ 1 \\le i \\le n) $ time she skipped the element $ p_i $\n\n So, she wrote in total $ n $ sequences of length $ n-1 $ each.For example, suppose Kristina had a permutation $ p $ = $ [4,2,1,3] $ of length $ 4 $ . Then she did the following:\n\n1. Wrote the sequence $ [2, 1, 3] $ , skipping the element $ p_1=4 $ from the original permutation.\n2. Wrote the sequence $ [4, 1, 3] $ , skipping the element $ p_2=2 $ from the original permutation.\n3. Wrote the sequence $ [4, 2, 3] $ , skipping the element $ p_3=1 $ from the original permutation.\n4. Wrote the sequence $ [4, 2, 1] $ , skipping the element $ p_4=3 $ from the original permutation.\n\nYou know all $ n $ of sequences that have been written on the whiteboard, but you do not know the order in which they were written. They are given in arbitrary order. Reconstruct the original permutation from them.\n\nFor example, if you know the sequences $ [4, 2, 1] $ , $ [4, 2, 3] $ , $ [2, 1, 3] $ , $ [4, 1, 3] $ , then the original permutation will be $ p $ = $ [4, 2, 1, 3] $ .",
