    "description": "You are given a rectangular grid of lattice points from $ (0,0) $ to $ (n,m) $ inclusive. You have to choose exactly 4 different points to build a polyline possibly with self-intersections and self-touching. This polyline should be as long as possible.\n\nA polyline defined by points $ p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4} $ consists of the line segments $ p_{1}p_{2},p_{2}p_{3},p_{3}p_{4} $ , and its length is the sum of the lengths of the individual line segments.",
    "inputFormat": "The only line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ $ (0<=n,m<=1000) $ . It is guaranteed that grid contains at least 4 different points.",
    "outputFormat": "Print 4 lines with two integers per line separated by space \u2014 coordinates of points $ p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4} $ in order which represent the longest possible polyline.\n\nJudge program compares your answer and jury's answer with $ 10^{-6} $ precision.",
