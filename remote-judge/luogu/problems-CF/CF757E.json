    "description": "Bash got tired on his journey to become the greatest Pokemon master. So he decides to take a break and play with functions.\n\nBash defines a function $ f_{0}(n) $ , which denotes the number of ways of factoring $ n $ into two factors $ p $ and $ q $ such that $ gcd(p,q)=1 $ . In other words, $ f_{0}(n) $ is the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $ (p,q) $ such that $ p\u00b7q=n $ and $ gcd(p,q)=1 $ .\n\nBut Bash felt that it was too easy to calculate this function. So he defined a series of functions, where $ f_{r+1} $ is defined as:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF757E/ba3f455e23406140b1481185211a534c2e0f9d49.png)Where $ (u,v) $ is any ordered pair of positive integers, they need not to be co-prime.\n\nNow Bash wants to know the value of $ f_{r}(n) $ for different $ r $ and $ n $ . Since the value could be huge, he would like to know the value modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ . Help him!",
