    "description": "Paul hates palindromes. He assumes that string $ s $ is tolerable if each its character is one of the first $ p $ letters of the English alphabet and $ s $ doesn't contain any palindrome contiguous substring of length 2 or more.\n\nPaul has found a tolerable string $ s $ of length $ n $ . Help him find the lexicographically next tolerable string of the same length or else state that such string does not exist.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two space-separated integers: $ n $ and $ p $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ ; $ 1<=p<=26 $ ). The second line contains string $ s $ , consisting of $ n $ small English letters. It is guaranteed that the string is tolerable (according to the above definition).",
    "outputFormat": "If the lexicographically next tolerable string of the same length exists, print it. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without the quotes).",
