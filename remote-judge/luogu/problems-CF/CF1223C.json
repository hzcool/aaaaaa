    "description": "You are an environmental activist at heart but the reality is harsh and you are just a cashier in a cinema. But you can still do something!\n\nYou have $ n $ tickets to sell. The price of the $ i $ -th ticket is $ p_i $ . As a teller, you have a possibility to select the order in which the tickets will be sold (i.e. a permutation of the tickets). You know that the cinema participates in two ecological restoration programs applying them to the order you chose:\n\n- The $ x\\% $ of the price of each the $ a $ -th sold ticket ( $ a $ -th, $ 2a $ -th, $ 3a $ -th and so on) in the order you chose is aimed for research and spreading of renewable energy sources.\n- The $ y\\% $ of the price of each the $ b $ -th sold ticket ( $ b $ -th, $ 2b $ -th, $ 3b $ -th and so on) in the order you chose is aimed for pollution abatement.\n\nIf the ticket is in both programs then the $ (x + y) \\% $ are used for environmental activities. Also, it's known that all prices are multiples of $ 100 $ , so there is no need in any rounding.\n\nFor example, if you'd like to sell tickets with prices $ [400, 100, 300, 200] $ and the cinema pays $ 10\\% $ of each $ 2 $ -nd sold ticket and $ 20\\% $ of each $ 3 $ -rd sold ticket, then arranging them in order $ [100, 200, 300, 400] $ will lead to contribution equal to $ 100 \\cdot 0 + 200 \\cdot 0.1 + 300 \\cdot 0.2 + 400 \\cdot 0.1 = 120 $ . But arranging them in order $ [100, 300, 400, 200] $ will lead to $ 100 \\cdot 0 + 300 \\cdot 0.1 + 400 \\cdot 0.2 + 200 \\cdot 0.1 = 130 $ .\n\nNature can't wait, so you decided to change the order of tickets in such a way, so that the total contribution to programs will reach at least $ k $ in minimum number of sold tickets. Or say that it's impossible to do so. In other words, find the minimum number of tickets which are needed to be sold in order to earn at least $ k $ .",

Each query consists of $ 5 $ lines.\n\nThe first line of each query contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of tickets.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n $ ( $ 100 \\le p_i \\le 10^9 $ , $ p_i \\bmod 100 = 0 $ ) \u2014 the corresponding prices of tickets.\n\nThe third line contains two integers $ x $ and $ a $ ( $ 1 \\le x \\le 100 $ , $ x + y \\le 100 $ , $ 1 \\le a \\le n $ ) \u2014 the parameters of the first program.\n\nThe fourth line contains two integers $ y $ and $ b $ ( $ 1 \\le y \\le 100 $ , $ x + y \\le 100 $ , $ 1 \\le b \\le n $ ) \u2014 the parameters of the second program.\n\nThe fifth line contains single integer $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le k \\le 10^{14} $ ) \u2014 the required total contribution.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the total number of tickets per test doesn't exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
