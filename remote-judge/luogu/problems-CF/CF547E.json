What is double strange that a phone number can be associated with several bears!\n\nIn that country there is a rock band called CF consisting of $ n $ bears (including Mike) numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF547E/795f636f6e5e68bda106d7b6f30ea579c783740e.png)Phone number of $ i $ -th member of CF is $ s_{i} $ . May 17th is a holiday named Phone Calls day. In the last Phone Calls day, everyone called all the numbers that are substrings of his/her number (one may call some number several times). In particular, everyone called himself (that was really strange country).\n\nDenote as $ call(i,j) $ the number of times that $ i $ -th member of CF called the $ j $ -th member of CF.\n\nThe geek Mike has $ q $ questions that he wants to ask you. In each question he gives you numbers $ l,r $ and $ k $ and you should tell him the number\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF547E/a85d82cd6a7515cf5b34f6817bb4ac822d627734.png)",
