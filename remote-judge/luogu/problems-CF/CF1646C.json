    "description": "A number is called powerful if it is a power of two or a factorial. In other words, the number $ m $ is powerful if there exists a non-negative integer $ d $ such that $ m=2^d $ or $ m=d! $ , where $ d!=1\\cdot 2\\cdot \\ldots \\cdot d $ (in particular, $ 0! = 1 $ ). For example $ 1 $ , $ 4 $ , and $ 6 $ are powerful numbers, because $ 1=1! $ , $ 4=2^2 $ , and $ 6=3! $ but $ 7 $ , $ 10 $ , or $ 18 $ are not.\n\nYou are given a positive integer $ n $ . Find the minimum number $ k $ such that $ n $ can be represented as the sum of $ k $ distinct powerful numbers, or say that there is no such $ k $ .",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 100 $ ). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nA test case consists of only one line, containing one integer $ n $ ( $ 1\\le n\\le 10^{12} $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case print the answer on a separate line.\n\nIf $ n $ can not be represented as the sum of distinct powerful numbers, print $ -1 $ .\n\nOtherwise, print a single positive integer \u2014 the minimum possible value of $ k $ .",

        ]
    ],
    "hint": "In the first test case, $ 7 $ can be represented as $ 7=1+6 $ , where $ 1 $ and $ 6 $ are powerful numbers. Because $ 7 $ is not a powerful number, we know that the minimum possible value of $ k $ in this case is $ k=2 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, a possible way to represent $ 11 $ as the sum of three powerful numbers is $ 11=1+4+6 $ . We can show that there is no way to represent $ 11 $ as the sum of two or less powerful numbers.\n\nIn the third test case, $ 240 $ can be represented as $ 240=24+32+64+120 $ . Observe that $ 240=120+120 $ is not a valid representation, because the powerful numbers have to be distinct.\n\nIn the fourth test case, $ 17179869184=2^{34} $ , so $ 17179869184 $ is a powerful number and the minimum $ k $ in this case is $ k=1 $ .",
