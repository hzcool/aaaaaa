    "description": "You are given two lists of non-zero digits.\n\nLet's call an integer pretty if its (base $ 10 $ ) representation has at least one digit from the first list and at least one digit from the second list. What is the smallest positive pretty integer?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=9 $ ) \u2014 the lengths of the first and the second lists, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ distinct digits $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=9 $ ) \u2014 the elements of the first list.\n\nThe third line contains $ m $ distinct digits $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{m} $ ( $ 1<=b_{i}<=9 $ ) \u2014 the elements of the second list.",

    "hint": "In the first example $ 25 $ , $ 46 $ , $ 24567 $ are pretty, as well as many other integers. The smallest among them is $ 25 $ . $ 42 $ and $ 24 $ are not pretty because they don't have digits from the second list.\n\nIn the second example all integers that have at least one digit different from $ 9 $ are pretty. It's obvious that the smallest among them is $ 1 $ , because it's the smallest positive integer.",
