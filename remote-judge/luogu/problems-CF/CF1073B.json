    "description": "Vasya has got $ n $ books, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , arranged in a stack. The topmost book has number $ a_1 $ , the next one \u2014 $ a_2 $ , and so on. The book at the bottom of the stack has number $ a_n $ . All numbers are distinct.\n\nVasya wants to move all the books to his backpack in $ n $ steps. During $ i $ -th step he wants to move the book number $ b_i $ into his backpack. If the book with number $ b_i $ is in the stack, he takes this book and all the books above the book $ b_i $ , and puts them into the backpack; otherwise he does nothing and begins the next step. For example, if books are arranged in the order $ [1, 2, 3] $ (book $ 1 $ is the topmost), and Vasya moves the books in the order $ [2, 1, 3] $ , then during the first step he will move two books ( $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ ), during the second step he will do nothing (since book $ 1 $ is already in the backpack), and during the third step \u2014 one book (the book number $ 3 $ ). Note that $ b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n $ are distinct.\n\nHelp Vasya! Tell him the number of books he will put into his backpack during each step.",
