    "description": "VK news recommendation system daily selects interesting publications of one of $ n $ disjoint categories for each user. Each publication belongs to exactly one category. For each category $ i $ batch algorithm selects $ a_i $ publications.\n\nThe latest A/B test suggests that users are reading recommended publications more actively if each category has a different number of publications within daily recommendations. The targeted algorithm can find a single interesting publication of $ i $ -th category within $ t_i $ seconds.\n\nWhat is the minimum total time necessary to add publications to the result of batch algorithm execution, so all categories have a different number of publications? You can't remove publications recommended by the batch algorithm.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input consists of single integer $ n $ \u2014 the number of news categories ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 200\\,000 $ ).\n\nThe second line of input consists of $ n $ integers $ a_i $ \u2014 the number of publications of $ i $ -th category selected by the batch algorithm ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ).\n\nThe third line of input consists of $ n $ integers $ t_i $ \u2014 time it takes for targeted algorithm to find one new publication of category $ i $ ( $ 1 \\le t_i \\le 10^5) $ .",
