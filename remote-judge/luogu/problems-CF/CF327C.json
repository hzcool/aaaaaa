    "description": "There is a long plate $ s $ containing $ n $ digits. Iahub wants to delete some digits (possibly none, but he is not allowed to delete all the digits) to form his \"magic number\" on the plate, a number that is divisible by $ 5 $ . Note that, the resulting number may contain leading zeros.\n\nNow Iahub wants to count the number of ways he can obtain magic number, modulo $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ). Two ways are different, if the set of deleted positions in $ s $ differs.\n\nLook at the input part of the statement, $ s $ is given in a special form.",
    "inputFormat": "In the first line you're given a string $ a $ ( $ 1<=|a|<=10^{5} $ ), containing digits only. In the second line you're given an integer $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=10^{9} $ ). The plate $ s $ is formed by concatenating $ k $ copies of $ a $ together. That is $ n=|a|\u00b7k $ .",

The actual plate is 1399013990.\n\nIn the third case, except deleting all digits, any choice will do. Therefore there are $ 2^{6}-1=63 $ possible ways to delete digits.",
