Unfortunately, she didn't know how to dance yet. Therefore, she decided to take a dancing class.There are $ n $ students in the dancing class, including Ela. In the final project, $ n $ students will participate in a choreography described below.\n\n $ n $ students are positioned on the positive side of the $ Ox $ -axis. The $ i $ -th dancer is located at $ a_i > 0 $ . Some dancers will change positions during the dance (we'll call them movable dancers), and others will stay in the same place during a choreography (we'll call them immovable dancers). We distinguish the dancers using a binary string $ s $ of length $ n $ : if $ s_i $ equals '1', then the $ i $ -th dancer is movable, otherwise the $ i $ -th dancer is immovable.\n\nLet's call the \"positive energy value\" of the choreography $ d > 0 $ . The dancers will perform \"movements\" based on this value.\n\nEach minute after the dance begins, the movable dancer with the smallest $ x $ -coordinate will start moving to the right and initiate a \"movement\". At the beginning of the movement, the dancer's energy level will be initiated equally to the positive energy value of the choreography, which is $ d $ . Each time they move from some $ y $ to $ y+1 $ , the energy level will be decreased by $ 1 $ . At some point, the dancer might meet other fellow dancers in the same coordinates. If it happens, then the energy level of the dancer will be increased by $ 1 $ . A dancer will stop moving to the right when his energy level reaches $ 0 $ , and he doesn't share a position with another dancer.\n\nThe dancers are very well-trained, and each \"movement\" will end before the next minute begins.\n\nTo show her understanding of this choreography, Ela has to answer $ q $ queries, each consisting of two integers $ k $ and $ m $ . The answer to this query is the coordinate of the $ m $ -th dancer of both types from the left at $ k $ -th minute after the choreography begins. In other words, denote $ x_{k, 1}, x_{k, 2}, \\dots, x_{k, n} $ as the sorted coordinates of the dancers at $ k $ -th minute from the beginning, you need to print $ x_{k, m} $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ d $ and $ q $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 10^5 $ ; $ 1 \\le d \\le 10^9 $ ; $ 1 \\le q \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of dancers, the positive energy value of the choreography, and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_1 < a_2 < \\dots < a_n \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the coordinates of each dancer.\n\nThe third line contains a binary string $ s $ of length $ n $ \u2014 the movability of each dancer. Each character is either '0' or '1'. It is guaranteed that $ s $ contains at least one character '1'.\n\nThen $ q $ lines follow, the $ i $ -th of them contains two integers $ k_i $ and $ m_i $ ( $ 1 \\le k_i \\le 10^9 $ , $ 1 \\le m_i \\le n $ ) \u2014 the content of each query.",
    "outputFormat": "Output $ q $ lines, each contains a single integer \u2014 the answer for the corresponding query.",

    "hint": "Let's consider the first example test case.\n\nIn the first minute, $ 1 $ is the lowest coordinate between movable dancers. The energy level is initiated with $ 3 $ . Then the following happens:\n\n- The dancer moves from $ 1 $ to $ 2 $ . The energy level decreased to $ 2 $ .\n- The dancer moves from $ 2 $ to $ 3 $ . The energy level decreased to $ 1 $ , then increased to $ 2 $ when she met another dancer at $ 3 $ .\n- The dancer moves from $ 3 $ to $ 4 $ . The energy level decreased to $ 1 $ .\n- The dancer moves from $ 4 $ to $ 5 $ . The energy level decreased to $ 0 $ .\n\nAt the end of the first minute, the sorted coordinates of the dancers become $ [3, 5, 6, 7] $ , and their respective movability is '0111'.\n\nIn the second minute, $ 5 $ is the lowest coordinate between movable dancers. The energy level is initiated with $ 3 $ . Then the following happens:\n\n- The dancer moves from $ 5 $ to $ 6 $ . The energy level decreased to $ 2 $ , then increased to $ 3 $ when she met another dancer at $ 6 $ .\n- The dancer moves from $ 6 $ to $ 7 $ . The energy level decreased to $ 2 $ , then increased to $ 3 $ when she met another dancer at $ 7 $ .\n- The dancer moves from $ 7 $ to $ 8 $ . The energy level decreased to $ 2 $ .\n- The dancer moves from $ 8 $ to $ 9 $ . The energy level decreased to $ 1 $ .\n- The dancer moves from $ 9 $ to $ 10 $ . The energy level decreased to $ 0 $ .\n\nAt the end of the second minute, the sorted coordinates of the dancers become $ [3, 6, 7, 10] $ , and their respective movability is '0111'."
