    "description": "This is the easy version of this problem. The difference between easy and hard versions is only the constraints on $ a_i $ and on $ n $ . You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nBurenka is the crown princess of Buryatia, and soon she will become the $ n $ -th queen of the country. There is an ancient tradition in Buryatia \u2014 before the coronation, the ruler must show their strength to the inhabitants. To determine the strength of the $ n $ -th ruler, the inhabitants of the country give them an array of $ a $ of exactly $ n $ numbers, after which the ruler must turn all the elements of the array into zeros in the shortest time. The ruler can do the following two-step operation any number of times:\n\n- select two indices $ l $ and $ r $ , so that $ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n $ and a non-negative integer $ x $ , then\n- for all $ l \\leq i \\leq r $ assign $ a_i := a_i \\oplus x $ , where $ \\oplus $ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR). It takes $ \\left\\lceil \\frac{r-l+1}{2} \\right\\rceil $ seconds to do this operation, where $ \\lceil y \\rceil $ denotes $ y $ rounded up to the nearest integer.\n\nHelp Burenka calculate how much time she will need.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 500 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 5000 $ ) \u2014 the size of the array.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \\le a_i \\le 5000 $ ) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ in all tests does not exceed $ 5000 $ .",

    "hint": "In the first test case, Burenka can choose segment $ l = 1 $ , $ r = 4 $ , and $ x=5 $ . so it will fill the array with zeros in $ 2 $ seconds.\n\nIn the second test case, Burenka first selects segment $ l = 1 $ , $ r = 2 $ , and $ x = 1 $ , after which $ a = [0, 2, 2] $ , and then the segment $ l = 2 $ , $ r = 3 $ , and $ x=2 $ , which fills the array with zeros.
