    "description": "A sequence of $ n $ numbers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ exactly once. For example, the sequences \\[ $ 3, 1, 4, 2 $ \\], \\[ $ 1 $ \\] and \\[ $ 2,1 $ \\] are permutations, but \\[ $ 1,2,1 $ \\], \\[ $ 0,1 $ \\] and \\[ $ 1,3,4 $ \\] \u2014 are not.\n\nPolycarp lost his favorite permutation and found only some of its elements \u2014 the numbers $ b_1, b_2, \\dots b_m $ . He is sure that the sum of the lost elements equals $ s $ .\n\nDetermine whether one or more numbers can be appended to the given sequence $ b_1, b_2, \\dots b_m $ such that the sum of the added numbers equals $ s $ , and the resulting new array is a permutation?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 100 $ ) \u2014the number of test cases.\n\nThen the descriptions of the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test set contains two integers $ m $ and $ s $ ( $ 1 \\le m \\le 50 $ , $ 1 \\le s \\le 1000 $ )\u2014-the number of found elements and the sum of forgotten numbers.\n\nThe second line of each test set contains $ m $ different integers $ b_1, b_2 \\dots b_m $ ( $ 1 \\le b_i \\le 50 $ ) \u2014 the elements Polycarp managed to find.",
    "outputFormat": "Print $ t $ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test set. Print as the answer YES if you can append several elements to the array $ b $ , that their sum equals $ s $ and the result will be a permutation. Output NO otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (for example, yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive answer).",

Note that the final array will become $ [3,1,4,6,2,5] $ , which is a permutation.\n\nIn the second test case of the example, $ m=1, s=1, b=[1] $ . You cannot append one or more numbers to $ [1] $ such that their sum equals $ 1 $ and the result is a permutation.\n\nIn the third test case of the example, $ m=3, s=3, b=[1,4,2] $ . You can append the number $ 3 $ to $ b $ . Note that the resulting array will be $ [1,4,2,3] $ , which is a permutation.",
