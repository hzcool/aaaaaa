    "description": "Petya loves lucky numbers very much. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.\n\nPetya has an array $ a $ of $ n $ integers. The numbers in the array are numbered starting from $ 1 $ . Unfortunately, Petya has been misbehaving and so, his parents don't allow him play with arrays that have many lucky numbers. It is guaranteed that no more than $ 1000 $ elements in the array $ a $ are lucky numbers.\n\nPetya needs to find the number of pairs of non-intersecting segments $ [l_{1};r_{1}] $ and $ [l_{2};r_{2}] $ ( $ 1<=l_{1}<=r_{1}&lt;l_{2}<=r_{2}<=n $ , all four numbers are integers) such that there's no such lucky number that occurs simultaneously in the subarray $ a[l_{1}..r_{1}] $ and in the subarray $ a[l_{2}..r_{2}] $ . Help Petya count the number of such pairs.",
