    "description": "Limak is an old brown bear. He often goes bowling with his friends. Today he feels really good and tries to beat his own record!\n\nFor rolling a ball one gets a score \u2014 an integer (maybe negative) number of points. Score for $ i $ -th roll is multiplied by $ i $ and scores are summed up. So, for $ k $ rolls with scores $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{k} $ , total score is ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF573E/dc22606298d977fae92bc67b7a4815c447193831.png). Total score is $ 0 $ if there were no rolls.\n\nLimak made $ n $ rolls and got score $ a_{i} $ for $ i $ -th of them. He wants to maximize his total score and he came up with an interesting idea. He will cancel some rolls, saying that something distracted him or there was a strong wind.\n\nLimak is able to cancel any number of rolls, maybe even all or none of them. Total score is calculated as if there were only non-canceled rolls. Look at the sample tests for clarification. What maximum total score can Limak get?",
