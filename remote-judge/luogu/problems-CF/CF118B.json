    "description": "Vasya's birthday is approaching and Lena decided to sew a patterned handkerchief to him as a present. Lena chose digits from $ 0 $ to $ n $ as the pattern. The digits will form a rhombus. The largest digit $ n $ should be located in the centre. The digits should decrease as they approach the edges. For example, for $ n=5 $ the handkerchief pattern should look like that:\n\n```\n          0\n        0 1 0\n      0 1 2 1 0\n    0 1 2 3 2 1 0\n  0 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 0\n0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0\n  0 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 0\n    0 1 2 3 2 1 0\n      0 1 2 1 0\n        0 1 0\n          0\n```\n\nYour task is to determine the way the handkerchief will look like by the given $ n $ .",
