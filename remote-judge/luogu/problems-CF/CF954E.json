    "description": "Consider a system of $ n $ water taps all pouring water into the same container. The $ i $ -th water tap can be set to deliver any amount of water from $ 0 $ to $ a_{i} $ ml per second (this amount may be a real number). The water delivered by $ i $ -th tap has temperature $ t_{i} $ .\n\nIf for every ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF954E/035d166bda223ecd5c31eb614a76bdcc9b8fe8c4.png) you set $ i $ -th tap to deliver exactly $ x_{i} $ ml of water per second, then the resulting temperature of water will be ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF954E/4d0f711b0c4dc1450cd61a20f118d34a644e0d79.png) (if ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF954E/dbce41b29215315b290a54646261b5eaa9727507.png), then to avoid division by zero we state that the resulting water temperature is $ 0 $ ).\n\nYou have to set all the water taps in such a way that the resulting temperature is exactly $ T $ .
