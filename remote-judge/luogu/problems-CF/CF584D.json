    "description": "Dima loves representing an odd number as the sum of multiple primes, and Lisa loves it when there are at most three primes. Help them to represent the given number as the sum of at most than three primes.\n\nMore formally, you are given an odd numer $ n $ . Find a set of numbers $ p_{i} $ ( $ 1<=i<=k $ ), such that\n\n1. $ 1<=k<=3 $\n2. $ p_{i} $ is a prime\n3. ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF584D/e7615e00ba022b6aedbad362df530b3fd81c2681.png)\n\nThe numbers $ p_{i} $ do not necessarily have to be distinct. It is guaranteed that at least one possible solution exists.",
