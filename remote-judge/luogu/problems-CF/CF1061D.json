    "description": "There are $ n $ TV shows you want to watch. Suppose the whole time is split into equal parts called \"minutes\". The $ i $ -th of the shows is going from $ l_i $ -th to $ r_i $ -th minute, both ends inclusive.\n\nYou need a TV to watch a TV show and you can't watch two TV shows which air at the same time on the same TV, so it is possible you will need multiple TVs in some minutes. For example, if segments $ [l_i, r_i] $ and $ [l_j, r_j] $ intersect, then shows $ i $ and $ j $ can't be watched simultaneously on one TV.\n\nOnce you start watching a show on some TV it is not possible to \"move\" it to another TV (since it would be too distracting), or to watch another show on the same TV until this show ends.\n\nThere is a TV Rental shop near you. It rents a TV for $ x $ rupees, and charges $ y $ ( $ y < x $ ) rupees for every extra minute you keep the TV. So in order to rent a TV for minutes $ [a; b] $ you will need to pay $ x + y \\cdot (b - a) $ .\n\nYou can assume, that taking and returning of the TV doesn't take any time and doesn't distract from watching other TV shows. Find the minimum possible cost to view all shows. Since this value could be too large, print it modulo $ 10^9 + 7 $ .",

    "hint": "In the first example, the optimal strategy would be to rent $ 3 $ TVs to watch:\n\n- Show $ [1, 2] $ on the first TV,\n- Show $ [4, 10] $ on the second TV,\n- Shows $ [2, 4], [5, 9], [10, 11] $ on the third TV.\n\nThis way the cost for the first TV is $ 4 + 3 \\cdot (2 - 1) = 7 $ , for the second is $ 4 + 3 \\cdot (10 - 4) = 22 $ and for the third is $ 4 + 3 \\cdot (11 - 2) = 31 $ , which gives $ 60 $ int total.\n\nIn the second example, it is optimal watch each show on a new TV.\n\nIn third example, it is optimal to watch both shows on a new TV. Note that the answer is to be printed modulo $ 10^9 + 7 $ .",
