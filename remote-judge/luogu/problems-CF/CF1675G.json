    "description": "Nastya baked $ m $ pancakes and spread them on $ n $ dishes. The dishes are in a row and numbered from left to right. She put $ a_i $ pancakes on the dish with the index $ i $ .\n\nSeeing the dishes, Vlad decided to bring order to the stacks and move some pancakes. In one move, he can shift one pancake from any dish to the closest one, that is, select the dish $ i $ ( $ a_i > 0 $ ) and do one of the following:\n\n- if $ i > 1 $ , put the pancake on a dish with the previous index, after this move $ a_i = a_i - 1 $ and $ a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} + 1 $ ;\n- if $ i < n $ , put the pancake on a dish with the following index, after this move $ a_i = a_i - 1 $ and $ a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} + 1 $ .\n\nVlad wants to make the array $ a $ non-increasing, after moving as few pancakes as possible. Help him find the minimum number of moves needed for this.\n\nThe array $ a=[a_1, a_2,\\dots,a_n] $ is called non-increasing if $ a_i \\ge a_{i+1} $ for all $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n-1 $ .",
