    "description": "Now Dmitry has a session, and he has to pass $ n $ exams. The session starts on day $ 1 $ and lasts $ d $ days. The $ i $ th exam will take place on the day of $ a_i $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le d $ ), all $ a_i $ \u2014 are different.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1650E/80b5043cb96246fb12fe0316b7ae224994f04da5.png)Sample, where $ n=3 $ , $ d=12 $ , $ a=[3,5,9] $ . Orange \u2014 exam days. Before the first exam Dmitry will rest $ 2 $ days, before the second he will rest $ 1 $ day and before the third he will rest $ 3 $ days.For the session schedule, Dmitry considers a special value $ \\mu $ \u2014 the smallest of the rest times before the exam for all exams. For example, for the image above, $ \\mu=1 $ . In other words, for the schedule, he counts exactly $ n $ numbers \u2014 how many days he rests between the exam $ i-1 $ and $ i $ (for $ i=0 $ between the start of the session and the exam $ i $ ). Then it finds $ \\mu $ \u2014 the minimum among these $ n $ numbers.\n\nDmitry believes that he can improve the schedule of the session. He may ask to change the date of one exam (change one arbitrary value of $ a_i $ ). Help him change the date so that all $ a_i $ remain different, and the value of $ \\mu $ is as large as possible.\n\nFor example, for the schedule above, it is most advantageous for Dmitry to move the second exam to the very end of the session. The new schedule will take the form:\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1650E/ea72ffbaa1a469cfa577e07f4a541e64f273ed21.png)Now the rest periods before exams are equal to $ [2,2,5] $ . So, $ \\mu=2 $ .Dmitry can leave the proposed schedule unchanged (if there is no way to move one exam so that it will lead to an improvement in the situation).",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input data contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of input test cases. The descriptions of test cases follow.\n\nAn empty line is written in the test before each case.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ d $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le d \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the number of exams and the length of the session, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_i $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le d, a_i < a_{i+1} $ ), where the $ i $ -th number means the date of the $ i $ -th exam.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ for all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
