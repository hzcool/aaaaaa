    "description": "Levko loves tables that consist of $ n $ rows and $ n $ columns very much. He especially loves beautiful tables. A table is beautiful to Levko if the sum of elements in each row and column of the table equals $ k $ .\n\nUnfortunately, he doesn't know any such table. Your task is to help him to find at least one of them.",
    "inputFormat": "The single line contains two integers, $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ , $ 1<=k<=1000 $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "Print any beautiful table. Levko doesn't like too big numbers, so all elements of the table mustn't exceed $ 1000 $ in their absolute value.\n\nIf there are multiple suitable tables, you are allowed to print any of them.",

There are other beautiful tables for this sample.\n\nIn the second sample the sum of elements in each row and each column equals $ 7 $ . Besides, there are other tables that meet the statement requirements.",
