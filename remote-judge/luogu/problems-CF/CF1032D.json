    "description": "In this problem we consider a very simplified model of Barcelona city.\n\nBarcelona can be represented as a plane with streets of kind $ x = c $ and $ y = c $ for every integer $ c $ (that is, the rectangular grid). However, there is a detail which makes Barcelona different from Manhattan. There is an avenue called Avinguda Diagonal which can be represented as a the set of points $ (x, y) $ for which $ ax + by + c = 0 $ .\n\nOne can walk along streets, including the avenue. You are given two integer points $ A $ and $ B $ somewhere in Barcelona. Find the minimal possible distance one needs to travel to get to $ B $ from $ A $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ ( $ -10^9\\leq a, b, c\\leq 10^9 $ , at least one of $ a $ and $ b $ is not zero) representing the Diagonal Avenue.\n\nThe next line contains four integers $ x_1 $ , $ y_1 $ , $ x_2 $ and $ y_2 $ ( $ -10^9\\leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2\\leq 10^9 $ ) denoting the points $ A = (x_1, y_1) $ and $ B = (x_2, y_2) $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Find the minimum possible travel distance between $ A $ and $ B $ . Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .\n\nFormally, let your answer be $ a $ , and the jury's answer be $ b $ . Your answer is accepted if and only if $ \\frac{|a - b|}{\\max{(1, |b|)}} \\le 10^{-6} $ .",
