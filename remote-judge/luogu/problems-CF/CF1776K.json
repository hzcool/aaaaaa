    "description": "In a parallel universe there are $ n $ chemical elements, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The element number $ n $ has not been discovered so far, and its discovery would be a pinnacle of research and would bring the person who does it eternal fame and the so-called SWERC prize.\n\nThere are $ m $ independent researchers, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ m $ , that are trying to discover it. Currently, the $ i $ -th researcher has a sample of the element $ s_i $ . Every year, each researcher independently does one fusion experiment. In a fusion experiment, if the researcher currently has a sample of element $ a $ , they produce a sample of an element $ b $ that is chosen uniformly at random between $ a+1 $ and $ n $ , and they lose the sample of element $ a $ . The elements discovered by different researchers or in different years are completely independent.\n\nThe first researcher to discover element $ n $ will get the SWERC prize. If several researchers discover the element in the same year, they all get the prize. For each $ i = 1, \\, 2, \\, \\dots, \\, m $ , you need to compute the probability that the $ i $ -th researcher wins the prize.",
