    "description": "Alice and Bob play a game. There is a paper strip which is divided into $ n+1 $ cells numbered from left to right starting from $ 0 $ . There is a chip placed in the $ n $ -th cell (the last one).\n\nPlayers take turns, Alice is first. Each player during his or her turn has to move the chip $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ or $ k $ cells to the left (so, if the chip is currently in the cell $ i $ , the player can move it into cell $ i-1 $ , $ i-2 $ or $ i-k $ ). The chip should not leave the borders of the paper strip: it is impossible, for example, to move it $ k $ cells to the left if the current cell has number $ i<k $ . The player who can't make a move loses the game.\n\nWho wins if both participants play optimally?\n\nAlice and Bob would like to play several games, so you should determine the winner in each game.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains the single integer $ T $ ( $ 1<=T<=100 $ ) \u2014 the number of games. Next $ T $ lines contain one game per line. All games are independent.\n\nEach of the next $ T $ lines contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 0<=n<=10^{9} $ , $ 3<=k<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the length of the strip and the constant denoting the third move, respectively.",
    "outputFormat": "For each game, print Alice if Alice wins this game and Bob otherwise.",
