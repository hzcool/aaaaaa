    "description": "Valera the horse lives on a plane. The Cartesian coordinate system is defined on this plane. Also an infinite spiral is painted on the plane. The spiral consists of segments:  $ [(0,0),(1,0)] $ , $ [(1,0),(1,1)] $ , $ [(1,1),(-1,1)] $ , $ [(-1,1),(-1,-1)] $ , $ [(-1,-1),(2,-1)] $ , $ [(2,-1),(2,2)] $  and so on. Thus, this infinite spiral passes through each integer point of the plane.\n\nValera the horse lives on the plane at coordinates $ (0,0) $ . He wants to walk along the spiral to point $ (x,y) $ . Valera the horse has four legs, so he finds turning very difficult. Count how many times he will have to turn if he goes along a spiral from point $ (0,0) $ to point $ (x,y) $ .",
