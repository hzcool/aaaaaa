    "description": "Masha works in an advertising agency. In order to promote the new brand, she wants to conclude contracts with some bloggers. In total, Masha has connections of $ n $ different bloggers. Blogger numbered $ i $ has $ a_i $ followers.\n\nSince Masha has a limited budget, she can only sign a contract with $ k $ different bloggers. Of course, Masha wants her ad to be seen by as many people as possible. Therefore, she must hire bloggers with the maximum total number of followers.\n\nHelp her, find the number of ways to select $ k $ bloggers so that the total number of their followers is maximum possible. Two ways are considered different if there is at least one blogger in the first way, which is not in the second way. Masha believes that all bloggers have different followers (that is, there is no follower who would follow two different bloggers).\n\nFor example, if $ n=4 $ , $ k=3 $ , $ a=[1, 3, 1, 2] $ , then Masha has two ways to select $ 3 $ bloggers with the maximum total number of followers:\n\n- conclude contracts with bloggers with numbers $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ . In this case, the number of followers will be equal to $ a_1 + a_2 + a_4 = 6 $ .\n- conclude contracts with bloggers with numbers $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ and $ 4 $ . In this case, the number of followers will be equal to $ a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 6 $ .\n\nSince the answer can be quite large, output it modulo $ 10^9+7 $ .",

Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le k \\le n \\le 1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of bloggers and how many of them you can sign a contract with.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le n $ ) \u2014 the number of followers of each blogger.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 1000 $ .",
