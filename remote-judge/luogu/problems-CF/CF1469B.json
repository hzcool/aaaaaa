    "description": "Monocarp had a sequence $ a $ consisting of $ n + m $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{n + m} $ . He painted the elements into two colors, red and blue; $ n $ elements were painted red, all other $ m $ elements were painted blue.\n\nAfter painting the elements, he has written two sequences $ r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_n $ and $ b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_m $ . The sequence $ r $ consisted of all red elements of $ a $ in the order they appeared in $ a $ ; similarly, the sequence $ b $ consisted of all blue elements of $ a $ in the order they appeared in $ a $ as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the original sequence was lost, and Monocarp only has the sequences $ r $ and $ b $ . He wants to restore the original sequence. In case there are multiple ways to restore it, he wants to choose a way to restore that maximizes the value of\n\n $ $$$f(a) = \\max(0, a_1, (a_1 + a_2), (a_1 + a_2 + a_3), \\dots, (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \\dots + a_{n + m})) $ $ </p><p>Help Monocarp to calculate the maximum possible value of  $ f(a)$$$.",
