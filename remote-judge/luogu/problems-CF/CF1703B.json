    "description": "In an ICPC contest, balloons are distributed as follows:\n\n- Whenever a team solves a problem, that team gets a balloon.\n- The first team to solve a problem gets an additional balloon.\n\n A contest has 26 problems, labelled $ \\textsf{A} $ , $ \\textsf{B} $ , $ \\textsf{C} $ , ..., $ \\textsf{Z} $ . You are given the order of solved problems in the contest, denoted as a string $ s $ , where the $ i $ -th character indicates that the problem $ s_i $ has been solved by some team. No team will solve the same problem twice.Determine the total number of balloons that the teams received. Note that some problems may be solved by none of the teams.",

That team receives $ 2 $ balloons: one because they solved the problem, an an additional one because they are the first team to solve problem $ \\textsf{B} $ .\n- Problem $ \\textsf{A} $ is solved. That team receives only $ 1 $ balloon, because they solved the problem. Note that they don't get an additional balloon because they are not the first team to solve problem $ \\textsf{A} $ .\n\n The total number of balloons given out is $ 2+2+1=5 $ .In the second test case, there is only one problem solved.
