    "description": "Andrew, Fedor and Alex are inventive guys. Now they invent the game with strings for two players.\n\nGiven a group of $ n $ non-empty strings. During the game two players build the word together, initially the word is empty. The players move in turns. On his step player must add a single letter in the end of the word, the resulting word must be prefix of at least one string from the group. A player loses if he cannot move.\n\nAndrew and Alex decided to play this game $ k $ times. The player who is the loser of the $ i $ -th game makes the first move in the $ (i+1) $ -th game. Guys decided that the winner of all games is the player who wins the last ( $ k $ -th) game. Andrew and Alex already started the game. Fedor wants to know who wins the game if both players will play optimally. Help him.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers, $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ; $ 1<=k<=10^{9} $ ).\n\nEach of the next $ n $ lines contains a single non-empty string from the given group. The total length of all strings from the group doesn't exceed $ 10^{5} $ . Each string of the group consists only of lowercase English letters.",
    "outputFormat": "If the player who moves first wins, print \"First\", otherwise print \"Second\" (without the quotes).",
