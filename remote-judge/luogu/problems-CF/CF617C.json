    "description": "A flowerbed has many flowers and two fountains.\n\nYou can adjust the water pressure and set any values $ r_{1}(r_{1}>=0) $ and $ r_{2}(r_{2}>=0) $ , giving the distances at which the water is spread from the first and second fountain respectively. You have to set such $ r_{1} $ and $ r_{2} $ that all the flowers are watered, that is, for each flower, the distance between the flower and the first fountain doesn't exceed $ r_{1} $ , or the distance to the second fountain doesn't exceed $ r_{2} $ . It's OK if some flowers are watered by both fountains.\n\nYou need to decrease the amount of water you need, that is set such $ r_{1} $ and $ r_{2} $ that all the flowers are watered and the $ r_{1}^{2}+r_{2}^{2} $ is minimum possible. Find this minimum value.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains integers $ n $ , $ x_{1} $ , $ y_{1} $ , $ x_{2} $ , $ y_{2} $ ( $ 1<=n<=2000 $ , $ -10^{7}<=x_{1},y_{1},x_{2},y_{2}<=10^{7} $ ) \u2014 the number of flowers, the coordinates of the first and the second fountain.\n\nNext follow $ n $ lines. The $ i $ -th of these lines contains integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ -10^{7}<=x_{i},y_{i}<=10^{7} $ ) \u2014 the coordinates of the $ i $ -th flower.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all $ n+2 $ points in the input are distinct.",
