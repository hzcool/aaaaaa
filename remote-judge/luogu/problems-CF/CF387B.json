    "description": "George decided to prepare a Codesecrof round, so he has prepared $ m $ problems for the round. Let's number the problems with integers $ 1 $ through $ m $ . George estimates the $ i $ -th problem's complexity by integer $ b_{i} $ .\n\nTo make the round good, he needs to put at least $ n $ problems there. Besides, he needs to have at least one problem with complexity exactly $ a_{1} $ , at least one with complexity exactly $ a_{2} $ , ..., and at least one with complexity exactly $ a_{n} $ . Of course, the round can also have problems with other complexities.\n\nGeorge has a poor imagination. It's easier for him to make some already prepared problem simpler than to come up with a new one and prepare it. George is magnificent at simplifying problems. He can simplify any already prepared problem with complexity $ c $ to any positive integer complexity $ d $ ( $ c>=d $ ), by changing limits on the input data.\n\nHowever, nothing is so simple. George understood that even if he simplifies some problems, he can run out of problems for a good round. That's why he decided to find out the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in addition to the $ m $ he's prepared in order to make a good round. Note that George can come up with a new problem of any complexity.",
