    "description": "Two players play a simple game. Each player is provided with a box with balls. First player's box contains exactly $ n_{1} $ balls and second player's box contains exactly $ n_{2} $ balls. In one move first player can take from 1 to $ k_{1} $ balls from his box and throw them away. Similarly, the second player can take from 1 to $ k_{2} $ balls from his box in his move. Players alternate turns and the first player starts the game. The one who can't make a move loses. Your task is to determine who wins if both players play optimally.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains four integers $ n_{1},n_{2},k_{1},k_{2} $ . All numbers in the input are from 1 to 50.\n\nThis problem doesn't have subproblems. You will get 3 points for the correct submission.",
    "outputFormat": "Output \"First\" if the first player wins and \"Second\" otherwise.",

    "hint": "Consider the first sample test. Each player has a box with 2 balls. The first player draws a single ball from his box in one move and the second player can either take 1 or 2 balls from his box in one move. No matter how the first player acts, the second player can always win if he plays wisely.",
