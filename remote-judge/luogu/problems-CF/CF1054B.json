    "description": "Initially Ildar has an empty array. He performs $ n $ steps. On each step he takes a subset of integers already added to the array and appends the mex of this subset to the array.\n\nThe mex of an multiset of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not presented in the multiset. For example, the mex of the multiset $ [0, 2, 3] $ is $ 1 $ , while the mex of the multiset $ [1, 2, 1] $ is $ 0 $ .\n\nMore formally, on the step $ m $ , when Ildar already has an array $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{m-1} $ , he chooses some subset of indices $ 1 \\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_k < m $ (possibly, empty), where $ 0 \\leq k < m $ , and appends the $ mex(a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\ldots a_{i_k}) $ to the end of the array.\n\nAfter performing all the steps Ildar thinks that he might have made a mistake somewhere. He asks you to determine for a given array $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ the minimum step $ t $ such that he has definitely made a mistake on at least one of the steps $ 1, 2, \\ldots, t $ , or determine that he could have obtained this array without mistakes.",

    "outputFormat": "If Ildar could have chosen the subsets on each step in such a way that the resulting array is $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ , print $ -1 $ .\n\nOtherwise print a single integer $ t $ \u2014 the smallest index of a step such that a mistake was made on at least one step among steps $ 1, 2, \\ldots, t $ .",

    "hint": "In the first example it is possible that Ildar made no mistakes. Here is the process he could have followed.\n\n- $ 1 $ -st step. The initial array is empty. He can choose an empty subset and obtain $ 0 $ , because the mex of an empty set is $ 0 $ . Appending this value to the end he gets the array $ [0] $ .\n- $ 2 $ -nd step. The current array is $ [0] $ . He can choose a subset $ [0] $ and obtain an integer $ 1 $ , because $ mex(0) = 1 $ . Appending this value to the end he gets the array $ [0,1] $ .\n- $ 3 $ -rd step. The current array is $ [0,1] $ . He can choose a subset $ [0,1] $ and obtain an integer $ 2 $ , because $ mex(0,1) = 2 $ . Appending this value to the end he gets the array $ [0,1,2] $ .\n- $ 4 $ -th step. The current array is $ [0,1,2] $ . He can choose a subset $ [0] $ and obtain an integer $ 1 $ , because $ mex(0) = 1 $ . Appending this value to the end he gets the array $ [0,1,2,1] $ .\n\nThus, he can get the array without mistakes, so the answer is $ -1 $ .\n\nIn the second example he has definitely made a mistake on the very first step, because he could not have obtained anything different from $ 0 $ .\n\nIn the third example he could have obtained $ [0, 1, 2] $ without mistakes, but $ 239 $ is definitely wrong.",
