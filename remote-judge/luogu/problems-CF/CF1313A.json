    "description": "Tired of boring office work, Denis decided to open a fast food restaurant.\n\nOn the first day he made $ a $ portions of dumplings, $ b $ portions of cranberry juice and $ c $ pancakes with condensed milk.\n\nThe peculiarity of Denis's restaurant is the procedure of ordering food. For each visitor Denis himself chooses a set of dishes that this visitor will receive. When doing so, Denis is guided by the following rules:\n\n- every visitor should receive at least one dish (dumplings, cranberry juice, pancakes with condensed milk are all considered to be dishes);\n- each visitor should receive no more than one portion of dumplings, no more than one portion of cranberry juice and no more than one pancake with condensed milk;\n- all visitors should receive different sets of dishes.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of visitors Denis can feed?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 500 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases to solve.\n\nEach of the remaining $ t $ lines contains integers $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ ( $ 0 \\leq a, b, c \\leq 10 $ ) \u2014 the number of portions of dumplings, the number of portions of cranberry juice and the number of condensed milk pancakes Denis made.",

    "hint": "In the first test case of the example, Denis can feed the first visitor with dumplings, give the second a portion of cranberry juice, and give the third visitor a portion of cranberry juice and a pancake with a condensed milk.\n\nIn the second test case of the example, the restaurant Denis is not very promising: he can serve no customers.\n\nIn the third test case of the example, Denise can serve four visitors. The first guest will receive a full lunch of dumplings, a portion of cranberry juice and a pancake with condensed milk. The second visitor will get only dumplings. The third guest will receive a pancake with condensed milk, and the fourth guest will receive a pancake and a portion of dumplings. Please note that Denis hasn't used all of the prepared products, but is unable to serve more visitors.",
