    "description": "You find yourself on an unusual crossroad with a weird traffic light. That traffic light has three possible colors: red (r), yellow (y), green (g). It is known that the traffic light repeats its colors every $ n $ seconds and at the $ i $ -th second the color $ s_i $ is on.\n\nThat way, the order of the colors is described by a string. For example, if $ s= $ \"rggry\", then the traffic light works as the following: red-green-green-red-yellow-red-green-green-red-yellow- ... and so on.\n\nMore formally, you are given a string $ s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n $ of length $ n $ . At the first second the color $ s_1 $ is on, at the second \u2014 $ s_2 $ , ..., at the $ n $ -th second the color $ s_n $ is on, at the $ n + 1 $ -st second the color $ s_1 $ is on and so on.\n\nYou need to cross the road and that can only be done when the green color is on.\n\nYou know which color is on the traffic light at the moment, but you don't know the current moment of time. You need to find the minimum amount of time in which you are guaranteed to cross the road.\n\nYou can assume that you cross the road immediately.\n\nFor example, with $ s= $ \"rggry\" and the current color r there are two options: either the green color will be on after $ 1 $ second, or after $ 3 $ . That way, the answer is equal to $ 3 $ \u2014 that is the number of seconds that we are guaranteed to cross the road, if the current color is r.",
