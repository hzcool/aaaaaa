    "description": "You are given two strings of equal length $ s $ and $ t $ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may perform any number (possibly, zero) operations on these strings.\n\nDuring each operation you choose two adjacent characters in any string and assign the value of the first character to the value of the second or vice versa.\n\nFor example, if $ s $ is \"acbc\" you can get the following strings in one operation:\n\n- \"aabc\" (if you perform $ s_2 = s_1 $ );\n- \"ccbc\" (if you perform $ s_1 = s_2 $ );\n- \"accc\" (if you perform $ s_3 = s_2 $ or $ s_3 = s_4 $ );\n- \"abbc\" (if you perform $ s_2 = s_3 $ );\n- \"acbb\" (if you perform $ s_4 = s_3 $ );\n\nNote that you can also apply this operation to the string $ t $ .\n\nPlease determine whether it is possible to transform $ s $ into $ t $ , applying the operation above any number of times.\n\nNote that you have to answer $ q $ independent queries.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \\le q \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of queries. Each query is represented by two consecutive lines.\n\nThe first line of each query contains the string $ s $ ( $ 1 \\le |s| \\le 100 $ ) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nThe second line of each query contains the string $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le |t| \\leq 100 $ , $ |t| = |s| $ ) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.",
    "outputFormat": "For each query, print \"YES\" if it is possible to make $ s $ equal to $ t $ , and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will all be recognized as positive answer).",

Therefore, the answer is \"NO\".",
