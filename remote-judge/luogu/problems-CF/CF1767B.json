The $ i $ -th tower consists of $ a_i $ blocks.\n\nIn one move, you can move one block from tower $ i $ to tower $ j $ , but only if $ a_i > a_j $ . That move increases $ a_j $ by $ 1 $ and decreases $ a_i $ by $ 1 $ . You can perform as many moves as you would like (possibly, zero).\n\nWhat's the largest amount of blocks you can have on the tower $ 1 $ after the moves?",
