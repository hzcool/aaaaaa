    "description": " The cool breeze blows gently, the flowing water ripples steadily.\"Flowing and passing like this, the water isn't gone ultimately; Waxing and waning like that, the moon doesn't shrink or grow eventually.\"\n\n\"Everything is transient in a way and perennial in another.\"\n\nKanno doesn't seem to make much sense out of Mino's isolated words, but maybe it's time that they enjoy the gentle breeze and the night sky \u2014 the inexhaustible gifts from nature.\n\nGazing into the sky of stars, Kanno indulges in a night's tranquil dreams.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a set $ S $ of $ n $ points on a coordinate plane.\n\nKanno starts from a point $ P $ that can be chosen on the plane. $ P $ is not added to $ S $ if it doesn't belong to $ S $ . Then the following sequence of operations (altogether called a move) is repeated several times, in the given order:\n\n1. Choose a line $ l $ such that it passes through at least two elements in $ S $ and passes through Kanno's current position. If there are multiple such lines, one is chosen equiprobably.\n2. Move to one of the points that belong to $ S $ and lie on $ l $ . The destination is chosen equiprobably among all possible ones, including Kanno's current position (if it does belong to $ S $ ).\n\nThere are $ q $ queries each consisting of two integers $ (t_i, m_i) $ . For each query, you're to help Kanno maximize the probability of the stopping position being the $ t_i $ -th element in $ S $ after $ m_i $ moves with a proper selection of $ P $ , and output this maximum probability. Note that according to rule 1, $ P $ should belong to at least one line that passes through at least two points from $ S $ .",

The input guarantees that for all $ 1 \\leq i \\lt j \\leq n $ , $ (x_i, y_i) \\neq (x_j, y_j) $ holds.\n\nThe next line contains a positive integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \\leq q \\leq 200 $ ) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nEach of the following $ q $ lines contains two space-separated integers $ t $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \\leq t_i \\leq n $ , $ 1 \\leq m_i \\leq 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the index of the target point and the number of moves, respectively.",
