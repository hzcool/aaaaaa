    "description": "Little Petya likes to play very much. And most of all he likes to play the following game:\n\nHe is given a sequence of $ N $ integer numbers. At each step it is allowed to increase the value of any number by $ 1 $ or to decrease it by $ 1 $ . The goal of the game is to make the sequence non-decreasing with the smallest number of steps. Petya is not good at math, so he asks for your help.\n\nThe sequence $ a $ is called non-decreasing if $ a_{1}<=a_{2}<=...<=a_{N} $ holds, where $ N $ is the length of the sequence.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains single integer $ N $ ( $ 1<=N<=5000 $ ) \u2014 the length of the initial sequence. The following $ N $ lines contain one integer each \u2014 elements of the sequence. These numbers do not exceed $ 10^{9} $ by absolute value.",
    "outputFormat": "Output one integer \u2014 minimum number of steps required to achieve the goal.",
