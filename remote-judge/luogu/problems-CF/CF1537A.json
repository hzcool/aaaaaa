    "description": "An array $ b $ of length $ k $ is called good if its arithmetic mean is equal to $ 1 $ . More formally, if $ $$$\\frac{b_1 + \\cdots + b_k}{k}=1. $ $ </p><p>Note that the value  $ \\\\frac{b\\_1+\\\\cdots+b\\_k}{k} $  is not rounded up or down. For example, the array  $ \\[1,1,1,2\\] $  has an arithmetic mean of  $ 1.25 $ , which is not equal to  $ 1 $ .</p><p>You are given an integer array  $ a $  of length  $ n$$$. In an operation, you can append a non-negative integer to the end of the array. What's the minimum number of operations required to make the array good?\n\nWe have a proof that it is always possible with finitely many operations.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 50 $ ) \u2014 the length of the initial array $ a $ .\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1,\\ldots,a_n $ ( $ -10^4\\leq a_i \\leq 10^4 $ ), the elements of the array.",

    "hint": "In the first test case, we don't need to add any element because the arithmetic mean of the array is already $ 1 $ , so the answer is $ 0 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, the arithmetic mean is not $ 1 $ initially so we need to add at least one more number. If we add $ 0 $ then the arithmetic mean of the whole array becomes $ 1 $ , so the answer is $ 1 $ .\n\nIn the third test case, the minimum number of elements that need to be added is $ 16 $ since only non-negative integers can be added.\n\nIn the fourth test case, we can add a single integer $ 4 $ . The arithmetic mean becomes $ \\frac{-2+4}{2} $ which is equal to $ 1 $ .",
