    "description": "$ n $ people came to the festival and decided to dance a few round dances. There are at least $ 2 $ people in the round dance and each person has exactly two neighbors. If there are $ 2 $ people in the round dance then they have the same neighbor on each side.\n\nYou decided to find out exactly how many dances there were. But each participant of the holiday remembered exactly one neighbor. Your task is to determine what the minimum and maximum number of round dances could be.\n\nFor example, if there were $ 6 $ people at the holiday, and the numbers of the neighbors they remembered are equal $ [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5] $ , then the minimum number of round dances is $ 1 $ :\n\n- $ 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 1 $\n\n and the maximum is $ 3 $ : - $ 1 - 2 - 1 $\n- $ 3 - 4 - 3 $\n- $ 5 - 6 - 5 $",
