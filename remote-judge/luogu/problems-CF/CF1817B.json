    "description": "You are given a simple undirected graph with $ n $ nodes and $ m $ edges. Note that the graph is not necessarily connected. The nodes are labeled from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .\n\nWe define a graph to be a Fish Graph if it contains a simple cycle with a special node $ u $ belonging to the cycle. Apart from the edges in the cycle, the graph should have exactly $ 2 $ extra edges. Both edges should connect to node $ u $ , but they should not be connected to any other node of the cycle.\n\nDetermine if the graph contains a subgraph that is a Fish Graph, and if so, find any such subgraph.\n\nIn this problem, we define a subgraph as a graph obtained by taking any subset of the edges of the original graph.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1817B/42544cf8ec1f14b2230b1ad03e5be53025170222.png) Visualization of example 1.
