    "description": "Olympus City recently launched the production of personal starships. Now everyone on Mars can buy one and fly to other planets inexpensively.\n\nEach starship has a number \u2014some positive integer $ x $ . Let's define the luckiness of a number $ x $ as the difference between the largest and smallest digits of that number. For example, $ 142857 $ has $ 8 $ as its largest digit and $ 1 $ as its smallest digit, so its luckiness is $ 8-1=7 $ . And the number $ 111 $ has all digits equal to $ 1 $ , so its luckiness is zero.\n\nHateehc is a famous Martian blogger who often flies to different corners of the solar system. To release interesting videos even faster, he decided to buy himself a starship. When he came to the store, he saw starships with numbers from $ l $ to $ r $ inclusively. While in the store, Hateehc wanted to find a starship with the luckiest number.\n\nSince there are a lot of starships in the store, and Hateehc can't program, you have to help the blogger and write a program that answers his question.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1808A/e10cd9aa8c24a123d5e125320e42ed0d55b601c6.png)",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000 $ ) \u2014the number of test cases.\n\nEach of the following $ t $ lines contains a description of the test case. The description consists of two integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le 10^6 $ ) \u2014 the largest and smallest numbers of the starships in the store.",
    "outputFormat": "Print $ t $ lines, one line for each test case, containing the luckiest starship number in the store.\n\nIf there are several ways to choose the luckiest number, output any of them.",

    "hint": "Let's look at two test examples:\n\n- the luckiness of the number $ 59 $ is $ 9 - 5 = 4 $ ;\n- the luckiness of $ 60 $ equals $ 6 - 0 = 6 $ ;\n- the luckiness of $ 61 $ equals $ 6 - 1 = 5 $ ;\n- the luckiness of $ 62 $ equals $ 6 - 2 = 4 $ ;\n- the luckiness of $ 63 $ is $ 6 - 3 = 3 $ .\n\n Thus, the luckiest number is $ 60 $ .In the fifth test example, the luckiest number is $ 90 $ ."
