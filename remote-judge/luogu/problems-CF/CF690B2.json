Each vertex of the polygon occupies a point on the lattice. For each cell of the lattice, Heidi knows the level of Zombie Contamination \u2013 the number of corners of the cell that are inside or on the border of the lair.\n\nGiven this information, Heidi wants to know the exact shape of the lair to rain destruction on the zombies. Help her!\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF690B2/2c935730d8a3e2a07073e9f21e778227fe9ea585.png)",

The next $ N $ lines each contain $ N $ characters, describing the level of Zombie Contamination of each cell in the lattice. Every character of every line is a digit between 0 and 4.\n\nCells are given in the same order as they are shown in the picture above: rows go in the decreasing value of $ y $ coordinate, and in one row cells go in the order of increasing $ x $ coordinate. This means that the first row corresponds to cells with coordinates $ (1,N),...,(N,N) $ and the last row corresponds to cells with coordinates $ (1,1),...,(N,1) $ .\n\nThe last line of the file contains a zero. This line should not be treated as a test case. The sum of the $ N $ values for all tests in one file will not exceed $ 5000 $ .",
