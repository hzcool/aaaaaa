    "description": "You are given a binary array $ ^{\\dagger} $ of length $ n $ . You are allowed to perform one operation on it at most once. In an operation, you can choose any element and flip it: turn a $ 0 $ into a $ 1 $ or vice-versa.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of inversions $ ^{\\ddagger} $ the array can have after performing at most one operation?\n\n $ ^\\dagger $ A binary array is an array that contains only zeroes and ones.\n\n $ ^\\ddagger $ The number of inversions in an array is the number of pairs of indices $ i,j $ such that $ i<j $ and $ a_i > a_j $ .",
