    "description": "It is Professor R's last class of his teaching career. Every time Professor R taught a class, he gave a special problem for the students to solve. You being his favourite student, put your heart into solving it one last time.\n\nYou are given two polynomials $ f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \\dots + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} $ and $ g(x) = b_0 + b_1x + \\dots + b_{m-1}x^{m-1} $ , with positive integral coefficients. It is guaranteed that the cumulative GCD of the coefficients is equal to $ 1 $ for both the given polynomials. In other words, $ gcd(a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}) = gcd(b_0, b_1, \\dots, b_{m-1}) = 1 $ . Let $ h(x) = f(x)\\cdot g(x) $ . Suppose that $ h(x) = c_0 + c_1x + \\dots + c_{n+m-2}x^{n+m-2} $ .\n\nYou are also given a prime number $ p $ . Professor R challenges you to find any $ t $ such that $ c_t $ isn't divisible by $ p $ . He guarantees you that under these conditions such $ t $ always exists. If there are several such $ t $ , output any of them.\n\nAs the input is quite large, please use fast input reading methods.",

    "outputFormat": "Print a single integer $ t $ ( $ 0\\le t \\le n+m-2 $ ) \u2014 the appropriate power of $ x $ in $ h(x) $ whose coefficient isn't divisible by the given prime $ p $ . If there are multiple powers of $ x $ that satisfy the condition, print any.",
