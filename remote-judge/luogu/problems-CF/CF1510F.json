    "description": "Imagine a board with $ n $ pins put into it, the $ i $ -th pin is located at $ (x_i, y_i) $ . For simplicity, we will restrict the problem to the case where the pins are placed in vertices of a convex polygon.\n\nThen, take a non-stretchable string of length $ l $ , and put it around all the pins. Place a pencil inside the string and draw a curve around the pins, trying to pull the string in every possible direction. The picture below shows an example of a string tied around the pins and pulled by a pencil (a point $ P $ ).\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1510F/3b434456ce86779edbd75c1c31032e6011c62ac7.png)Your task is to find an area inside this curve. Formally, for a given convex polygon $ S $ and a length $ l $ let's define a fiber shape $ F(S, l) $ as a set of points $ t $ such that the perimeter of the convex hull of $ S \\cup \\{t\\} $ does not exceed $ l $ . Find an area of $ F(S, l) $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ l $ ( $ 3 \\le n \\le 10^4 $ ; $ 1 \\le l \\le 8 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices of the polygon $ S $ and the length of the string. Next $ n $ lines contain integers $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ ( $ -10^5 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 coordinates of polygon's vertices in counterclockwise order. All internal angles of the polygon are strictly less than $ \\pi $ . The length $ l $ exceeds the perimeter of the polygon by at least $ 10^{-3} $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Output a single floating-point number \u2014 the area of the fiber shape $ F(S, l) $ . Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .",
