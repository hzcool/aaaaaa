    "description": "At a geometry lesson Gerald was given a task: to get vector $ B $ out of vector $ A $ . Besides, the teacher permitted him to perform the following operations with vector $ \u0410 $ :\n\n- Turn the vector by $ 90 $ degrees clockwise.\n- Add to the vector a certain vector $ C $ .\n\nOperations could be performed in any order any number of times.\n\nCan Gerald cope with the task?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integers $ x_{1} $ \u0438 $ y_{1} $ \u2014 the coordinates of the vector $ A $ ( $ -10^{8}<=x_{1},y_{1}<=10^{8} $ ). The second and the third line contain in the similar manner vectors $ B $ and $ C $ (their coordinates are integers; their absolute value does not exceed $ 10^{8} $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "Print \"YES\" (without the quotes) if it is possible to get vector $ B $ using the given operations. Otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).",
