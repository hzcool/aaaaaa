    "description": "Kefa decided to make some money doing business on the Internet for exactly $ n $ days. He knows that on the $ i $ -th day ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) he makes $ a_{i} $ money. Kefa loves progress, that's why he wants to know the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment in sequence $ a_{i} $ . Let us remind you that the subsegment of the sequence is its continuous fragment. A subsegment of numbers is called non-decreasing if all numbers in it follow in the non-decreasing order.\n\nHelp Kefa cope with this task!",
