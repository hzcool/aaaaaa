    "description": "First-rate specialists graduate from Berland State Institute of Peace and Friendship. You are one of the most talented students in this university. The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other.\n\nFor example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than $ 4 $ letters. Then several strings with the length $ 2 $ or $ 3 $ symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row. All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word \"suffix\" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to).\n\nHere is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word $ s $ . Find all distinct strings with the length $ 2 $ or $ 3 $ , which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language.\n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match.\n\nLet's look at the example: the word $ abacabaca $ is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF666A/db0a6930c8ac7df2b263a19be9a4e03f20d4a6b4.png), where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by \"corners\". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for this word is $ {aca,ba,ca} $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The only line contains a string $ s $ ( $ 5<=|s|<=10^{4} $ ) consisting of lowercase English letters.",
    "outputFormat": "On the first line print integer $ k $ \u2014 a number of distinct possible suffixes. On the next $ k $ lines print suffixes.\n\nPrint suffixes in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.",

            "abaca\n",
            "0\n"
        ]
    ],
    "hint": "The first test was analysed in the problem statement.\n\nIn the second example the length of the string equals $ 5 $ . The length of the root equals 5, so no string can be used as a suffix.",
