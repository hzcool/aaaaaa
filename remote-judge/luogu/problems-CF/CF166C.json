A median of an array $ (2,6,1,2,3) $ is the number $ 2 $ , and a median of array $ (0,96,17,23) $ \u2014 the number $ 17 $ .\n\nWe define an expression ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF166C/ff48225f7f772c08409f2d464b02c44cf20620e2.png) as the integer part of dividing number $ a $ by number $ b $ .\n\nOne day Vasya showed Petya an array consisting of $ n $ integers and suggested finding the array's median. Petya didn't even look at the array and said that it equals $ x $ . Petya is a very honest boy, so he decided to add several numbers to the given array so that the median of the resulting array would be equal to $ x $ .\n\nPetya can add any integers from $ 1 $ to $ 10^{5} $ to the array, including the same numbers. Of course, he can add nothing to the array. If a number is added multiple times, then we should consider it the number of times it occurs. It is not allowed to delete of change initial numbers of the array.\n\nWhile Petya is busy distracting Vasya, your task is to find the minimum number of elements he will need.",

The second line contains $ n $ space-separated numbers \u2014 the initial array. The elements of the array are integers from $ 1 $ to $ 10^{5} $ . The array elements are not necessarily different.",
