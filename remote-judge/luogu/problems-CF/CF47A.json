    "description": "A triangular number is the number of dots in an equilateral triangle uniformly filled with dots. For example, three dots can be arranged in a triangle; thus three is a triangular number. The $ n $ -th triangular number is the number of dots in a triangle with $ n $ dots on a side. ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF47A/7344b4fd5acb7c973775cffc0c5a51a81c6ee4d9.png).
