    "description": "Polycarpus has a complex electronic device. The core of this device is a circuit board. The board has $ 10^9 $ contact points which are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ 10^9 $ . Also there are $ n $ wires numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , each connecting two distinct contact points on the board. An electric signal can pass between wires $ A $ and $ B $ if:\n\n- either both wires share the same contact point;\n- or there is a sequence of wires starting with $ A $ and ending with $ B $ , and each pair of adjacent wires in the sequence share a contact point.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1250N/6e2b2c43d3bbdc24d7f958ca966b6424ae4f2ebd.png)The picture shows a circuit board with $ 5 $ wires. Contact points with numbers $ 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13 $ are used. Here an electrical signal can pass from wire $ 2 $ to wire $ 3 $ , but not to wire $ 1 $ .Currently the circuit board is broken. Polycarpus thinks that the board could be fixed if the wires were re-soldered so that a signal could pass between any pair of wires.\n\nIt takes $ 1 $ minute for Polycarpus to re-solder an end of a wire. I.e. it takes one minute to change one of the two contact points for a wire. Any contact point from range $ [1, 10^9] $ can be used as a new contact point. A wire's ends must always be soldered to distinct contact points. Both wire's ends can be re-solded, but that will require two actions and will take $ 2 $ minutes in total.\n\nFind the minimum amount of time Polycarpus needs to re-solder wires so that a signal can pass between any pair of wires. Also output an optimal sequence of wire re-soldering.",
    "inputFormat": "The input contains one or several test cases. The first input line contains a single integer $ t $ \u2014 number of test cases. Then, $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of wires. The following $ n $ lines describe wires, each line containing two space-separated integers $ x_i, y_i $ ( $ 1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^9 $ , $ x_i \\neq y_i $ ) \u2014 contact points connected by the $ i $ -th wire. A couple of contact points can be connected with more than one wire.\n\nSum of values of $ n $ across all test cases does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case first print one line with a single integer $ k $ \u2014 the minimum number of minutes needed to re-solder wires so that a signal can pass between any pair of wires. In the following $ k $ lines print the description of re-solderings. Each re-soldering should be described by three integers $ w_j, a_j, b_j $ ( $ 1 \\le w_j \\le n $ , $ 1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le 10^9 $ ). Such triple means that during the $ j $ -th re-soldering an end of the $ w_j $ -th wire, which was soldered to contact point $ a_j $ , becomes soldered to contact point $ b_j $ instead. After each re-soldering of a wire it must connect two distinct contact points. If there are multiple optimal re-solderings, print any of them.",
