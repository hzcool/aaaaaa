    "description": "Bob likes to draw camels: with a single hump, two humps, three humps, etc. He draws a camel by connecting points on a coordinate plane. Now he's drawing camels with $ t $ humps, representing them as polylines in the plane. Each polyline consists of $ n $ vertices with coordinates $ (x_{1},y_{1}) $ , $ (x_{2},y_{2}) $ , ..., $ (x_{n},y_{n}) $ . The first vertex has a coordinate $ x_{1}=1 $ , the second \u2014 $ x_{2}=2 $ , etc. Coordinates $ y_{i} $ might be any, but should satisfy the following conditions:\n\n- there should be $ t $ humps precisely, i.e. such indexes $ j $ ( $ 2<=j<=n-1 $ ), so that $ y_{j-1}&lt;y_{j}&gt;y_{j+1} $ ,\n- there should be precisely $ t-1 $ such indexes $ j $ ( $ 2<=j<=n-1 $ ), so that $ y_{j-1}&gt;y_{j}&lt;y_{j+1} $ ,\n- no segment of a polyline should be parallel to the $ Ox $ -axis,\n- all $ y_{i} $ are integers between 1 and 4.\n\nFor a series of his drawings of camels with $ t $ humps Bob wants to buy a notebook, but he doesn't know how many pages he will need. Output the amount of different polylines that can be drawn to represent camels with $ t $ humps for a given number $ n $ .",
