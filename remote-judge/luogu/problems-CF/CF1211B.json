    "description": "The Golden Ring is the special tourist route in Berland. This route consists of $ n $ cities and the cyclic railway route. Cities are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ so that:\n\n- the next city for $ 1 $ is the city $ 2 $ ,\n- the next city for $ 2 $ is the city $ 3 $ ,\n- ...\n- the next city for $ n $ is the city $ 1 $ .\n\nThus, the route is a cycle, cities are numbered in the direction of travel (the route is directed in one way).\n\nBlogger Polycarp wants to start his journey in the city $ 1 $ . For each city he knows the value $ a_i $ \u2014 how many selfies he wants to do in $ i $ -th city. He can take no more than one selfie in one visit to each city. Since he is traveling by train, he can't skip the city (he always moves from the city $ i $ to the city $ i+1 $ for $ 1 \\le i < n $ and from $ n $ to $ 1 $ ). Thus, when the train stops in the city, Polycarp must visit this city. If Polycarp visits the city multiple times, all visits are counted separately.\n\nWhat is the least number of city visits Polycarp will have to complete to fulfill his plan for the number of selfies for each city? Note that he always visits the city $ 1 $ , since it is this city that his journey begins in.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 3 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of cities in the Golden Ring of Berland.\n\nThe next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ), where $ a_i $ is equal to the required number of selfies in the $ i $ -th city.\n\nIt is guaranteed that at least one of the numbers $ a_i $ is strictly greater than zero.",
