In one move he can swap two neighboring items. Two items $ a_i $ and $ a_j $ are considered neighboring if the condition $ |i - j| = 1 $ is satisfied.\n\nWilliam wants you to calculate the minimal number of swaps he would need to perform to make it so that the array does not contain two neighboring items with the same parity.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $ n $ $ (1 \\le n \\le 10^5) $ which is the total number of items in William's array.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ $ (1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9) $ which are William's array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
