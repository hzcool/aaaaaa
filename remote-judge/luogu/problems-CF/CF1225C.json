    "description": "Vasya will fancy any number as long as it is an integer power of two. Petya, on the other hand, is very conservative and only likes a single integer $ p $ (which may be positive, negative, or zero). To combine their tastes, they invented  $ p $ -binary numbers of the form $ 2^x + p $ , where $ x $ is a non-negative integer.\n\nFor example, some $ -9 $ -binary (\"minus nine\" binary) numbers are: $ -8 $ (minus eight), $ 7 $ and $ 1015 $ ( $ -8=2^0-9 $ , $ 7=2^4-9 $ , $ 1015=2^{10}-9 $ ).\n\nThe boys now use $ p $ -binary numbers to represent everything. They now face a problem: given a positive integer $ n $ , what's the smallest number of $ p $ -binary numbers (not necessarily distinct) they need to represent $ n $ as their sum? It may be possible that representation is impossible altogether. Help them solve this problem.\n\nFor example, if $ p=0 $ we can represent $ 7 $ as $ 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 $ .\n\nAnd if $ p=-9 $ we can represent $ 7 $ as one number $ (2^4-9) $ .\n\nNote that negative $ p $ -binary numbers are allowed to be in the sum (see the Notes section for an example).",

    "hint": " $ 0 $ -binary numbers are just regular binary powers, thus in the first sample case we can represent $ 24 = (2^4 + 0) + (2^3 + 0) $ .\n\nIn the second sample case, we can represent $ 24 = (2^4 + 1) + (2^2 + 1) + (2^0 + 1) $ .\n\nIn the third sample case, we can represent $ 24 = (2^4 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) $ . Note that repeated summands are allowed.\n\nIn the fourth sample case, we can represent $ 4 = (2^4 - 7) + (2^1 - 7) $ . Note that the second summand is negative, which is allowed.\n\nIn the fifth sample case, no representation is possible.",
