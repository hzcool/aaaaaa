    "description": "Once Max found an electronic calculator from his grandfather Dovlet's chest. He noticed that the numbers were written with seven-segment indicators ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment\\_display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display)).\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF620B/67b24c9a2393a33eff16b95f90d96d29b0d56e85.png)Max starts to type all the values from $ a $ to $ b $ . After typing each number Max resets the calculator. Find the total number of segments printed on the calculator.\n\nFor example if $ a=1 $ and $ b=3 $ then at first the calculator will print $ 2 $ segments, then \u2014 $ 5 $ segments and at last it will print $ 5 $ segments. So the total number of printed segments is $ 12 $ .",
