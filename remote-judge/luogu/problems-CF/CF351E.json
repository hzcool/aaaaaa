    "description": "Jeff's friends know full well that the boy likes to get sequences and arrays for his birthday. Thus, Jeff got sequence $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ for his birthday.\n\nJeff hates inversions in sequences. An inversion in sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ is a pair of indexes $ i,j $ $ (1<=i<j<=n) $ , such that an inequality $ a_{i}>a_{j} $ holds.\n\nJeff can multiply some numbers of the sequence $ p $ by -1. At that, he wants the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Help Jeff and find the minimum number of inversions he manages to get.",
