    "description": "Ksyusha has a pet chinchilla, a tree on $ n $ vertices and huge scissors. A tree is a connected graph without cycles. During a boring physics lesson Ksyusha thought about how to entertain her pet.\n\nChinchillas like to play with branches. A branch is a tree of $ 3 $ vertices.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1833G/ae285d277e72e33b2fe2f64d0c71420fe6d95626.png) The branch looks like this.A cut is the removal of some (not yet cut) edge in the tree. Ksyusha has plenty of free time, so she can afford to make enough cuts so that the tree splits into branches. In other words, after several (possibly zero) cuts, each vertex must belong to exactly one branch.\n\nHelp Ksyusha choose the edges to be cut or tell that it is impossible.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe next $ n - 1 $ rows of each testcase contain integers $ v_i $ and $ u_i $ ( $ 1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n $ ) \u2014 the numbers of vertices that the $ i $ -th edge connects.\n\nIt is guaranteed that this set of edges forms a tree. It is also guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all testcases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Print the answer for each testcase.\n\nIf the desired way to cut the tree does not exist, print $ -1 $ .\n\nOtherwise, print an integer $ k $ \u2014 the number of edges to be cut. In the next line, print $ k $ different integers $ e_i $ ( $ 1 \\le e_i < n $ ) \u2014 numbers of the edges to be cut. If $ k = 0 $ , print an empty string instead.\n\nIf there are several solutions, you can print any.",
