    "description": "Vasya and Petya were tired of studying so they decided to play a game. Before the game begins Vasya looks at array $ a $ consisting of $ n $ integers. As soon as he remembers all elements of $ a $ the game begins. Vasya closes his eyes and Petya does $ q $ actions of one of two types:\n\n $ 1) $ Petya says 4 integers $ l1,r1,l2,r2 $ \u2014 boundaries of two non-intersecting segments. After that he swaps one random element from the $ [l1,r1] $ segment with another random element from the $ [l2,r2] $ segment.\n\n $ 2) $ Petya asks Vasya the sum of the elements of $ a $ in the $ [l,r] $ segment.\n\nVasya is a mathematician so he answers Petya the mathematical expectation of the sum of the elements in the segment.\n\nYour task is to write a program which will answer the second type questions as Vasya would do it. In other words your program should print the mathematical expectation of the sum of the elements of $ a $ in the $ [l,r] $ segment for every second type query.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n,q $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5},1<=q<=10^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of elements in the array and the number of queries you need to handle.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nThe next $ q $ lines contain Petya's actions of type 1 or 2.\n\nIf it is a type $ 1 $ action then the line contains $ 5 $ integers $ 1,l1,r1,l2,r2 $ ( $ 1<=l1<=r1<=n,1<=l2<=r2<=n $ ).\n\nIf it is a type $ 2 $ query then the line contains $ 3 $ integers $ 2,l,r $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one type $ 2 $ query and segments $ [l1,r1],[l2,r2] $ don't have common elements.",
    "outputFormat": "For each type $ 2 $ query print one real number \u2014 the mathematical expectation of the sum of elements in the segment.\n\nYour answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $ 10^{-4} $ \u2014 formally, the answer is correct if ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF895E/1e3a6016727b2f57aeaab3dcbe84256bba31c89a.png) where $ x $ is jury's answer and $ y $ is yours.",
