    "description": "Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.\n\nPetya calls a number almost lucky if it could be evenly divided by some lucky number. Help him find out if the given number $ n $ is almost lucky.",
    "inputFormat": "The single line contains an integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=1000) $ \u2014 the number that needs to be checked.",
    "outputFormat": "In the only line print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if number $ n $ is almost lucky. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without the quotes).",
    "samples": [
        [
            "47\n",
            "YES\n"

        ]
    ],
    "hint": "Note that all lucky numbers are almost lucky as any number is evenly divisible by itself.\n\nIn the first sample $ 47 $ is a lucky number. In the second sample $ 16 $ is divisible by $ 4 $ .",
