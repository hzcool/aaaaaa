    "description": "Nikita likes tasks on order statistics, for example, he can easily find the $ k $ -th number in increasing order on a segment of an array. But now Nikita wonders how many segments of an array there are such that a given number $ x $ is the $ k $ -th number in increasing order on this segment. In other words, you should find the number of segments of a given array such that there are exactly $ k $ numbers of this segment which are less than $ x $ .\n\nNikita wants to get answer for this question for each $ k $ from $ 0 $ to $ n $ , where $ n $ is the size of the array.",
