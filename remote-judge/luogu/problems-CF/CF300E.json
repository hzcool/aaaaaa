To cope with the republican threat, the Supreme Council decided to deal a decisive blow to the enemy forces.\n\nTo successfully complete the conflict, the confrontation balance after the blow should be a positive integer. The balance of confrontation is a number that looks like ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF300E/ae456f9650d5b3ca46e54c303d07fec088f6ad5e.png), where $ p=n! $ ( $ n $ is the power of the Imperial strike), ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF300E/99b314c14cf87aaec7902ee9933ec2e853964496.png). After many years of war the Empire's resources are low. So to reduce the costs, $ n $ should be a minimum positive integer that is approved by the commanders.\n\nHelp the Empire, find the minimum positive integer $ n $ , where the described fraction is a positive integer.",
