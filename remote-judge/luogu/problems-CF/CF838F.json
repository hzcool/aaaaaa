    "description": "You are playing a game with a bag of red and black balls. Initially, you are told that the bag has $ n $ balls total. In addition, you are also told that the bag has probability $ p_{i}/10^{6} $ of containing exactly $ i $ red balls.\n\nYou now would like to buy balls from this bag. You really like the color red, so red balls are worth a unit of $ 1 $ , while black balls are worth nothing. To buy a ball, if there are still balls in the bag, you pay a cost $ c $ with $ 0<=c<=1 $ , and draw a ball randomly from the bag. You can choose to stop buying at any point (and you can even choose to not buy anything at all).\n\nGiven that you buy optimally to maximize the expected profit (i.e. # red balls - cost needed to obtain them), print the maximum expected profit.",
