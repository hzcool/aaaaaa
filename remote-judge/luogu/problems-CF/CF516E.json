    "description": "Drazil has many friends. Some of them are happy and some of them are unhappy. Drazil wants to make all his friends become happy. So he invented the following plan.\n\nThere are $ n $ boys and $ m $ girls among his friends. Let's number them from $ 0 $ to $ n-1 $ and $ 0 $ to $ m-1 $ separately. In $ i $ -th day, Drazil invites $i\\bmod n$ -th boy and $i\\bmod m$ -th girl to have dinner together (as Drazil is programmer, $ i $ starts from $ 0 $ ). If one of those two people is happy, the other one will also become happy. Otherwise, those two people remain in their states. Once a person becomes happy (or if it is happy originally), he stays happy forever.\n\nDrazil wants to know on which day all his friends become happy or to determine if they won't become all happy at all.",

They are both unhappy, so nothing changes at this day.\n- On the 2-nd day, Drazil invites 0-th boy and 2-nd girl. Because 0-th boy is already happy he makes 2-nd girl become happy at this day.\n- On the 3-rd day, Drazil invites 1-st boy and 0-th girl. 0-th girl is happy, so she makes 1-st boy happy.\n- On the 4-th day, Drazil invites 0-th boy and 1-st girl. 0-th boy is happy, so he makes the 1-st girl happy.
