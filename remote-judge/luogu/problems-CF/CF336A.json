    "description": "Vasily the bear has a favorite rectangle, it has one vertex at point $ (0,0) $ , and the opposite vertex at point $ (x,y) $ . Of course, the sides of Vasya's favorite rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes.\n\nVasya also loves triangles, if the triangles have one vertex at point $ B=(0,0) $ . That's why today he asks you to find two points $ A=(x_{1},y_{1}) $ and $ C=(x_{2},y_{2}) $ , such that the following conditions hold:\n\n- the coordinates of points: $ x_{1} $ , $ x_{2} $ , $ y_{1} $ , $ y_{2} $ are integers. Besides, the following inequation holds: $ x_{1}&lt;x_{2} $ ;\n- the triangle formed by point $ A $ , $ B $ and $ C $ is rectangular and isosceles (![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF336A/722fcc24f0ddfe8fedfe378a89e62bfed7c996ca.png) is right);\n- all points of the favorite rectangle are located inside or on the border of triangle $ ABC $ ;\n- the area of triangle $ ABC $ is as small as possible.\n\nHelp the bear, find the required points. It is not so hard to proof that these points are unique.",
