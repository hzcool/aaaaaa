    "description": "This is an interactive problem.\n\nThere is an array $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ of $ n $ integers hidden from you. Your task is to find the smallest element of the array.\n\nTo do this, you can ask several queries. In each query, you can pick two integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n $ ). In return, you will be given the value of $ \\max(a_l, a_{l+1}, \\dots, a_r) $ . In other words, you will be told the maximum value of the subarray from $ a_l $ to $ a_r $ .\n\nFind the minimum of the array. You can ask at most $ \\mathbf{624} $ queries.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the values $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ are chosen uniformly at random between $ 0 $ and $ 2^{32}-1 $ (inclusive).",

    "outputFormat": "Begin the interaction by reading an integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 10^4 $ ) on a separate line.\n\nTo ask a query, print a line in the form $ \\texttt{?}\\;\\;l\\;\\;r $ ( $ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n $ ). Then you should read a single line containing the answer to your query.\n\nAfter you have determined the answer, print a line in the form $ \\texttt{!}\\;\\;x $ where $ x $ is the minimum value.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nAnswer $ \\texttt{-1} $ means that you made an invalid query. Exit immediately after receiving $ \\texttt{-1} $ and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.",
