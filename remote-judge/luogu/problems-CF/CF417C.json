    "description": "One day, at the \"Russian Code Cup\" event it was decided to play football as an out of competition event. All participants was divided into $ n $ teams and played several matches, two teams could not play against each other more than once.\n\nThe appointed Judge was the most experienced member \u2014 Pavel. But since he was the wisest of all, he soon got bored of the game and fell asleep. Waking up, he discovered that the tournament is over and the teams want to know the results of all the matches.\n\nPavel didn't want anyone to discover about him sleeping and not keeping an eye on the results, so he decided to recover the results of all games. To do this, he asked all the teams and learned that the real winner was friendship, that is, each team beat the other teams exactly $ k $ times. Help Pavel come up with chronology of the tournir that meets all the conditions, or otherwise report that there is no such table.",

    "outputFormat": "In the first line print an integer $ m $ \u2014 number of the played games. The following $ m $ lines should contain the information about all the matches, one match per line. The $ i $ -th line should contain two integers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n $ ; $ a_{i}\u2260b_{i} $ ). The numbers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ mean, that in the $ i $ -th match the team with number $ a_{i} $ won against the team with number $ b_{i} $ . You can assume, that the teams are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .\n\nIf a tournir that meets the conditions of the problem does not exist, then print -1.",
