    "description": "At the children's day, the child came to Picks's house, and messed his house up. Picks was angry at him. A lot of important things were lost, in particular the favorite set of Picks.\n\nFortunately, Picks remembers something about his set $ S $ :\n\n- its elements were distinct integers from $ 1 $ to $ limit $ ;\n- the value of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF437B/88e174ec7cf915d3f747f56e083fd307f02a2ea9.png) was equal to $ sum $ ; here $ lowbit(x) $ equals $ 2^{k} $ where $ k $ is the position of the first one in the binary representation of $ x $ . For example, $ lowbit(10010_{2})=10_{2},lowbit(10001_{2})=1_{2},lowbit(10000_{2})=10000_{2} $ (binary representation).\n\nCan you help Picks and find any set $ S $ , that satisfies all the above conditions?",
