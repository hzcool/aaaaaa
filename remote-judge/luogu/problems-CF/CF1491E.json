    "description": "Let $ F_k $ denote the $ k $ -th term of Fibonacci sequence, defined as below:\n\n- $ F_0 = F_1 = 1 $\n- for any integer $ n \\geq 0 $ , $ F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n $\n\nYou are given a tree with $ n $ vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.\n\nWe call a tree a Fib-tree, if its number of vertices equals $ F_k $ for some $ k $ , and at least one of the following conditions holds:\n\n- The tree consists of only $ 1 $ vertex;\n- You can divide it into two Fib-trees by removing some edge of the tree.\n\nDetermine whether the given tree is a Fib-tree or not.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThen $ n-1 $ lines follow, each of which contains two integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1\\leq u,v \\leq n $ , $ u \\neq v $ ), representing an edge between vertices $ u $ and $ v $ . It's guaranteed that given edges form a tree.",
    "outputFormat": "Print \"YES\" if the given tree is a Fib-tree, or \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can print your answer in any case. For example, if the answer is \"YES\", then the output \"Yes\" or \"yeS\" will also be considered as correct answer.",

    "hint": "In the first sample, we can cut the edge $ (1, 2) $ , and the tree will be split into $ 2 $ trees of sizes $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ correspondently. Any tree of size $ 2 $ is a Fib-tree, as it can be split into $ 2 $ trees of size $ 1 $ .\n\nIn the second sample, no matter what edge we cut, the tree will be split into $ 2 $ trees of sizes $ 1 $ and $ 4 $ . As $ 4 $ isn't $ F_k $ for any $ k $ , it's not Fib-tree.\n\nIn the third sample, here is one possible order of cutting the edges so that all the trees in the process are Fib-trees: $ (1, 3), (1, 2), (4, 5), (3, 4) $ .",
