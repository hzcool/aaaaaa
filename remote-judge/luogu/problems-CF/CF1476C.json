    "description": "You have $ n $ chains, the $ i $ -th chain consists of $ c_i $ vertices. Vertices in each chain are numbered independently from $ 1 $ to $ c_i $ along the chain. In other words, the $ i $ -th chain is the undirected graph with $ c_i $ vertices and $ (c_i - 1) $ edges connecting the $ j $ -th and the $ (j + 1) $ -th vertices for each $ 1 \\le j < c_i $ .\n\nNow you decided to unite chains in one graph in the following way:\n\n1. the first chain is skipped;\n2. the $ 1 $ -st vertex of the $ i $ -th chain is connected by an edge with the $ a_i $ -th vertex of the $ (i - 1) $ -th chain;\n3. the last ( $ c_i $ -th) vertex of the $ i $ -th chain is connected by an edge with the $ b_i $ -th vertex of the $ (i - 1) $ -th chain.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1476C/c3d2e7e1f5aff9aaa07bb3c082d03d1303c3b897.png)Picture of the first test case. Dotted lines are the edges added during uniting processCalculate the length of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph.\n\nA simple cycle is a chain where the first and last vertices are connected as well. If you travel along the simple cycle, each vertex of this cycle will be visited exactly once.",
