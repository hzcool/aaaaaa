    "description": "The classic programming language of Bitland is Bit++. This language is so peculiar and complicated.\n\nThe language is that peculiar as it has exactly one variable, called $ x $ . Also, there are two operations:\n\n- Operation ++ increases the value of variable $ x $ by 1.\n- Operation -- decreases the value of variable $ x $ by 1.\n\nA statement in language Bit++ is a sequence, consisting of exactly one operation and one variable $ x $ . The statement is written without spaces, that is, it can only contain characters \"+\", \"-\", \"X\". Executing a statement means applying the operation it contains.\n\nA programme in Bit++ is a sequence of statements, each of them needs to be executed. Executing a programme means executing all the statements it contains.\n\nYou're given a programme in language Bit++. The initial value of $ x $ is $ 0 $ . Execute the programme and find its final value (the value of the variable when this programme is executed).",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=150) $ \u2014 the number of statements in the programme.\n\nNext $ n $ lines contain a statement each. Each statement contains exactly one operation (++ or --) and exactly one variable $ x $ (denoted as letter \u00abX\u00bb). Thus, there are no empty statements. The operation and the variable can be written in any order.",
