    "description": "To celebrate the second ABBYY Cup tournament, the Smart Beaver decided to throw a party. The Beaver has a lot of acquaintances, some of them are friends with each other, and some of them dislike each other. To make party successful, the Smart Beaver wants to invite only those of his friends who are connected by friendship relations, and not to invite those who dislike each other. Both friendship and dislike are mutual feelings.\n\nMore formally, for each invited person the following conditions should be fulfilled:\n\n- all his friends should also be invited to the party;\n- the party shouldn't have any people he dislikes;\n- all people who are invited to the party should be connected with him by friendship either directly or through a chain of common friends of arbitrary length. We'll say that people $ a_{1} $ and $ a_{p} $ are connected through a chain of common friends if there exists a sequence of people $ a_{2},a_{3},...,a_{p-1} $ such that all pairs of people $ a_{i} $ and $ a_{i+1} $ ( $ 1<=i<p $ ) are friends.\n\nHelp the Beaver find the maximum number of acquaintances he can invite.",
