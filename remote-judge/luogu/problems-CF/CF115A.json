    "description": "A company has $ n $ employees numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Each employee either has no immediate manager or exactly one immediate manager, who is another employee with a different number. An employee $ A $ is said to be the superior of another employee $ B $ if at least one of the following is true:\n\n- Employee $ A $ is the immediate manager of employee $ B $\n- Employee $ B $ has an immediate manager employee $ C $ such that employee $ A $ is the superior of employee $ C $ .\n\nThe company will not have a managerial cycle. That is, there will not exist an employee who is the superior of his/her own immediate manager.\n\nToday the company is going to arrange a party. This involves dividing all $ n $ employees into several groups: every employee must belong to exactly one group. Furthermore, within any single group, there must not be two employees $ A $ and $ B $ such that $ A $ is the superior of $ B $ .\n\nWhat is the minimum number of groups that must be formed?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2000 $ ) \u2014 the number of employees.\n\nThe next $ n $ lines contain the integers $ p_{i} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i}<=n $ or $ p_{i}= $ -1). Every $ p_{i} $ denotes the immediate manager for the $ i $ -th employee. If $ p_{i} $ is -1, that means that the $ i $ -th employee does not have an immediate manager.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that no employee will be the immediate manager of him/herself ( $ p_{i}\u2260i $ ). Also, there will be no managerial cycles.",
