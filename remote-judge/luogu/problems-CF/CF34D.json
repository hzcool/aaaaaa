    "description": "There are $ n $ cities in Berland. Each city has its index \u2014 an integer number from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The capital has index $ r_{1} $ . All the roads in Berland are two-way. The road system is such that there is exactly one path from the capital to each city, i.e. the road map looks like a tree. In Berland's chronicles the road map is kept in the following way: for each city $ i $ , different from the capital, there is kept number $ p_{i} $ \u2014 index of the last city on the way from the capital to $ i $ .\n\nOnce the king of Berland Berl XXXIV decided to move the capital from city $ r_{1} $ to city $ r_{2} $ . Naturally, after this the old representation of the road map in Berland's chronicles became incorrect. Please, help the king find out a new representation of the road map in the way described above.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three space-separated integers $ n $ , $ r_{1} $ , $ r_{2} $ ( $ 2<=n<=5\u00b710^{4},1<=r_{1}\u2260r_{2}<=n $ ) \u2014 amount of cities in Berland, index of the old capital and index of the new one, correspondingly.\n\nThe following line contains $ n-1 $ space-separated integers \u2014 the old representation of the road map. For each city, apart from $ r_{1} $ , there is given integer $ p_{i} $ \u2014 index of the last city on the way from the capital to city $ i $ . All the cities are described in order of increasing indexes.",
