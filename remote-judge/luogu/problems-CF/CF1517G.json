    "description": "At the foot of Liyushan Mountain, $ n $ tents will be carefully arranged to provide accommodation for those who are willing to experience the joy of approaching nature, the tranquility of the night, and the bright starry sky.\n\nThe $ i $ -th tent is located at the point of $ (x_i, y_i) $ and has a weight of $ w_i $ . A tent is important if and only if both $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ are even. You need to remove some tents such that for each remaining important tent $ (x, y) $ , there do not exist $ 3 $ other tents $ (x'_1, y'_1) $ , $ (x'_2, y'_2) $ and $ (x'_3, y'_3) $ such that both conditions are true:\n\n1. $ |x'_j-x|, |y'_j - y|\\leq 1 $ for all $ j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $ , and\n2. these four tents form a parallelogram (or a rectangle) and one of its sides is parallel to the $ x $ -axis.\n\nPlease maximize the sum of the weights of the tents that are not removed. Print the maximum value.",
