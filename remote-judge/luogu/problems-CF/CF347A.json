    "description": "You want to arrange $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ in some order in a row. Let's define the value of an arrangement as the sum of differences between all pairs of adjacent integers.\n\nMore formally, let's denote some arrangement as a sequence of integers $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n} $ , where sequence $ x $ is a permutation of sequence $ a $ . The value of such an arrangement is $ (x_{1}-x_{2})+(x_{2}-x_{3})+...+(x_{n-1}-x_{n}) $ .\n\nFind the largest possible value of an arrangement. Then, output the lexicographically smallest sequence $ x $ that corresponds to an arrangement of the largest possible value.",
