William mastered performing three different operations with them quickly. Before performing each operation some positive integer $ k $ is picked, which is then used to perform one of the following operations: (note, that for each operation you can choose a new positive integer $ k $ )\n\n1. add number $ k $ to both $ a $ and $ b $ , or\n2. add number $ k $ to $ a $ and subtract $ k $ from $ b $ , or\n3. add number $ k $ to $ b $ and subtract $ k $ from $ a $ .\n\nNote that after performing operations, numbers $ a $ and $ b $ may become negative as well.\n\nWilliam wants to find out the minimal number of operations he would have to perform to make $ a $ equal to his favorite number $ c $ and $ b $ equal to his second favorite number $ d $ .",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers $ c $ and $ d $ $ (0 \\le c, d \\le 10^9) $ , which are William's favorite numbers and which he wants $ a $ and $ b $ to be transformed into.",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case output a single number, which is the minimal number of operations which William would have to perform to make $ a $ equal to $ c $ and $ b $ equal to $ d $ , or $ -1 $ if it is impossible to achieve this using the described operations.",
