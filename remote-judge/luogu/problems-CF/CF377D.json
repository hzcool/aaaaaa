    "description": "Pavel is going to make a game of his dream. However, he knows that he can't make it on his own so he founded a development company and hired $ n $ workers of staff. Now he wants to pick $ n $ workers from the staff who will be directly responsible for developing a game.\n\nEach worker has a certain skill level $ v_{i} $ . Besides, each worker doesn't want to work with the one whose skill is very different. In other words, the $ i $ -th worker won't work with those whose skill is less than $ l_{i} $ , and with those whose skill is more than $ r_{i} $ .\n\nPavel understands that the game of his dream isn't too hard to develop, so the worker with any skill will be equally useful. That's why he wants to pick a team of the maximum possible size. Help him pick such team.",
