    "description": "You have a long fence which consists of $ n $ sections. Unfortunately, it is not painted, so you decided to hire $ q $ painters to paint it. $ i $ -th painter will paint all sections $ x $ such that $ l_i \\le x \\le r_i $ .\n\nUnfortunately, you are on a tight budget, so you may hire only $ q - 2 $ painters. Obviously, only painters you hire will do their work.\n\nYou want to maximize the number of painted sections if you choose $ q - 2 $ painters optimally. A section is considered painted if at least one painter paints it.",
