    "description": "Mahmoud wrote a message $ s $ of length $ n $ . He wants to send it as a birthday present to his friend Moaz who likes strings. He wrote it on a magical paper but he was surprised because some characters disappeared while writing the string. That's because this magical paper doesn't allow character number $ i $ in the English alphabet to be written on it in a string of length more than $ a_{i} $ . For example, if $ a_{1}=2 $ he can't write character 'a' on this paper in a string of length $ 3 $ or more. String \"aa\" is allowed while string \"aaa\" is not.\n\nMahmoud decided to split the message into some non-empty substrings so that he can write every substring on an independent magical paper and fulfill the condition. The sum of their lengths should be $ n $ and they shouldn't overlap. For example, if $ a_{1}=2 $ and he wants to send string \"aaa\", he can split it into \"a\" and \"aa\" and use $ 2 $ magical papers, or into \"a\", \"a\" and \"a\" and use $ 3 $ magical papers. He can't split it into \"aa\" and \"aa\" because the sum of their lengths is greater than $ n $ . He can split the message into single string if it fulfills the conditions.\n\nA substring of string $ s $ is a string that consists of some consecutive characters from string $ s $ , strings \"ab\", \"abc\" and \"b\" are substrings of string \"abc\", while strings \"acb\" and \"ac\" are not. Any string is a substring of itself.\n\nWhile Mahmoud was thinking of how to split the message, Ehab told him that there are many ways to split it. After that Mahmoud asked you three questions:\n\n- How many ways are there to split the string into substrings such that every substring fulfills the condition of the magical paper, the sum of their lengths is $ n $ and they don't overlap? Compute the answer modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .\n- What is the maximum length of a substring that can appear in some valid splitting?\n- What is the minimum number of substrings the message can be spit in?\n\nTwo ways are considered different, if the sets of split positions differ. For example, splitting \"aa|a\" and \"a|aa\" are considered different splittings of message \"aaa\".",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{3} $ ) denoting the length of the message.\n\nThe second line contains the message $ s $ of length $ n $ that consists of lowercase English letters.\n\nThe third line contains $ 26 $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{26} $ ( $ 1<=a_{x}<=10^{3} $ ) \u2014 the maximum lengths of substring each letter can appear in.",
    "outputFormat": "Print three lines.\n\nIn the first line print the number of ways to split the message into substrings and fulfill the conditions mentioned in the problem modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .\n\nIn the second line print the length of the longest substring over all the ways.\n\nIn the third line print the minimum number of substrings over all the ways.",
