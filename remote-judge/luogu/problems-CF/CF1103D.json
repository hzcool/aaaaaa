    "description": "Cardbluff is popular sport game in Telegram. Each Cardbluff player has ever dreamed about entrance in the professional layer. There are $ n $ judges now in the layer and you are trying to pass the entrance exam. You have a number $ k $ \u2014 your skill in Cardbluff.\n\nEach judge has a number $ a_i $ \u2014 an indicator of uncertainty about your entrance to the professional layer and a number $ e_i $ \u2014 an experience playing Cardbluff. To pass the exam you need to convince all judges by playing with them. You can play only one game with each judge. As a result of a particular game, you can divide the uncertainty of $ i $ -th judge by any natural divisor of $ a_i $ which is at most $ k $ . If GCD of all indicators is equal to $ 1 $ , you will enter to the professional layer and become a judge.\n\nAlso, you want to minimize the total amount of spent time. So, if you play with $ x $ judges with total experience $ y $ you will spend $ x \\cdot y $ seconds.\n\nPrint minimal time to enter to the professional layer or $ -1 $ if it's impossible.",
