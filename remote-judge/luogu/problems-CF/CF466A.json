    "description": "Ann has recently started commuting by subway. We know that a one ride subway ticket costs $ a $ rubles. Besides, Ann found out that she can buy a special ticket for $ m $ rides (she can buy it several times). It costs $ b $ rubles. Ann did the math; she will need to use subway $ n $ times. Help Ann, tell her what is the minimum sum of money she will have to spend to make $ n $ rides?",
    "inputFormat": "The single line contains four space-separated integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ a $ , $ b $ ( $ 1<=n,m,a,b<=1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of rides Ann has planned, the number of rides covered by the $ m $ ride ticket, the price of a one ride ticket and the price of an $ m $ ride ticket.",
    "outputFormat": "Print a single integer \u2014 the minimum sum in rubles that Ann will need to spend.",

    "hint": "In the first sample one of the optimal solutions is: each time buy a one ride ticket. There are other optimal solutions. For example, buy three $ m $ ride tickets.",
