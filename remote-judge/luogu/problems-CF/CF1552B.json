    "description": "The Olympic Games have just started and Federico is eager to watch the marathon race.\n\nThere will be $ n $ athletes, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , competing in the marathon, and all of them have taken part in $ 5 $ important marathons, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ 5 $ , in the past. For each $ 1\\le i\\le n $ and $ 1\\le j\\le 5 $ , Federico remembers that athlete $ i $ ranked $ r_{i,j} $ -th in marathon $ j $ (e.g., $ r_{2,4}=3 $ means that athlete $ 2 $ was third in marathon $ 4 $ ).\n\nFederico considers athlete $ x $ superior to athlete $ y $ if athlete $ x $ ranked better than athlete $ y $ in at least $ 3 $ past marathons, i.e., $ r_{x,j}<r_{y,j} $ for at least $ 3 $ distinct values of $ j $ .\n\nFederico believes that an athlete is likely to get the gold medal at the Olympics if he is superior to all other athletes.\n\nFind any athlete who is likely to get the gold medal (that is, an athlete who is superior to all other athletes), or determine that there is no such athlete.",
