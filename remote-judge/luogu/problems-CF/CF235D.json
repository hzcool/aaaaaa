    "description": "In computer science, there is a method called \"Divide And Conquer By Node\" to solve some hard problems about paths on a tree. Let's desribe how this method works by function:\n\n $ solve(t) $ ( $ t $ is a tree):\n\n1. Chose a node $ x $ (it's common to chose weight-center) in tree $ t $ . Let's call this step \"Line A\".\n2. Deal with all paths that pass $ x $ .\n3. Then delete $ x $ from tree $ t $ .\n4. After that $ t $ becomes some subtrees.\n5. Apply $ solve $ on each subtree.\n\nThis ends when $ t $ has only one node because after deleting it, there's nothing.\n\nNow, WJMZBMR has mistakenly believed that it's ok to chose any node in \"Line A\". So he'll chose a node at random. To make the situation worse, he thinks a \"tree\" should have the same number of edges and nodes! So this procedure becomes like that.\n\nLet's define the variable $ totalCost $ . Initially the value of $ totalCost $ equal to $ 0 $ . So, $ solve(t) $ (now $ t $ is a graph):\n\n1. $ totalCost=totalCost+(size\u00a0of\u00a0t) $ . The operation \"=\" means assignment. $ (Size\u00a0of\u00a0t) $ means the number of nodes in $ t $ .\n2. Choose a node $ x $ in graph $ t $ at random (uniformly among all nodes of $ t $ ).\n3. Then delete $ x $ from graph $ t $ .\n4. After that $ t $ becomes some connected components.\n5. Apply $ solve $ on each component.\n\nHe'll apply $ solve $ on a connected graph with $ n $ nodes and $ n $ edges. He thinks it will work quickly, but it's very slow. So he wants to know the expectation of $ totalCost $ of this procedure. Can you help him?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 3<=n<=3000 $ ) \u2014 the number of nodes and edges in the graph. Each of the next $ n $ lines contains two space-separated integers $ a_{i},b_{i} $ $ (0<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n-1) $ indicating an edge between nodes $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ .\n\nConsider that the graph nodes are numbered from $ 0 $ to $ (n-1) $ . It's guaranteed that there are no self-loops, no multiple edges in that graph. It's guaranteed that the graph is connected.",
