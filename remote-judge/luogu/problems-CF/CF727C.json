    "description": "This is an interactive problem. You should use flush operation after each printed line. For example, in C++ you should use fflush(stdout), in Java you should use System.out.flush(), and in Pascal \u2014 flush(output).\n\nIn this problem you should guess an array $ a $ which is unknown for you. The only information you have initially is the length $ n $ of the array $ a $ .\n\nThe only allowed action is to ask the sum of two elements by their indices. Formally, you can print two indices $ i $ and $ j $ (the indices should be distinct). Then your program should read the response: the single integer equals to $ a_{i}+a_{j} $ .\n\nIt is easy to prove that it is always possible to guess the array using at most $ n $ requests.\n\nWrite a program that will guess the array $ a $ by making at most $ n $ requests.",

    "outputFormat": "In each test your program should guess a single array.\n\nThe input starts with a line containing integer $ n $ ( $ 3<=n<=5000 $ ) \u2014 the length of the array. Your program should read it at first.\n\nAfter that your program should print to the standard output the requests about the sum of two elements or inform that the array is guessed.\n\n- In case your program is making a request to ask the sum of two elements, it should print line in the format \"? i j\" ( $ i $ and $ j $ are distinct integers between $ 1 $ and $ n $ ), where $ i $ and $ j $ are indices in the array $ a $ .\n- In case your program informs that the array is guessed, it should print line in the format \" $ !\u00a0a_{1}\u00a0a_{2}\u00a0...\u00a0a_{n} $ \" (it is guaranteed that all $ a_{i} $ are positive integers not exceeding $ 10^{5} $ ), where $ a_{i} $ is the $ i $ -th element of the array $ a $ .\n\nThe response on a request is a single integer equal to $ a_{i}+a_{j} $ , printed on a separate line.\n\nYour program can do at most $ n $ requests. Note that the final line \u00ab $ !\u00a0a_{1}\u00a0a_{2}\u00a0...\u00a0a_{n} $ \u00bb is not counted as a request.\n\nDo not forget about flush operation after each printed line.\n\nAfter you program prints the guessed array, it should terminate normally.",
