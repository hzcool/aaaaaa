    "description": "Someone give a strange birthday present to Ivan. It is hedgehog \u2014 connected undirected graph in which one vertex has degree at least $ 3 $ (we will call it center) and all other vertices has degree 1. Ivan thought that hedgehog is too boring and decided to make himself $ k $ -multihedgehog.\n\nLet us define $ k $ -multihedgehog as follows:\n\n- $ 1 $ -multihedgehog is hedgehog: it has one vertex of degree at least $ 3 $ and some vertices of degree 1.\n- For all $ k \\ge 2 $ , $ k $ -multihedgehog is $ (k-1) $ -multihedgehog in which the following changes has been made for each vertex $ v $ with degree 1: let $ u $ be its only neighbor; remove vertex $ v $ , create a new hedgehog with center at vertex $ w $ and connect vertices $ u $ and $ w $ with an edge. New hedgehogs can differ from each other and the initial gift.\n\nThereby $ k $ -multihedgehog is a tree. Ivan made $ k $ -multihedgehog but he is not sure that he did not make any mistakes. That is why he asked you to check if his tree is indeed $ k $ -multihedgehog.",
