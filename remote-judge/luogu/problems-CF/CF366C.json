    "description": "Dima, Inna and Seryozha have gathered in a room. That's right, someone's got to go. To cheer Seryozha up and inspire him to have a walk, Inna decided to cook something.\n\nDima and Seryozha have $ n $ fruits in the fridge. Each fruit has two parameters: the taste and the number of calories. Inna decided to make a fruit salad, so she wants to take some fruits from the fridge for it. Inna follows a certain principle as she chooses the fruits: the total taste to the total calories ratio of the chosen fruits must equal $ k $ . In other words, ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF366C/f07d6e1f143f8d1fae686d3a2981d314f5a5105a.png) , where $ a_{j} $ is the taste of the $ j $ -th chosen fruit and $ b_{j} $ is its calories.\n\nInna hasn't chosen the fruits yet, she is thinking: what is the maximum taste of the chosen fruits if she strictly follows her principle? Help Inna solve this culinary problem \u2014 now the happiness of a young couple is in your hands!\n\nInna loves Dima very much so she wants to make the salad from at least one fruit.",

The third line of the input contains $ n $ integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ $ (1<=b_{i}<=100) $ \u2014 the fruits' calories. Fruit number $ i $ has taste $ a_{i} $ and calories $ b_{i} $ .",
