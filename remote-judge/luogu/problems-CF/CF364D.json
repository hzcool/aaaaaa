Please try it, too.",

The second line contains space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=10^{12}) $ . Please note, that given set can contain equal numbers.\n\nPlease, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the %I64d specifier.",
