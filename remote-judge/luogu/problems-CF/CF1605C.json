    "hint": "Consider the first test case. In the substring \"aa\", 'a' occurs twice, while 'b' and 'c' occur zero times. Since 'a' occurs strictly more times than 'b' and 'c', the substring \"aa\" satisfies the condition and the answer is $ 2 $ . The substring \"a\" also satisfies this condition, however its length is not at least $ 2 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that in none of the substrings of \"cbabb\" does 'a' occur strictly more times than 'b' and 'c' each.\n\nIn the third test case, \"cacabccc\", the length of the smallest substring that satisfies the conditions is $ 3 $ .",
