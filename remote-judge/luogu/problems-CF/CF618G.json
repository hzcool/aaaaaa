    "description": "Your friend recently gave you some slimes for your birthday. You have a very large amount of slimes with value $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ , and you decide to invent a game using these slimes.\n\nYou initialize a row with $ n $ empty spaces. You also choose a number $ p $ to be used in the game. Then, you will perform the following steps while the last space is empty.\n\n1. With probability ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF618G/bb27be5e0466e1c87e83bd592f5ebec1f3679c2d.png), you will choose a slime with value $ 1 $ , and with probability ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF618G/c1a5ec97692fc955705c1d6dbdc8e7857800ac46.png), you will choose a slime with value $ 2 $ . You place the chosen slime on the last space of the board.\n2. You will push the slime to the left as far as possible. If it encounters another slime, and they have the same value $ v $ , you will merge the slimes together to create a single slime with value $ v+1 $ . This continues on until the slime reaches the end of the board, or encounters a slime with a different value than itself.\n\nYou have played the game a few times, but have gotten bored of it. You are now wondering, what is the expected sum of all values of the slimes on the board after you finish the game.",
