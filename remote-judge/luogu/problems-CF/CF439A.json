    "description": "Devu is a renowned classical singer. He is invited to many big functions/festivals. Recently he was invited to \"All World Classical Singing Festival\". Other than Devu, comedian Churu was also invited.\n\nDevu has provided organizers a list of the songs and required time for singing them. He will sing $ n $ songs, $ i^{th} $ song will take $ t_{i} $ minutes exactly.\n\nThe Comedian, Churu will crack jokes. All his jokes are of 5 minutes exactly.\n\nPeople have mainly come to listen Devu. But you know that he needs rest of 10 minutes after each song. On the other hand, Churu being a very active person, doesn't need any rest.\n\nYou as one of the organizers should make an optimal s\u0441hedule for the event. For some reasons you must follow the conditions:\n\n- The duration of the event must be no more than $ d $ minutes;\n- Devu must complete all his songs;\n- With satisfying the two previous conditions the number of jokes cracked by Churu should be as many as possible.\n\nIf it is not possible to find a way to conduct all the songs of the Devu, output -1. Otherwise find out maximum number of jokes that Churu can crack in the grand event.",

    "hint": "Consider the first example. The duration of the event is $ 30 $ minutes. There could be maximum $ 5 $ jokes in the following way:\n\n- First Churu cracks a joke in $ 5 $ minutes.\n- Then Devu performs the first song for $ 2 $ minutes.\n- Then Churu cracks $ 2 $ jokes in $ 10 $ minutes.\n- Now Devu performs second song for $ 2 $ minutes.\n- Then Churu cracks $ 2 $ jokes in $ 10 $ minutes.\n- Now finally Devu will perform his last song in $ 1 $ minutes.\n\nTotal time spent is $ 5+2+10+2+10+1=30 $ minutes.\n\nConsider the second example. There is no way of organizing Devu's all songs. Hence the answer is -1.",
