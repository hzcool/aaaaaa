    "description": "You are given a positive integer $ n $ , written without leading zeroes (for example, the number 04 is incorrect).\n\nIn one operation you can delete any digit of the given integer so that the result remains a positive integer without leading zeros.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of operations that you need to consistently apply to the given integer $ n $ to make from it the square of some positive integer or report that it is impossible.\n\nAn integer $ x $ is the square of some positive integer if and only if $ x=y^2 $ for some positive integer $ y $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^{9} $ ). The number is given without leading zeroes.",
    "outputFormat": "If it is impossible to make the square of some positive integer from $ n $ , print -1. In the other case, print the minimal number of operations required to do it.",

After that $ 8314 $ become equals to $ 81 $ , which is the square of the integer $ 9 $ .\n\nIn the second example the given $ 625 $ is the square of the integer $ 25 $ , so you should not delete anything.\n\nIn the third example it is impossible to make the square from $ 333 $ , so the answer is -1.",
