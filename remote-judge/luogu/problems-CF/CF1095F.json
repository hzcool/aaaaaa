    "description": "You are given an undirected graph consisting of $ n $ vertices. A number is written on each vertex; the number on vertex $ i $ is $ a_i $ . Initially there are no edges in the graph.\n\nYou may add some edges to this graph, but you have to pay for them. The cost of adding an edge between vertices $ x $ and $ y $ is $ a_x + a_y $ coins. There are also $ m $ special offers, each of them is denoted by three numbers $ x $ , $ y $ and $ w $ , and means that you can add an edge connecting vertices $ x $ and $ y $ and pay $ w $ coins for it. You don't have to use special offers: if there is a pair of vertices $ x $ and $ y $ that has a special offer associated with it, you still may connect these two vertices paying $ a_x + a_y $ coins for it.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of coins you have to spend to make the graph connected? Recall that a graph is connected if it's possible to get from any vertex to any other vertex using only the edges belonging to this graph.",
