    "description": "You are given an array of $ n $ positive integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ . You can perform the following operation any number of times: select several distinct indices $ i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k $ ( $ 1 \\le i_j \\le n $ ) and move the number standing at the position $ i_1 $ to the position $ i_2 $ , the number at the position $ i_2 $ to the position $ i_3 $ , ..., the number at the position $ i_k $ to the position $ i_1 $ . In other words, the operation cyclically shifts elements: $ i_1 \\to i_2 \\to \\ldots i_k \\to i_1 $ .\n\nFor example, if you have $ n=4 $ , an array $ a_1=10, a_2=20, a_3=30, a_4=40 $ , and you choose three indices $ i_1=2 $ , $ i_2=1 $ , $ i_3=4 $ , then the resulting array would become $ a_1=20, a_2=40, a_3=30, a_4=10 $ .\n\nYour goal is to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order with the minimum number of operations. The additional constraint is that the sum of cycle lengths over all operations should be less than or equal to a number $ s $ . If it's impossible to sort the array while satisfying that constraint, your solution should report that as well.",

    "outputFormat": "If it's impossible to sort the array using cycles of total length not exceeding $ s $ , print a single number \"-1\" (quotes for clarity).\n\nOtherwise, print a single number $ q $ \u2014 the minimum number of operations required to sort the array.\n\nOn the next $ 2 \\cdot q $ lines print descriptions of operations in the order they are applied to the array. The description of $ i $ -th operation begins with a single line containing one integer $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le k \\le n $ )\u2014the length of the cycle (that is, the number of selected indices). The next line should contain $ k $ distinct integers $ i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k $ ( $ 1 \\le i_j \\le n $ )\u2014the indices of the cycle.\n\nThe sum of lengths of these cycles should be less than or equal to $ s $ , and the array should be sorted after applying these $ q $ operations.\n\nIf there are several possible answers with the optimal $ q $ , print any of them.",

    "hint": "In the first example, it's also possible to sort the array with two operations of total length 5: first apply the cycle $ 1 \\to 4 \\to 1 $ (of length 2), then apply the cycle $ 2 \\to 3 \\to 5 \\to 2 $ (of length 3). However, it would be wrong answer as you're asked to use the minimal possible number of operations, which is 1 in that case.\n\nIn the second example, it's possible to the sort the array with two cycles of total length 4 ( $ 1 \\to 2 \\to 1 $ and $ 3 \\to 4 \\to 3 $ ). However, it's impossible to achieve the same using shorter cycles, which is required by $ s=3 $ .\n\nIn the third example, the array is already sorted, so no operations are needed. Total length of empty set of cycles is considered to be zero.",
