    "description": "Petya and Vasya are competing with each other in a new interesting game as they always do.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Petya has to come up with an array of $ N $ positive integers. Sum of all elements in his array should be equal to $ S $ . Then Petya has to select an integer $ K $ such that $ 0 \\leq K \\leq S $ .\n\nIn order to win, Vasya has to find a non-empty subarray in Petya's array such that the sum of all selected elements equals to either $ K $ or $ S - K $ . Otherwise Vasya loses.\n\nYou are given integers $ N $ and $ S $ . You should determine if Petya can win, considering Vasya plays optimally. If Petya can win, help him to do that.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ N $ and $ S $ ( $ 1       \\leq N \\leq S \\leq 10^{6} $ ) \u2014 the required length of the array and the required sum of its elements.",
    "outputFormat": "If Petya can win, print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the first line. Then print Petya's array in the second line. The array should contain $ N $ positive integers with sum equal to $ S $ . In the third line print $ K $ . If there are many correct answers, you can print any of them.\n\nIf Petya can't win, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\nYou can print each letter in any register (lowercase or uppercase).",
