    "description": "Alice got tired of playing the tag game by the usual rules so she offered Bob a little modification to it. Now the game should be played on an undirected rooted tree of $ n $ vertices. Vertex 1 is the root of the tree.\n\nAlice starts at vertex 1 and Bob starts at vertex $ x $ ( $ x\u22601 $ ). The moves are made in turns, Bob goes first. In one move one can either stay at the current vertex or travel to the neighbouring one.\n\nThe game ends when Alice goes to the same vertex where Bob is standing. Alice wants to minimize the total number of moves and Bob wants to maximize it.\n\nYou should write a program which will determine how many moves will the game last.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integer numbers $ n $ and $ x $ ( $ 2<=n<=2\u00b710^{5} $ , $ 2<=x<=n $ ).\n\nEach of the next $ n-1 $ lines contains two integer numbers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1<=a,b<=n $ ) \u2014 edges of the tree. It is guaranteed that the edges form a valid tree.",
