    "description": "Bearland is a big square on the plane. It contains all points with coordinates not exceeding $ 10^{6} $ by the absolute value.\n\nThere are $ n $ houses in Bearland. The $ i $ -th of them is located at the point $ (x_{i},y_{i}) $ . The $ n $ points are distinct, but some subsets of them may be collinear.\n\nBear Limak lives in the first house. He wants to destroy his house and build a new one somewhere in Bearland.\n\nBears don't like big changes. For every three points (houses) $ p_{i} $ , $ p_{j} $ and $ p_{k} $ , the sign of their cross product $ (p_{j}-p_{i})\u00d7(p_{k}-p_{i}) $ should be the same before and after the relocation. If it was negative/positive/zero, it should still be negative/positive/zero respectively. This condition should be satisfied for all triples of indices $ (i,j,k) $ , possibly equal to each other or different than $ 1 $ . Additionally, Limak isn't allowed to build the house at the point where some other house already exists (but it can be the point where his old house was).\n\nIn the formula above, we define the difference and the cross product of points $ (a_{x},a_{y}) $ and $ (b_{x},b_{y}) $ as:\n\n $ (a_{x},a_{y})-(b_{x},b_{y})=(a_{x}-b_{x},a_{y}-b_{y}), $   $ (a_{x},a_{y})\u00d7(b_{x},b_{y})=a_{x}\u00b7b_{y}-a_{y}\u00b7b_{x}. $ Consider a set of possible new placements of Limak's house. Your task is to find the area of that set of points.\n\nFormally, let's say that Limak chooses the new placement randomly (each coordinate is chosen independently uniformly at random from the interval $ [-10^{6},10^{6}] $ ). Let $ p $ denote the probability of getting the allowed placement of new house. Let $ S $ denote the area of Bearland ( $ S=4\u00b710^{12} $ ). Your task is to find $ p\u00b7S $ .",

The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of the description of a test case contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 3<=n<=200000 $ ) \u2014 the number of houses.\n\nThe $ i $ -th of the next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ -10^{6}<=x_{i},y_{i}<=10^{6} $ ) \u2014 coordinates of the $ i $ -th house. No two houses are located at the same point in the same test case. Limak lives in the first house.\n\nThe sum of $ n $ won't exceed $ 200000 $ .",

    "hint": "In the sample test, there are $ 4 $ test cases.\n\nIn the first test case, there are four houses and Limak's one is in $ (5,3) $ . The set of valid new placements form a triangle with vertices in points $ (0,1) $ , $ (10,1) $ and $ (3,51) $ , without its sides. The area of such a triangle is $ 250 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, the set of valid new placements form a rectangle of width $ 50000 $ and height $ 2000000 $ . Don't forget that the new placement must be inside the big square that represents Bearland.\n\nIn the third test case, the three given points are collinear. Each cross product is equal to $ 0 $ and it should be $ 0 $ after the relocation as well. Hence, Limak's new house must lie on the line that goes through the given points. Since it must also be inside the big square, new possible placements are limited to some segment (excluding the two points where the other houses are). The area of any segment is $ 0 $ .",
