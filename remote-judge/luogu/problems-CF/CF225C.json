    "description": "You've got an $ n\u00d7m $ pixel picture. Each pixel can be white or black. Your task is to change the colors of as few pixels as possible to obtain a barcode picture.\n\nA picture is a barcode if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n- All pixels in each column are of the same color.\n- The width of each monochrome vertical line is at least $ x $ and at most $ y $ pixels. In other words, if we group all neighbouring columns of the pixels with equal color, the size of each group can not be less than $ x $ or greater than $ y $ .",

Each of these lines contains exactly $ m $ characters. Character \".\" represents a white pixel and \"\\#\" represents a black pixel. The picture description doesn't have any other characters besides \".\" and \"\\#\".",
