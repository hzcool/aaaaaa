    "description": "Vasya has an array of integers of length $ n $ .\n\nVasya performs the following operations on the array: on each step he finds the longest segment of consecutive equal integers (the leftmost, if there are several such segments) and removes it. For example, if Vasya's array is $ [13,13,7,7,7,2,2,2] $ , then after one operation it becomes $ [13,13,2,2,2] $ .\n\nCompute the number of operations Vasya should make until the array becomes empty, i.e. Vasya removes all elements from it.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=200000 $ ) \u2014 the length of the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 Vasya's array.",

    "hint": "In the first example, at first Vasya removes two fives at the second and third positions. The array becomes $ [2,2] $ . In the second operation Vasya removes two twos at the first and second positions. After that the array becomes empty.\n\nIn the second example Vasya has to perform five operations to make the array empty. In each of them he removes the first element from the array.\n\nIn the third example Vasya needs three operations. In the first operation he removes all integers $ 4 $ , in the second \u2014 all integers $ 100 $ , in the third \u2014 all integers $ 2 $ .\n\nIn the fourth example in the first operation Vasya removes the first two integers $ 10 $ . After that the array becomes $ [50,10,50,50] $ . Then in the second operation Vasya removes the two rightmost integers $ 50 $ , so that the array becomes $ [50,10] $ . In the third operation he removes the remaining $ 50 $ , and the array becomes $ [10] $ after that. In the last, fourth operation he removes the only remaining $ 10 $ . The array is empty after that.",
