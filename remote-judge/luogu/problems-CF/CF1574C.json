    "description": "Recently, Petya learned about a new game \"Slay the Dragon\". As the name suggests, the player will have to fight with dragons. To defeat a dragon, you have to kill it and defend your castle. To do this, the player has a squad of $ n $ heroes, the strength of the $ i $ -th hero is equal to $ a_i $ .\n\nAccording to the rules of the game, exactly one hero should go kill the dragon, all the others will defend the castle. If the dragon's defense is equal to $ x $ , then you have to send a hero with a strength of at least $ x $ to kill it. If the dragon's attack power is $ y $ , then the total strength of the heroes defending the castle should be at least $ y $ .\n\nThe player can increase the strength of any hero by $ 1 $ for one gold coin. This operation can be done any number of times.\n\nThere are $ m $ dragons in the game, the $ i $ -th of them has defense equal to $ x_i $ and attack power equal to $ y_i $ . Petya was wondering what is the minimum number of coins he needs to spend to defeat the $ i $ -th dragon.\n\nNote that the task is solved independently for each dragon (improvements are not saved).",

To kill the dragon, you can choose a second hero.\n\nTo defeat the third dragon, you can increase the strength of all the heroes by $ 1 $ , then the strength of the heroes will be equal to $ [4, 7, 3, 4] $ . To kill the dragon, you can choose a fourth hero.\n\nTo defeat the fourth dragon, you don't need to improve the heroes and choose a third hero to kill the dragon.\n\nTo defeat the fifth dragon, you can increase the strength of the second hero by $ 2 $ , then the strength of the heroes will be equal to $ [3, 8, 2, 3] $ . To kill the dragon, you can choose a second hero.",
