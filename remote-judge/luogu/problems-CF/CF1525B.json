    "description": "You are given a permutation $ a $ consisting of $ n $ numbers $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , ..., $ n $ (a permutation is an array in which each element from $ 1 $ to $ n $ occurs exactly once).\n\nYou can perform the following operation: choose some subarray (contiguous subsegment) of $ a $ and rearrange the elements in it in any way you want. But this operation cannot be applied to the whole array.\n\nFor example, if $ a = [2, 1, 4, 5, 3] $ and we want to apply the operation to the subarray $ a[2, 4] $ (the subarray containing all elements from the $ 2 $ -nd to the $ 4 $ -th), then after the operation, the array can become $ a = [2, 5, 1, 4, 3] $ or, for example, $ a = [2, 1, 5, 4, 3] $ .\n\nYour task is to calculate the minimum number of operations described above to sort the permutation $ a $ in ascending order.",
