    "description": "PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: \"There exists such a positive integer $ n $ that for each positive integer $ m $ number $ n\u00b7m+1 $ is a prime number\".\n\nUnfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any $ n $ .",

    "outputFormat": "Output such $ m $ that $ n\u00b7m+1 $ is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable $ m $ such that $ 1<=m<=10^{3} $ . It is guaranteed the the answer exists.",

    "hint": "A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than $ 1 $ that has no positive divisors other than $ 1 $ and itself.\n\nFor the first sample testcase, $ 3\u00b71+1=4 $ . We can output $ 1 $ .\n\nIn the second sample testcase, $ 4\u00b71+1=5 $ . We cannot output $ 1 $ because $ 5 $ is prime. However, $ m=2 $ is okay since $ 4\u00b72+1=9 $ , which is not a prime number.",
