    "description": "Vasya, like many others, likes to participate in a variety of sweepstakes and lotteries. Now he collects wrappings from a famous chocolate bar \"Jupiter\". According to the sweepstake rules, each wrapping has an integer written on it \u2014 the number of points that the participant adds to his score as he buys the bar. After a participant earns a certain number of points, he can come to the prize distribution center and exchange the points for prizes. When somebody takes a prize, the prize's cost is simply subtracted from the number of his points.\n\nVasya didn't only bought the bars, he also kept a record of how many points each wrapping cost. Also, he remembers that he always stucks to the greedy strategy \u2014 as soon as he could take at least one prize, he went to the prize distribution centre and exchanged the points for prizes. Moreover, if he could choose between multiple prizes, he chose the most expensive one. If after an exchange Vasya had enough points left to get at least one more prize, then he continued to exchange points.\n\nThe sweepstake has the following prizes (the prizes are sorted by increasing of their cost):\n\n- a mug (costs $ a $ points),\n- a towel (costs $ b $ points),\n- a bag (costs $ c $ points),\n- a bicycle (costs $ d $ points),\n- a car (costs $ e $ points).\n\nNow Vasya wants to recollect what prizes he has received. You know sequence $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ , where $ p_{i} $ is the number of points Vasya got for the $ i $ -th bar. The sequence of points is given in the chronological order. You also know numbers $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ , $ d $ , $ e $ . Your task is to find, how many prizes Vasya received, what prizes they are and how many points he's got left after all operations are completed.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=50 $ ) \u2014 the number of chocolate bar wrappings that brought points to Vasya. The second line contains space-separated integers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i}<=10^{9} $ ). The third line contains 5 integers $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ , $ d $ , $ e $ ( $ 1<=a&lt;b&lt;c&lt;d&lt;e<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the prizes' costs.",
