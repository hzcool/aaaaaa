    "description": "Phoenix has collected $ n $ pieces of gold, and he wants to weigh them together so he can feel rich. The $ i $ -th piece of gold has weight $ w_i $ . All weights are distinct. He will put his $ n $ pieces of gold on a weight scale, one piece at a time.\n\nThe scale has an unusual defect: if the total weight on it is exactly $ x $ , it will explode. Can he put all $ n $ gold pieces onto the scale in some order, without the scale exploding during the process? If so, help him find some possible order.\n\nFormally, rearrange the array $ w $ so that for each $ i $ $ (1 \\le i \\le n) $ , $ \\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{i}w_j \\ne x $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ x $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 100 $ ; $ 1 \\le x \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of gold pieces that Phoenix has and the weight to avoid, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ (1 \\le w_i \\le 100) $ \u2014 the weights of the gold pieces. It is guaranteed that the weights are pairwise distinct.",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, if Phoenix cannot place all $ n $ pieces without the scale exploding, print NO. Otherwise, print YES followed by the rearranged array $ w $ . If there are multiple solutions, print any.",

The total weight on the scale is $ 3 $ , then $ 5 $ , then $ 6 $ . The scale does not explode because the total weight on the scale is never $ 2 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, the total weight on the scale is $ 8 $ , $ 9 $ , $ 11 $ , $ 14 $ , then $ 18 $ . It is never $ 3 $ .\n\nIn the third test case, Phoenix must put the gold piece with weight $ 5 $ on the scale, and the scale will always explode.",
