    "description": "The Little Girl loves problems on games very much. Here's one of them.\n\nTwo players have got a string $ s $ , consisting of lowercase English letters. They play a game that is described by the following rules:\n\n- The players move in turns; In one move the player can remove an arbitrary letter from string $ s $ .\n- If the player before his turn can reorder the letters in string $ s $ so as to get a palindrome, this player wins. A palindrome is a string that reads the same both ways (from left to right, and vice versa). For example, string \"abba\" is a palindrome and string \"abc\" isn't.\n\nDetermine which player will win, provided that both sides play optimally well \u2014 the one who moves first or the one who moves second.",
    "inputFormat": "The input contains a single line, containing string $ s $ ( $ 1<=|s|<=10^{3} $ ). String $ s $ consists of lowercase English letters.",
    "outputFormat": "In a single line print word \"First\" if the first player wins (provided that both players play optimally well). Otherwise, print word \"Second\". Print the words without the quotes.",
