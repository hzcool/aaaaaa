    "description": "Coming up with a new problem isn't as easy as many people think. Sometimes it is hard enough to name it. We'll consider a title original if it doesn't occur as a substring in any titles of recent Codeforces problems.\n\nYou've got the titles of $ n $ last problems \u2014 the strings, consisting of lowercase English letters. Your task is to find the shortest original title for the new problem. If there are multiple such titles, choose the lexicographically minimum one. Note, that title of the problem can't be an empty string.\n\nA substring $ s[l...\\ r] $ $ (1<=l<=r<=|s|) $ of string $ s=s_{1}s_{2}...\\ s_{|s|} $ (where $ |s| $ is the length of string $ s $ ) is string $ s_{l}s_{l+1}...\\ s_{r} $ .\n\nString $ x=x_{1}x_{2}...\\ x_{p} $ is lexicographically smaller than string $ y=y_{1}y_{2}...\\ y_{q} $ , if either $ p&lt;q $ and $ x_{1}=y_{1},x_{2}=y_{2},...\\ ,x_{p}=y_{p} $ , or there exists such number $ r $ $ (r&lt;p,r&lt;q) $ , that $ x_{1}=y_{1},x_{2}=y_{2},...\\ ,x_{r}=y_{r} $ and $ x_{r+1}&lt;y_{r+1} $ .
