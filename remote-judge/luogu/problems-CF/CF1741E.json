    "description": "The sequence $ a $ is sent over the network as follows:\n\n1. sequence $ a $ is split into segments (each element of the sequence belongs to exactly one segment, each segment is a group of consecutive elements of sequence);\n2. for each segment, its length is written next to it, either to the left of it or to the right of it;\n3. the resulting sequence $ b $ is sent over the network.\n\nFor example, we needed to send the sequence $ a = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3] $ . Suppose it was split into segments as follows: $ [\\color{red}{1}] + [\\color{blue}{2, 3, 1}] + [\\color{green}{2, 3}] $ . Then we could have the following sequences:\n\n- $ b = [1, \\color{red}{1}, 3, \\color{blue}{2, 3, 1}, \\color{green}{2, 3}, 2] $ ,\n- $ b = [\\color{red}{1}, 1, 3, \\color{blue}{2, 3, 1}, 2, \\color{green}{2, 3}] $ ,\n- $ b = [\\color{red}{1}, 1, \\color{blue}{2, 3, 1}, 3, 2, \\color{green}{2, 3}] $ ,\n- $ b = [\\color{red}{1}, 1,\\color{blue}{2, 3, 1}, 3, \\color{green}{2, 3}, 2] $ .\n\nIf a different segmentation had been used, the sent sequence might have been different.\n\nThe sequence $ b $ is given. Could the sequence $ b $ be sent over the network? In other words, is there such a sequence $ a $ that converting $ a $ to send it over the network could result in a sequence $ b $ ?",
