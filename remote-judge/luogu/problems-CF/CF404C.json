    "description": "Valera had an undirected connected graph without self-loops and multiple edges consisting of $ n $ vertices. The graph had an interesting property: there were at most $ k $ edges adjacent to each of its vertices. For convenience, we will assume that the graph vertices were indexed by integers from 1 to $ n $ .\n\nOne day Valera counted the shortest distances from one of the graph vertices to all other ones and wrote them out in array $ d $ . Thus, element $ d[i] $ of the array shows the shortest distance from the vertex Valera chose to vertex number $ i $ .\n\nThen something irreparable terrible happened. Valera lost the initial graph. However, he still has the array $ d $ . Help him restore the lost graph.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ k $ $ (1<=k<n<=10^{5}) $ . Number $ n $ shows the number of vertices in the original graph. Number $ k $ shows that at most $ k $ edges were adjacent to each vertex in the original graph.\n\nThe second line contains space-separated integers $ d[1],d[2],...,d[n] $ $ (0<=d[i]<n) $ . Number $ d[i] $ shows the shortest distance from the vertex Valera chose to the vertex number $ i $ .",
    "outputFormat": "If Valera made a mistake in his notes and the required graph doesn't exist, print in the first line number -1. Otherwise, in the first line print integer $ m $ $ (0<=m<=10^{6}) $ \u2014 the number of edges in the found graph.\n\nIn each of the next $ m $ lines print two space-separated integers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ $ (1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n;\u00a0a_{i}\u2260b_{i}) $ , denoting the edge that connects vertices with numbers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ . The graph shouldn't contain self-loops and multiple edges. If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.",
