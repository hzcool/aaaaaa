    "description": "A non-empty digit string is diverse if the number of occurrences of each character in it doesn't exceed the number of distinct characters in it.\n\nFor example:\n\n- string \"7\" is diverse because 7 appears in it $ 1 $ time and the number of distinct characters in it is $ 1 $ ;\n- string \"77\" is not diverse because 7 appears in it $ 2 $ times and the number of distinct characters in it is $ 1 $ ;\n- string \"1010\" is diverse because both 0 and 1 appear in it $ 2 $ times and the number of distinct characters in it is $ 2 $ ;\n- string \"6668\" is not diverse because 6 appears in it $ 3 $ times and the number of distinct characters in it is $ 2 $ .\n\nYou are given a string $ s $ of length $ n $ , consisting of only digits $ 0 $ to $ 9 $ . Find how many of its $ \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} $ substrings are diverse.\n\nA string $ a $ is a substring of a string $ b $ if $ a $ can be obtained from $ b $ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.\n\nNote that if the same diverse string appears in $ s $ multiple times, each occurrence should be counted independently. For example, there are two diverse substrings in \"77\" both equal to \"7\", so the answer for the string \"77\" is $ 2 $ .",
