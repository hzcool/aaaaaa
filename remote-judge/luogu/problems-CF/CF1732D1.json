    "description": "This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version there are no \"remove\" queries.\n\nInitially you have a set containing one element \u2014 $ 0 $ . You need to handle $ q $ queries of the following types:\n\n- + $ x $ \u2014 add the integer $ x $ to the set. It is guaranteed that this integer is not contained in the set;\n- ? $ k $ \u2014 find the $ k\\text{-mex} $ of the set.\n\nIn our problem, we define the $ k\\text{-mex} $ of a set of integers as the smallest non-negative integer $ x $ that is divisible by $ k $ and which is not contained in the set.",

It is guaranteed that $ x $ was not contained in the set.\n\nA search query of $ k\\text{-mex} $ is given in the format ? $ k $ ( $ 1 \\leq k \\leq 10^{18} $ ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that there will be at least one query of type ?.",
