    "description": "You are given a string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ characters. Each character of $ s $ is either 0 or 1.\n\nA substring of $ s $ is a contiguous subsequence of its characters.\n\nYou have to choose two substrings of $ s $ (possibly intersecting, possibly the same, possibly non-intersecting \u2014 just any two substrings). After choosing them, you calculate the value of the chosen pair of substrings as follows:\n\n- let $ s_1 $ be the first substring, $ s_2 $ be the second chosen substring, and $ f(s_i) $ be the integer such that $ s_i $ is its binary representation (for example, if $ s_i $ is 11010, $ f(s_i) = 26 $ );\n- the value is the bitwise OR of $ f(s_1) $ and $ f(s_2) $ .\n\nCalculate the maximum possible value you can get, and print it in binary representation without leading zeroes.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ n $ \u2014 the number of characters in $ s $ .\n\nThe second line contains $ s $ itself, consisting of exactly $ n $ characters 0 and/or 1.\n\nAll non-example tests in this problem are generated randomly: every character of $ s $ is chosen independently of other characters; for each character, the probability of it being 1 is exactly $ \\frac{1}{2} $ .\n\nThis problem has exactly $ 40 $ tests. Tests from $ 1 $ to $ 3 $ are the examples; tests from $ 4 $ to $ 40 $ are generated randomly. In tests from $ 4 $ to $ 10 $ , $ n = 5 $ ; in tests from $ 11 $ to $ 20 $ , $ n = 1000 $ ; in tests from $ 21 $ to $ 40 $ , $ n = 10^6 $ .\n\nHacks are forbidden in this problem.",
