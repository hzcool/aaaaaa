    "description": "As the name of the task implies, you are asked to do some work with segments and trees.\n\nRecall that a tree is a connected undirected graph such that there is exactly one simple path between every pair of its vertices.\n\nYou are given $ n $ segments $ [l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \\dots, [l_n, r_n] $ , $ l_i < r_i $ for every $ i $ . It is guaranteed that all segments' endpoints are integers, and all endpoints are unique \u2014 there is no pair of segments such that they start in the same point, end in the same point or one starts in the same point the other one ends.\n\nLet's generate a graph with $ n $ vertices from these segments. Vertices $ v $ and $ u $ are connected by an edge if and only if segments $ [l_v, r_v] $ and $ [l_u, r_u] $ intersect and neither of it lies fully inside the other one.\n\nFor example, pairs $ ([1, 3], [2, 4]) $ and $ ([5, 10], [3, 7]) $ will induce the edges but pairs $ ([1, 2], [3, 4]) $ and $ ([5, 7], [3, 10]) $ will not.\n\nDetermine if the resulting graph is a tree or not.",
