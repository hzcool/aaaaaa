    "description": "Iahub wants to meet his girlfriend Iahubina. They both live in $ Ox $ axis (the horizontal axis). Iahub lives at point 0 and Iahubina at point $ d $ .\n\nIahub has $ n $ positive integers $ a_{1} $ , $ a_{2} $ , ..., $ a_{n} $ . The sum of those numbers is $ d $ . Suppose $ p_{1} $ , $ p_{2} $ , ..., $ p_{n} $ is a permutation of $ {1,2,...,n} $ . Then, let $ b_{1}=a_{p1} $ , $ b_{2}=a_{p2} $ and so on. The array b is called a \"route\". There are $ n! $ different routes, one for each permutation $ p $ .\n\nIahub's travel schedule is: he walks $ b_{1} $ steps on $ Ox $ axis, then he makes a break in point $ b_{1} $ . Then, he walks $ b_{2} $ more steps on $ Ox $ axis and makes a break in point $ b_{1}+b_{2} $ . Similarly, at $ j $ -th $ (1<=j<=n) $ time he walks $ b_{j} $ more steps on $ Ox $ axis and makes a break in point $ b_{1}+b_{2}+...+b_{j} $ .\n\nIahub is very superstitious and has $ k $ integers which give him bad luck. He calls a route \"good\" if he never makes a break in a point corresponding to one of those $ k $ numbers. For his own curiosity, answer how many good routes he can make, modulo $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ).",

Iahub will stop at position 2, 7 and 10. Among them, 7 is bad luck for him.\n- \\[3, 2, 5\\]. He will stop at the unlucky 5.\n- \\[3, 5, 2\\]. This is a valid ordering.\n- \\[5, 2, 3\\]. He got unlucky twice (5 and 7).\n- \\[5, 3, 2\\].

In fact, all six possible ways have the same stops: \\[2, 4, 6\\], so there's no bad luck for Iahub.",
