    "description": "You are given a bracket sequence $ s $ of length $ n $ , where $ n $ is even (divisible by two). The string $ s $ consists of $ \\frac{n}{2} $ opening brackets '(' and $ \\frac{n}{2} $ closing brackets ')'.\n\nIn one move, you can choose exactly one bracket and move it to the beginning of the string or to the end of the string (i.e. you choose some index $ i $ , remove the $ i $ -th character of $ s $ and insert it before or after all remaining characters of $ s $ ).\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain regular bracket sequence from $ s $ . It can be proved that the answer always exists under the given constraints.\n\nRecall what the regular bracket sequence is:\n\n- \"()\" is regular bracket sequence;\n- if $ s $ is regular bracket sequence then \"(\" + $ s $ + \")\" is regular bracket sequence;\n- if $ s $ and $ t $ are regular bracket sequences then $ s $ + $ t $ is regular bracket sequence.\n\nFor example, \"()()\", \"(())()\", \"(())\" and \"()\" are regular bracket sequences, but \")(\", \"()(\" and \")))\" are not.\n\nYou have to answer $ t $ independent test cases.",
