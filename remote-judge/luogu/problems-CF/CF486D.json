    "description": "As you know, an undirected connected graph with $ n $ nodes and $ n-1 $ edges is called a tree. You are given an integer $ d $ and a tree consisting of $ n $ nodes. Each node $ i $ has a value $ a_{i} $ associated with it.\n\nWe call a set $ S $ of tree nodes valid if following conditions are satisfied:\n\n1. $ S $ is non-empty.\n2. $ S $ is connected. In other words, if nodes $ u $ and $ v $ are in $ S $ , then all nodes lying on the simple path between $ u $ and $ v $ should also be presented in $ S $ .\n3. ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF486D/178986cc3145e106df7e442d141768e61c090be6.png).\n\nYour task is to count the number of valid sets. Since the result can be very large, you must print its remainder modulo $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ).",
