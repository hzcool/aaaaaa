    "description": "Childan is making up a legendary story and trying to sell his forgery \u2014 a necklace with a strong sense of \"Wu\" to the Kasouras. But Mr. Kasoura is challenging the truth of Childan's story. So he is going to ask a few questions about Childan's so-called \"personal treasure\" necklace.\n\nThis \"personal treasure\" is a multiset $ S $ of $ m $ \"01-strings\".\n\nA \"01-string\" is a string that contains $ n $ characters \"0\" and \"1\". For example, if $ n=4 $ , strings \"0110\", \"0000\", and \"1110\" are \"01-strings\", but \"00110\" (there are $ 5 $ characters, not $ 4 $ ) and \"zero\" (unallowed characters) are not.\n\nNote that the multiset $ S $ can contain equal elements.\n\nFrequently, Mr. Kasoura will provide a \"01-string\" $ t $ and ask Childan how many strings $ s $ are in the multiset $ S $ such that the \"Wu\" value of the pair $ (s, t) $ is not greater than $ k $ .\n\nMrs. Kasoura and Mr. Kasoura think that if $ s_i = t_i $ ( $ 1\\leq i\\leq n $ ) then the \"Wu\" value of the character pair equals to $ w_i $ , otherwise $ 0 $ . The \"Wu\" value of the \"01-string\" pair is the sum of the \"Wu\" values of every character pair. Note that the length of every \"01-string\" is equal to $ n $ .\n\nFor example, if $ w=[4, 5, 3, 6] $ , \"Wu\" of (\"1001\", \"1100\") is $ 7 $ because these strings have equal characters only on the first and third positions, so $ w_1+w_3=4+3=7 $ .\n\nYou need to help Childan to answer Mr. Kasoura's queries. That is to find the number of strings in the multiset $ S $ such that the \"Wu\" value of the pair is not greater than $ k $ .",
