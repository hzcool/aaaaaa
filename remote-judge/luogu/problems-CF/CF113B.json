    "description": "Long ago, when Petya was a schoolboy, he was very much interested in the Petr# language grammar. During one lesson Petya got interested in the following question: how many different continuous substrings starting with the $ s_{begin} $ and ending with the $ s_{end} $ (it is possible $ s_{begin}=s_{end} $ ), the given string $ t $ has. Substrings are different if and only if their contents aren't equal, their positions of occurence don't matter. Petya wasn't quite good at math, that's why he couldn't count this number. Help him!",
    "inputFormat": "The input file consists of three lines. The first line contains string $ t $ . The second and the third lines contain the $ s_{begin} $ and $ s_{end} $ identificators, correspondingly. All three lines are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of each string doesn't exceed 2000 characters.",
    "outputFormat": "Output the only number \u2014 the amount of different substrings of $ t $ that start with $ s_{begin} $ and end with $ s_{end} $ .",
