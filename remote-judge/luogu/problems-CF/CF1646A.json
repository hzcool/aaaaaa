    "description": "Luis has a sequence of $ n+1 $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n+1} $ . For each $ i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n+1 $ it is guaranteed that $ 0\\leq a_i < n $ , or $ a_i=n^2 $ . He has calculated the sum of all the elements of the sequence, and called this value $ s $ .\n\nLuis has lost his sequence, but he remembers the values of $ n $ and $ s $ . Can you find the number of elements in the sequence that are equal to $ n^2 $ ?\n\nWe can show that the answer is unique under the given constraints.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 2\\cdot 10^4 $ ). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ s $ ( $ 1\\le n< 10^6 $ , $ 0\\le s \\le 10^{18} $ ). It is guaranteed that the value of $ s $ is a valid sum for some sequence satisfying the above constraints.",

    "hint": "In the first test case, we have $ s=0 $ so all numbers are equal to $ 0 $ and there isn't any number equal to $ 49 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, we have $ s=1 $ . There are two possible sequences: $ [0, 1] $ or $ [1, 0] $ . In both cases, the number $ 1 $ appears just once.\n\nIn the third test case, we have $ s=12 $ , which is the maximum possible value of $ s $ for this case. Thus, the number $ 4 $ appears $ 3 $ times in the sequence.",
