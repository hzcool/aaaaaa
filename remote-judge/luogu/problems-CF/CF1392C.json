    "description": "Omkar is building a waterslide in his water park, and he needs your help to ensure that he does it as efficiently as possible.\n\nOmkar currently has $ n $ supports arranged in a line, the $ i $ -th of which has height $ a_i $ . Omkar wants to build his waterslide from the right to the left, so his supports must be nondecreasing in height in order to support the waterslide. In $ 1 $ operation, Omkar can do the following: take any contiguous subsegment of supports which is nondecreasing by heights and add $ 1 $ to each of their heights.\n\nHelp Omkar find the minimum number of operations he needs to perform to make his supports able to support his waterslide!\n\nAn array $ b $ is a subsegment of an array $ c $ if $ b $ can be obtained from $ c $ by deletion of several (possibly zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly zero or all) elements from the end.\n\nAn array $ b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n $ is called nondecreasing if $ b_i\\le b_{i+1} $ for every $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n-1 $ .",
