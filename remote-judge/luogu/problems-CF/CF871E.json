    "description": "Petya had a tree consisting of $ n $ vertices numbered with integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Accidentally he lost his tree.\n\nPetya remembers information about $ k $ vertices: distances from each of them to each of the $ n $ tree vertices.\n\nYour task is to restore any tree that satisfies the information that Petya remembers or report that such tree doesn't exist.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 2<=n<=30000 $ , $ 1<=k<=min(200,n) $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree and the number of vertices about which Petya remembers distance information.\n\nThe following $ k $ lines contain remembered information. The $ i $ -th line contains $ n $ integers $ d_{i,1},d_{i,2},...,d_{i,n} $ ( $ 0<=d_{i,j}<=n-1 $ ), where $ d_{i,j} $ \u2014 the distance to $ j $ -th vertex from the $ i $ -th vertex that Petya remembers.",
    "outputFormat": "If there are no suitable trees, print -1.\n\nIn the other case, print $ n-1 $ lines: each line should contain two vertices connected by edge in the required tree. You can print edges and vertices in an edge in any order. The tree vertices are enumerated from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .\n\nIf there are many solutions print any of them.",
