Today Victor wants to find a set of integers $ S $ that has the following properties:\n\n- for all $ x $ ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF460D/26c8948a606517ebae5f50ff9b8fc7d91f76f3df.png) the following inequality holds $ l<=x<=r $ ;\n- $ 1<=|S|<=k $ ;\n- lets denote the $ i $ -th element of the set $ S $ as $ s_{i} $ ; value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF460D/7523823a9f324064de1df35c0e0503740f7be786.png) must be as small as possible.\n\nHelp Victor find the described set.",
