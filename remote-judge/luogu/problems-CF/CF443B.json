    "description": "Kolya got string $ s $ for his birthday, the string consists of small English letters. He immediately added $ k $ more characters to the right of the string.\n\nThen Borya came and said that the new string contained a tandem repeat of length $ l $ as a substring. How large could $ l $ be?\n\nSee notes for definition of a tandem repeat.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains $ s $ ( $ 1<=|s|<=200 $ ). This string contains only small English letters. The second line contains number $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=200 $ ) \u2014 the number of the added characters.",
    "outputFormat": "Print a single number \u2014 the maximum length of the tandem repeat that could have occurred in the new string.",

        [
            "aaba\n2\n",

    "hint": "A tandem repeat of length $ 2n $ is string $ s $ , where for any position $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) the following condition fulfills: $ s_{i}=s_{i+n} $ .\n\nIn the first sample Kolya could obtain a string aabaab, in the second \u2014 aaabbbbbb, in the third \u2014 abracadabrabracadabra."
