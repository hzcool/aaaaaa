    "description": "Iahub recently has learned Bubble Sort, an algorithm that is used to sort a permutation with $ n $ elements $ a_{1} $ , $ a_{2} $ , ..., $ a_{n} $ in ascending order. He is bored of this so simple algorithm, so he invents his own graph. The graph (let's call it $ G $ ) initially has $ n $ vertices and 0 edges. During Bubble Sort execution, edges appear as described in the following algorithm (pseudocode).\n\n`<br></br>procedure bubbleSortGraph()<br></br>    build a graph G with n vertices and 0 edges<br></br>    repeat<br></br>        swapped = false<br></br>        for i = 1 to n - 1 inclusive do:<br></br>            if a[i] > a[i + 1] then<br></br>                add an undirected edge in G between a[i] and a[i + 1]<br></br>                swap( a[i], a[i + 1] )<br></br>                swapped = true<br></br>            end if<br></br>        end for<br></br>    until not swapped <br></br>    /* repeat the algorithm as long as swapped value is true. */ <br></br>end procedure<br></br>`For a graph, an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent (so there are no edges between vertices of an independent set). A maximum independent set is an independent set which has maximum cardinality. Given the permutation, find the size of the maximum independent set of graph $ G $ , if we use such permutation as the premutation $ a $ in procedure bubbleSortGraph.",

    "hint": "Consider the first example. Bubble sort swaps elements 3 and 1. We add edge (1, 3). Permutation is now \\[1, 3, 2\\]. Then bubble sort swaps elements 3 and 2. We add edge (2, 3). Permutation is now sorted. We have a graph with 3 vertices and 2 edges (1, 3) and (2, 3). Its maximal independent set is \\[1, 2\\].",
