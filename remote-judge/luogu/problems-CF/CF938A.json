    "description": "Victor tries to write his own text editor, with word correction included. However, the rules of word correction are really strange.\n\nVictor thinks that if a word contains two consecutive vowels, then it's kinda weird and it needs to be replaced. So the word corrector works in such a way: as long as there are two consecutive vowels in the word, it deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it. If there are no two consecutive vowels in the word, it is considered to be correct.\n\nYou are given a word $ s $ . Can you predict what will it become after correction?\n\nIn this problem letters a, e, i, o, u and y are considered to be vowels.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) \u2014 the number of letters in word $ s $ before the correction.\n\nThe second line contains a string $ s $ consisting of exactly $ n $ lowercase Latin letters \u2014 the word before the correction.",
    "outputFormat": "Output the word $ s $ after the correction.",
