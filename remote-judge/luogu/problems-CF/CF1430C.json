    "description": "Numbers $ 1, 2, 3, \\dots n $ (each integer from $ 1 $ to $ n $ once) are written on a board. In one operation you can erase any two numbers $ a $ and $ b $ from the board and write one integer $ \\frac{a + b}{2} $ rounded up instead.\n\nYou should perform the given operation $ n - 1 $ times and make the resulting number that will be left on the board as small as possible.\n\nFor example, if $ n = 4 $ , the following course of action is optimal:\n\n1. choose $ a = 4 $ and $ b = 2 $ , so the new number is $ 3 $ , and the whiteboard contains $ [1, 3, 3] $ ;\n2. choose $ a = 3 $ and $ b = 3 $ , so the new number is $ 3 $ , and the whiteboard contains $ [1, 3] $ ;\n3. choose $ a = 1 $ and $ b = 3 $ , so the new number is $ 2 $ , and the whiteboard contains $ [2] $ .\n\nIt's easy to see that after $ n - 1 $ operations, there will be left only one number. Your goal is to minimize it.",
