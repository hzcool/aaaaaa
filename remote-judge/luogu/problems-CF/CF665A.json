Simion doesn't count the buses he meet at the start and finish.\n\nYou know the time when Simion departed from the city $ A $ to the city $ B $ . Calculate the number of buses Simion will meet to be sure in his counting.",

Both values are given in minutes.\n\nThe last line contains the departure time of Simion from the city $ A $ in the format hh:mm.
