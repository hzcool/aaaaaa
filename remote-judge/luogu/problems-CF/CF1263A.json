She is free to choose the colors of eaten candies: the only restriction that she can't eat two candies of the same color in a day.\n\nFind the maximal number of days Tanya can eat candies? Each day she needs to eat exactly two candies.",

She can eat any pair of candies this day because all of them have different colors.\n\nIn the second example, Tanya can eat candies for two days. For example, she can eat red and green candies on the first day, and green and blue candies on the second day.\n\nIn the third example, Tanya can eat candies for two days. For example, she can eat red and green candies on the first day, and red and blue candies on the second day. Note, that two red candies will remain uneaten.",
