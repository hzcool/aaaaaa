In other words, if you have chosen point $ p_i = (x, y) $ you can move it to $ (x, y + 1) $ , $ (x, y - 1) $ , $ (x + 1, y) $ or $ (x - 1, y) $ .\n\nYour goal to move points in such a way that they will form a square with sides parallel to $ \\mathit{OX} $ and $ \\mathit{OY} $ axes (a square with side $ 0 $ is allowed).\n\nWhat is the minimum number of steps you need to make such a square?",
