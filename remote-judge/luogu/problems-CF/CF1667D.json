    "description": "You are given a tree (connected, undirected, acyclic graph) with $ n $ vertices. Two edges are adjacent if they share exactly one endpoint. In one move you can remove an arbitrary edge, if that edge is adjacent to an even number of remaining edges.\n\nRemove all of the edges, or determine that it is impossible. If there are multiple solutions, print any.",
    "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThen $ n-1 $ lines follow. The $ i $ -th of them contains two integers $ u_i $ , $ v_i $ ( $ 1 \\le u_i,v_i \\le n $ ) the endpoints of the $ i $ -th edge. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
