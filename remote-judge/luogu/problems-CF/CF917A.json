He can't directly tell his mom where he is, because the monster that took him to the Upside Down will know and relocate him.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF917A/4c119b489e29bab2fd3dc778221019b04c8209ba.png)Thus, he came up with a puzzle to tell his mom his coordinates. His coordinates are the answer to the following problem.\n\nA string consisting only of parentheses ('(' and ')') is called a bracket sequence. Some bracket sequence are called correct bracket sequences. More formally:\n\n- Empty string is a correct bracket sequence.\n- if $ s $ is a correct bracket sequence, then $ (s) $ is also a correct bracket sequence.\n- if $ s $ and $ t $ are correct bracket sequences, then $ st $ (concatenation of $ s $ and $ t $ ) is also a correct bracket sequence.\n\nA string consisting of parentheses and question marks ('?') is called pretty if and only if there's a way to replace each question mark with either '(' or ')' such that the resulting string is a non-empty correct bracket sequence.\n\nWill gave his mom a string $ s $ consisting of parentheses and question marks (using Morse code through the lights) and his coordinates are the number of pairs of integers $ (l,r) $ such that $ 1<=l<=r<=|s| $ and the string $ s_{l}s_{l+1}...\\ s_{r} $ is pretty, where $ s_{i} $ is $ i $ -th character of $ s $ .\n\nJoyce doesn't know anything about bracket sequences, so she asked for your help.",
