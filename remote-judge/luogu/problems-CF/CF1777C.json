    "description": "A school has to decide on its team for an international quiz. There are $ n $ students in the school. We can describe the students using an array $ a $ where $ a_i $ is the smartness of the $ i $ -th ( $ 1 \\le i \\le n $ ) student.\n\nThere are $ m $ topics $ 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, m $ from which the quiz questions will be formed. The $ i $ -th student is considered proficient in a topic $ T $ if $ (a_i \\bmod T) = 0 $ . Otherwise, he is a rookie in that topic.\n\nWe say that a team of students is collectively proficient in all the topics if for every topic there is a member of the team proficient in this topic.\n\nFind a team that is collectively proficient in all the topics such that the maximum difference between the smartness of any two students in that team is minimized. Output this difference.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \\le n,m \\le 10^5 $ ).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5 $ ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ m $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",

    "hint": "In the first test case, we have participants with smartnesses $ 3 $ and $ 7 $ , and $ m = 4 $ . Thus, there is no student with smartness divisible by $ 2 $ . Since $ 2 \\leq m $ , there is no way to choose a team.\n\nIn the second test case, we can select the participant with smartness $ 2 $ to be the only one on the team. This way the team will be collectively proficient in both topics $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ .\n\nIn the third test case, consider the team with participants of smartnesses $ 4, 5, 6, 7 $ . This way the team will be collectively proficient in all topics $ 1, 2, \\ldots, 7 $ .",
