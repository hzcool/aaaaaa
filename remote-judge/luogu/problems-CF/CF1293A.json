Between each two adjacent floors in the building, there is a staircase connecting them.\n\nIt's lunchtime for our sensei Colin \"ConneR\" Neumann Jr, and he's planning for a location to enjoy his meal.\n\nConneR's office is at floor $ s $ of the building. On each floor (including floor $ s $ , of course), there is a restaurant offering meals. However, due to renovations being in progress, $ k $ of the restaurants are currently closed, and as a result, ConneR can't enjoy his lunch there.\n\nCooneR wants to reach a restaurant as quickly as possible to save time. What is the minimum number of staircases he needs to walk to reach a closest currently open restaurant.\n\nPlease answer him quickly, and you might earn his praise and even enjoy the lunch with him in the elegant Neumanns' way!",
