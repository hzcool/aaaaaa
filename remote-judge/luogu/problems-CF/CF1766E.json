    "description": "For a sequence of integers $ [x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_k] $ , let's define its decomposition as follows:\n\nProcess the sequence from the first element to the last one, maintaining the list of its subsequences. When you process the element $ x_i $ , append it to the end of the first subsequence in the list such that the bitwise AND of its last element and $ x_i $ is greater than $ 0 $ . If there is no such subsequence in the list, create a new subsequence with only one element $ x_i $ and append it to the end of the list of subsequences.\n\nFor example, let's analyze the decomposition of the sequence $ [1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1] $ :\n\n- processing element $ 1 $ , the list of subsequences is empty. There is no subsequence to append $ 1 $ to, so we create a new subsequence $ [1] $ ;\n- processing element $ 3 $ , the list of subsequences is $ [[1]] $ . Since the bitwise AND of $ 3 $ and $ 1 $ is $ 1 $ , the element is appended to the first subsequence;\n- processing element $ 2 $ , the list of subsequences is $ [[1, 3]] $ . Since the bitwise AND of $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ is $ 2 $ , the element is appended to the first subsequence;\n- processing element $ 0 $ , the list of subsequences is $ [[1, 3, 2]] $ . There is no subsequence to append $ 0 $ to, so we create a new subsequence $ [0] $ ;\n- processing element $ 1 $ , the list of subsequences is $ [[1, 3, 2], [0]] $ . There is no subsequence to append $ 1 $ to, so we create a new subsequence $ [1] $ ;\n- processing element $ 3 $ , the list of subsequences is $ [[1, 3, 2], [0], [1]] $ . Since the bitwise AND of $ 3 $ and $ 2 $ is $ 2 $ , the element is appended to the first subsequence;\n- processing element $ 2 $ , the list of subsequences is $ [[1, 3, 2, 3], [0], [1]] $ . Since the bitwise AND of $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ is $ 2 $ , the element is appended to the first subsequence;\n- processing element $ 1 $ , the list of subsequences is $ [[1, 3, 2, 3, 2], [0], [1]] $ . The element $ 1 $ cannot be appended to any of the first two subsequences, but can be appended to the third one.\n\nThe resulting list of subsequences is $ [[1, 3, 2, 3, 2], [0], [1, 1]] $ .\n\nLet $ f([x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_k]) $ be the number of subsequences the sequence $ [x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_k] $ is decomposed into.\n\nNow, for the problem itself.\n\nYou are given a sequence $ [a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n] $ , where each element is an integer from $ 0 $ to $ 3 $ . Let $ a[i..j] $ be the sequence $ [a_i, a_{i+1}, \\dots, a_j] $ . You have to calculate $ \\sum \\limits_{i=1}^n \\sum \\limits_{j=i}^n f(a[i..j]) $ .",
