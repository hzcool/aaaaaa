    "description": "Consider some square matrix $ A $ with side $ n $ consisting of zeros and ones. There are $ n $ rows numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from top to bottom and $ n $ columns numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from left to right in this matrix. We'll denote the element of the matrix which is located at the intersection of the $ i $ -row and the $ j $ -th column as $ A_{i,j} $ .\n\nLet's call matrix $ A $ clear if no two cells containing ones have a common side.\n\nLet's call matrix $ A $ symmetrical if it matches the matrices formed from it by a horizontal and/or a vertical reflection. Formally, for each pair $ (i,j) $ $ (1<=i,j<=n) $ both of the following conditions must be met: $ A_{i,j}=A_{n-i+1,j} $ and $ A_{i,j}=A_{i,n-j+1} $ .\n\nLet's define the sharpness of matrix $ A $ as the number of ones in it.\n\nGiven integer $ x $ , your task is to find the smallest positive integer $ n $ such that there exists a clear symmetrical matrix $ A $ with side $ n $ and sharpness $ x $ .",
