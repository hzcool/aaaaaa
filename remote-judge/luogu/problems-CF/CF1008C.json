    "description": "You are given an array of integers. Vasya can permute (change order) its integers. He wants to do it so that as many as possible integers will become on a place where a smaller integer used to stand. Help Vasya find the maximal number of such integers.\n\nFor instance, if we are given an array $ [10, 20, 30, 40] $ , we can permute it so that it becomes $ [20, 40, 10, 30] $ . Then on the first and the second positions the integers became larger ( $ 20>10 $ , $ 40>20 $ ) and did not on the third and the fourth, so for this permutation, the number that Vasya wants to maximize equals $ 2 $ . Read the note for the first example, there is one more demonstrative test case.\n\nHelp Vasya to permute integers in such way that the number of positions in a new array, where integers are greater than in the original one, is maximal.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the length of the array.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the elements of the array.",
    "outputFormat": "Print a single integer \u2014 the maximal number of the array's elements which after a permutation will stand on the position where a smaller element stood in the initial array.",

    "hint": "In the first sample, one of the best permutations is $ [1, 5, 5, 3, 10, 1, 1] $ . On the positions from second to fifth the elements became larger, so the answer for this permutation is 4.\n\nIn the second sample, there is no way to increase any element with a permutation, so the answer is 0.",
