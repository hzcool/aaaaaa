    "description": "Programmer Rostislav got seriously interested in the Link/Cut Tree data structure, which is based on Splay trees. Specifically, he is now studying the $ expose $ procedure.\n\nUnfortunately, Rostislav is unable to understand the definition of this procedure, so he decided to ask programmer Serezha to help him. Serezha agreed to help if Rostislav solves a simple task (and if he doesn't, then why would he need Splay trees anyway?)\n\nGiven integers $ l $ , $ r $ and $ k $ , you need to print all powers of number $ k $ within range from $ l $ to $ r $ inclusive. However, Rostislav doesn't want to spent time doing this, as he got interested in playing a network game called Agar with Gleb. Help him!",
