    "description": "You were dreaming that you are traveling to a planet named Planetforces on your personal spaceship. Unfortunately, its piloting system was corrupted and now you need to fix it in order to reach Planetforces.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1481A/fa6b9bf5f9953a74e4f4d8c616e89dc1461984e5.png)Space can be represented as the $ XY $ plane. You are starting at point $ (0, 0) $ , and Planetforces is located in point $ (p_x, p_y) $ .\n\nThe piloting system of your spaceship follows its list of orders which can be represented as a string $ s $ . The system reads $ s $ from left to right. Suppose you are at point $ (x, y) $ and current order is $ s_i $ :\n\n- if $ s_i = \\text{U} $ , you move to $ (x, y + 1) $ ;\n- if $ s_i = \\text{D} $ , you move to $ (x, y - 1) $ ;\n- if $ s_i = \\text{R} $ , you move to $ (x + 1, y) $ ;\n- if $ s_i = \\text{L} $ , you move to $ (x - 1, y) $ .\n\nSince string $ s $ could be corrupted, there is a possibility that you won't reach Planetforces in the end. Fortunately, you can delete some orders from $ s $ but you can't change their positions.\n\nCan you delete several orders (possibly, zero) from $ s $ in such a way, that you'll reach Planetforces after the system processes all orders?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines. The first line in each test case contains two integers $ p_x $ and $ p_y $ ( $ -10^5 \\le p_x, p_y \\le 10^5 $ ; $ (p_x, p_y) \\neq (0, 0) $ ) \u2014 the coordinates of Planetforces $ (p_x, p_y) $ .\n\nThe second line contains the string $ s $ ( $ 1 \\le |s| \\le 10^5 $ : $ |s| $ is the length of string $ s $ ) \u2014 the list of orders.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ |s| $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \"YES\" if you can delete several orders (possibly, zero) from $ s $ in such a way, that you'll reach Planetforces. Otherwise, print \"NO\". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).",
