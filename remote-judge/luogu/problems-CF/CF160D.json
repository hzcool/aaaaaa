    "description": "You are given a connected weighted undirected graph without any loops and multiple edges.\n\nLet us remind you that a graph's spanning tree is defined as an acyclic connected subgraph of the given graph that includes all of the graph's vertexes. The weight of a tree is defined as the sum of weights of the edges that the given tree contains. The minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph is defined as the graph's spanning tree having the minimum possible weight. For any connected graph obviously exists the minimum spanning tree, but in the general case, a graph's minimum spanning tree is not unique.\n\nYour task is to determine the following for each edge of the given graph: whether it is either included in any MST, or included at least in one MST, or not included in any MST.",

Then follow $ m $ lines, each of them contains three integers \u2014 the description of the graph's edges as \" $ a_{i} $ $ b_{i} $ $ w_{i} $ \" ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n,1<=w_{i}<=10^{6},a_{i}\u2260b_{i} $ ), where $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ are the numbers of vertexes connected by the $ i $ -th edge, $ w_{i} $ is the edge's weight. It is guaranteed that the graph is connected and doesn't contain loops or multiple edges.",
    "outputFormat": "Print $ m $ lines \u2014 the answers for all edges. If the $ i $ -th edge is included in any MST, print \"any\"; if the $ i $ -th edge is included at least in one MST, print \"at least one\"; if the $ i $ -th edge isn't included in any MST, print \"none\".
