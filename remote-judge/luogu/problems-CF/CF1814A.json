    "description": "In Berland, there are two types of coins, having denominations of $ 2 $ and $ k $ burles.\n\nYour task is to determine whether it is possible to represent $ n $ burles in coins, i. e. whether there exist non-negative integers $ x $ and $ y $ such that $ 2 \\cdot x + k \\cdot y = n $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le k \\le n \\le 10^{18} $ ; $ k \\ne 2 $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, print YES if it is possible to represent $ n $ burles in coins; otherwise, print NO. You may print each letter in any case (YES, yes, Yes will all be recognized as positive answer, NO, no and nO will all be recognized as negative answer).",

    "hint": "In the first test case, you can take one coin with denomination $ 2 $ and one coin with denomination $ k = 3 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, you can take three coins with denomination $ 2 $ . Alternatively, you can take six coins with denomination $ k = 1 $ .\n\nIn the third test case, there is no way to represent $ 7 $ burles.\n\nIn the fourth test case, you can take one coin with denomination $ k = 8 $ .",
