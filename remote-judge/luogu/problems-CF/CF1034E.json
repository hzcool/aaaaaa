    "description": "Little C loves number \u00ab3\u00bb very much. He loves all things about it.\n\nNow he is interested in the following problem:\n\nThere are two arrays of $ 2^n $ intergers $ a_0,a_1,...,a_{2^n-1} $ and $ b_0,b_1,...,b_{2^n-1} $ .\n\nThe task is for each $ i (0 \\leq i \\leq 2^n-1) $ , to calculate $ c_i=\\sum a_j \\cdot b_k $ ( $ j|k=i $ and $ j\\&k=0 $ , where \" $ | $ \" denotes [bitwise or operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR) and \" $ \\& $ \" denotes [bitwise and operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND)).\n\nIt's amazing that it can be proved that there are exactly $ 3^n $ triples $ (i,j,k) $ , such that $ j|k=i $ , $ j\\&k=0 $ and $ 0 \\leq i,j,k \\leq 2^n-1 $ . So Little C wants to solve this excellent problem (because it's well related to $ 3 $ ) excellently.\n\nHelp him calculate all $ c_i $ . Little C loves $ 3 $ very much, so he only want to know each $ c_i \\& 3 $ .",
