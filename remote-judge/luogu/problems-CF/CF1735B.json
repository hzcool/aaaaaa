    "description": "There are $ n $ pieces of tangerine peel, the $ i $ -th of them has size $ a_i $ . In one step it is possible to divide one piece of size $ x $ into two pieces of positive integer sizes $ y $ and $ z $ so that $ y + z = x $ .\n\nYou want that for each pair of pieces, their sizes differ strictly less than twice. In other words, there should not be two pieces of size $ x $ and $ y $ , such that $ 2x \\le y $ . What is the minimum possible number of steps needed to satisfy the condition?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 100 $ ).\n\nThen one line follows, containing $ n $ integers $ a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\ldots \\le a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 10^7 $ ).",

    "hint": "In the first test case, we initially have a piece of size $ 1 $ , so all final pieces must have size $ 1 $ . The total number of steps is: $ 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, we have just one piece, so we don't need to do anything, and the answer is $ 0 $ steps.\n\nIn the third test case, one of the possible cut options is: $ 600,\\ 900,\\ (600 | 700),\\ (1000 | 1000),\\ (1000 | 1000 | 550) $ . You can see this option in the picture below. The maximum piece has size $ 1000 $ , and it is less than $ 2 $ times bigger than the minimum piece of size $ 550 $ . $ 4 $ steps are done. We can show that it is the minimum possible number of steps.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1735B/28837ca57e9f20f873e71a5d21feab7da5248146.png)",
