    "description": "Ivan is developing his own computer game. Now he tries to create some levels for his game. But firstly for each level he needs to draw a graph representing the structure of the level.\n\nIvan decided that there should be exactly $ n_{i} $ vertices in the graph representing level $ i $ , and the edges have to be bidirectional. When constructing the graph, Ivan is interested in special edges called bridges. An edge between two vertices $ u $ and $ v $ is called a bridge if this edge belongs to every path between $ u $ and $ v $ (and these vertices will belong to different connected components if we delete this edge). For each level Ivan wants to construct a graph where at least half of the edges are bridges. He also wants to maximize the number of edges in each constructed graph.\n\nSo the task Ivan gave you is: given $ q $ numbers $ n_{1},n_{2},...,n_{q} $ , for each $ i $ tell the maximum number of edges in a graph with $ n_{i} $ vertices, if at least half of the edges are bridges. Note that the graphs cannot contain multiple edges or self-loops.",
