Each team is characterized by strength $ a_i $ . Each two teams $ i < j $ play with each other exactly once. Team $ i $ wins with probability $ \\frac{a_i}{a_i + a_j} $ and team $ j $ wins with probability $ \\frac{a_j}{a_i + a_j} $ .\n\nThe team is called a winner if it directly or indirectly defeated all other teams. Team $ a $ defeated (directly or indirectly) team $ b $ if there is a sequence of teams $ c_1 $ , $ c_2 $ , ... $ c_k $ such that $ c_1 = a $ , $ c_k = b $ and team $ c_i $ defeated team $ c_{i + 1} $ for all $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ k - 1 $ . Note that it is possible that team $ a $ defeated team $ b $ and in the same time team $ b $ defeated team $ a $ .\n\nWilliam wants you to find the expected value of the number of winners.",
