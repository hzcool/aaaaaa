Nicks is now sad and wants to go away as quickly as possible, but she lives in a 2D hexagonal world.\n\nConsider a hexagonal tiling of the plane as on the picture below.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1421D/d7b83f7c1945491e0c5eb4d61bc10fb5c2e2d62e.png)Nicks wishes to go from the cell marked $ (0, 0) $ to a certain cell given by the coordinates. She may go from a hexagon to any of its six neighbors you want, but there is a cost associated with each of them. The costs depend only on the direction in which you travel. Going from $ (0, 0) $ to $ (1, 1) $ will take the exact same cost as going from $ (-2, -1) $ to $ (-1, 0) $ . The costs are given in the input in the order $ c_1 $ , $ c_2 $ , $ c_3 $ , $ c_4 $ , $ c_5 $ , $ c_6 $ as in the picture below.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1421D/5520c3b497776aedfe7eabfa13d5468fdc04c261.png)Print the smallest cost of a path from the origin which has coordinates $ (0, 0) $ to the given cell.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^{4} $ ). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ -10^{9} \\le x, y \\le 10^{9} $ ) representing the coordinates of the target hexagon.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains six integers $ c_1 $ , $ c_2 $ , $ c_3 $ , $ c_4 $ , $ c_5 $ , $ c_6 $ ( $ 1 \\le c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5, c_6 \\le 10^{9} $ ) representing the six costs of the making one step in a particular direction (refer to the picture above to see which edge is for each value).",
