    "description": "Toad Zitz has an array of integers, each integer is between $ 0 $ and $ m-1 $ inclusive. The integers are $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ .\n\nIn one operation Zitz can choose an integer $ k $ and $ k $ indices $ i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_k $ such that $ 1 \\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_k \\leq n $ . He should then change $ a_{i_j} $ to $ ((a_{i_j}+1) \\bmod m) $ for each chosen integer $ i_j $ . The integer $ m $ is fixed for all operations and indices.\n\nHere $ x \\bmod y $ denotes the remainder of the division of $ x $ by $ y $ .\n\nZitz wants to make his array non-decreasing with the minimum number of such operations. Find this minimum number of operations.",

    "outputFormat": "Output one integer: the minimum number of described operations Zitz needs to make his array non-decreasing. If no operations required, print $ 0 $ .\n\nIt is easy to see that with enough operations Zitz can always make his array non-decreasing.",
