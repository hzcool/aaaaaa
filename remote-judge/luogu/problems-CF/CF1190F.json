    "description": "Tokitsukaze is playing a room escape game designed by SkywalkerT. In this game, she needs to find out hidden clues in the room to reveal a way to escape.\n\nAfter a while, she realizes that the only way to run away is to open the digital door lock since she accidentally went into a secret compartment and found some clues, which can be interpreted as:\n\n- Only when you enter $ n $ possible different passwords can you open the door;\n- Passwords must be integers ranged from $ 0 $ to $ (m - 1) $ ;\n- A password cannot be $ x $ ( $ 0 \\leq x < m $ ) if $ x $ and $ m $ are not coprime (i.e. $ x $ and $ m $ have some common divisor greater than $ 1 $ );\n- A password cannot be $ x $ ( $ 0 \\leq x < m $ ) if there exist non-negative integers $ e $ and $ k $ such that $ p^e = k m + x $ , where $ p $ is a secret integer;\n- Any integer that doesn't break the above rules can be a password;\n- Several integers are hidden in the room, but only one of them can be $ p $ .\n\nFortunately, she finds that $ n $ and $ m $ are recorded in the lock. However, what makes Tokitsukaze frustrated is that she doesn't do well in math. Now that she has found an integer that is suspected to be $ p $ , she wants you to help her find out $ n $ possible passwords, or determine the integer cannot be $ p $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The only line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ p $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\times 10^5 $ , $ 1 \\leq p < m \\leq 10^{18} $ ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that $ m $ is a positive integer power of a single prime number.",
    "outputFormat": "If the number of possible different passwords is less than $ n $ , print a single integer $ -1 $ .\n\nOtherwise, print $ n $ distinct integers ranged from $ 0 $ to $ (m - 1) $ as passwords. You can print these integers in any order. Besides, if there are multiple solutions, print any.",
