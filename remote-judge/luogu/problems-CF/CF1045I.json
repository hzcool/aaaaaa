    "description": "After learning a lot about space exploration, a little girl named Ana wants to change the subject.\n\nAna is a girl who loves palindromes (string that can be read the same backwards as forward). She has learned how to check for a given string whether it's a palindrome or not, but soon she grew tired of this problem, so she came up with a more interesting one and she needs your help to solve it:\n\nYou are given an array of strings which consist of only small letters of the alphabet. Your task is to find how many palindrome pairs are there in the array. A palindrome pair is a pair of strings such that the following condition holds: at least one permutation of the concatenation of the two strings is a palindrome. In other words, if you have two strings, let's say \"aab\" and \"abcac\", and you concatenate them into \"aababcac\", we have to check if there exists a permutation of this new string such that it is a palindrome (in this case there exists the permutation \"aabccbaa\").\n\nTwo pairs are considered different if the strings are located on different indices. The pair of strings with indices $ (i,j) $ is considered the same as the pair $ (j,i) $ .",
