    "description": "Gargari got bored to play with the bishops and now, after solving the problem about them, he is trying to do math homework. In a math book he have found $ k $ permutations. Each of them consists of numbers $ 1,2,...,n $ in some order. Now he should find the length of the longest common subsequence of these permutations. Can you help Gargari?\n\nYou can read about longest common subsequence there: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest\\_common\\_subsequence\\_problem",
