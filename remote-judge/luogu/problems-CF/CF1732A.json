    "description": "You are given an array $ a $ consisting of $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ . Friends asked you to make the [greatest common divisor (GCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of all numbers in the array equal to $ 1 $ . In one operation, you can do the following:\n\n- Select an arbitrary index in the array $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n $ ;\n- Make $ a_i = \\gcd(a_i, i) $ , where $ \\gcd(x, y) $ denotes the GCD of integers $ x $ and $ y $ . The cost of such an operation is $ n - i + 1 $ .\n\nYou need to find the minimum total cost of operations we need to perform so that the GCD of the all array numbers becomes equal to $ 1 $ .",
    "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 5\\,000 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 20 $ ) \u2014 the length of the array.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the elements of the array.",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum total cost of operations that will need to be performed so that the GCD of all numbers in the array becomes equal to $ 1 $ .\n\nWe can show that it's always possible to do so.",
