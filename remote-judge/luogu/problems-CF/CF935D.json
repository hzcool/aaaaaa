    "description": "Ancient Egyptians are known to have used a large set of symbols ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF935D/9d7de2306d9a860acda322166418d2eb2e3f0f44.png) to write on the walls of the temples. Fafa and Fifa went to one of the temples and found two non-empty words $ S_{1} $ and $ S_{2} $ of equal lengths on the wall of temple written one below the other. Since this temple is very ancient, some symbols from the words were erased. The symbols in the set ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF935D/9d7de2306d9a860acda322166418d2eb2e3f0f44.png) have equal probability for being in the position of any erased symbol.\n\nFifa challenged Fafa to calculate the probability that $ S_{1} $ is lexicographically greater than $ S_{2} $ . Can you help Fafa with this task?\n\nYou know that ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF935D/ef268df96da9b2e5c8e0a535fddc8c6d2cd6ef3b.png), i. e. there were $ m $ distinct characters in Egyptians' alphabet, in this problem these characters are denoted by integers from $ 1 $ to $ m $ in alphabet order. A word $ x $ is lexicographically greater than a word $ y $ of the same length, if the words are same up to some position, and then the word $ x $ has a larger character, than the word $ y $ .\n\nWe can prove that the probability equals to some fraction ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF935D/f3d3518082efa9b78c1dfc7f1e277e49a9674698.png), where $ P $ and $ Q $ are coprime integers, and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF935D/9d39e8956ca5ae36ed529a9998b81f8c971b6e39.png).
