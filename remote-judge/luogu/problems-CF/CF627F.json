    "description": "A remote island chain contains $ n $ islands, with some bidirectional bridges between them. The current bridge network forms a tree. In other words, a total of $ n-1 $ bridges connect pairs of islands in a way that it's possible to reach any island from any other island using the bridge network. The center of each island contains an identical pedestal, and all but one of the islands has a fragile, uniquely colored statue currently held on the pedestal. The remaining island holds only an empty pedestal.\n\nThe islanders want to rearrange the statues in a new order. To do this, they repeat the following process: first, they choose an island directly adjacent to the island containing an empty pedestal. Then, they painstakingly carry the statue on this island across the adjoining bridge and place it on the empty pedestal.\n\nIt is often impossible to rearrange statues in the desired order using only the operation described above. The islanders would like to build one additional bridge in order to make this achievable in the fewest number of movements possible. Find the bridge to construct and the minimum number of statue movements necessary to arrange the statues in the desired position.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=200000 $ ) \u2014 the total number of islands.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=n-1 $ ) \u2014 the statue currently located on the $ i $ -th island. If $ a_{i}=0 $ , then the island has no statue. It is guaranteed that the $ a_{i} $ are distinct.\n\nThe third line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ b_{i} $ ( $ 0<=b_{i}<=n-1 $ ) \u2014 the desired statues of the $ i $ -th island. Once again, $ b_{i}=0 $ indicates the island desires no statue. It is guaranteed that the $ b_{i} $ are distinct.\n\nThe next $ n-1 $ lines each contain two distinct space-separated integers $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ ( $ 1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n $ ) \u2014 the endpoints of the $ i $ -th bridge. Bridges form a tree, and it is guaranteed that no bridge is listed twice in the input.",
