    "description": "Alexey is travelling on a train. Unfortunately, due to the bad weather, the train moves slower that it should!\n\nAlexey took the train at the railroad terminal. Let's say that the train starts from the terminal at the moment $ 0 $ . Also, let's say that the train will visit $ n $ stations numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ along its way, and that Alexey destination is the station $ n $ .\n\nAlexey learned from the train schedule $ n $ integer pairs $ (a_i, b_i) $ where $ a_i $ is the expected time of train's arrival at the $ i $ -th station and $ b_i $ is the expected time of departure.\n\nAlso, using all information he has, Alexey was able to calculate $ n $ integers $ tm_1, tm_2, \\dots, tm_n $ where $ tm_i $ is the extra time the train need to travel from the station $ i - 1 $ to the station $ i $ . Formally, the train needs exactly $ a_i - b_{i-1} + tm_i $ time to travel from station $ i - 1 $ to station $ i $ (if $ i = 1 $ then $ b_0 $ is the moment the train leave the terminal, and it's equal to $ 0 $ ).\n\nThe train leaves the station $ i $ , if both conditions are met:\n\n1. it's on the station for at least $ \\left\\lceil \\frac{b_i - a_i}{2} \\right\\rceil $ units of time (division with ceiling);\n2. current time $ \\ge b_i $ .\n\nSince Alexey spent all his energy on prediction of time delays, help him to calculate the time of arrival at the station $ n $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of stations.\n\nNext $ n $ lines contain two integers each: $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i < b_i \\le 10^6 $ ). It's guaranteed that $ b_i < a_{i+1} $ .\n\nNext line contains $ n $ integers $ tm_1, tm_2, \\dots, tm_n $ ( $ 0 \\le tm_i \\le 10^6 $ ).",

    "hint": "In the first test case, Alexey arrives at station $ 1 $ without any delay at the moment $ a_1 = 2 $ (since $ tm_1 = 0 $ ). After that, he departs at moment $ b_1 = 4 $ . Finally, he arrives at station $ 2 $ with $ tm_2 = 2 $ extra time, or at the moment $ 12 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, Alexey arrives at the first station with $ tm_1 = 1 $ extra time, or at moment $ 2 $ . The train, from one side, should stay at the station at least $ \\left\\lceil \\frac{b_1 - a_1}{2} \\right\\rceil = 2 $ units of time and from the other side should depart not earlier than at moment $ b_1 = 4 $ . As a result, the trains departs right at the moment $ 4 $ .\n\nUsing the same logic, we can figure out that the train arrives at the second station at the moment $ 9 $ and departs at the moment $ 10 $ ; at the third station: arrives at $ 14 $ and departs at $ 15 $ ; at the fourth: arrives at $ 22 $ and departs at $ 23 $ . And, finally, arrives at the fifth station at $ 32 $ .",
