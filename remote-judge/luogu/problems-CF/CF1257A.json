    "description": "You are the gym teacher in the school.\n\nThere are $ n $ students in the row. And there are two rivalling students among them. The first one is in position $ a $ , the second in position $ b $ . Positions are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from left to right.\n\nSince they are rivals, you want to maximize the distance between them. If students are in positions $ p $ and $ s $ respectively, then distance between them is $ |p - s| $ .\n\nYou can do the following operation at most $ x $ times: choose two adjacent (neighbouring) students and swap them.\n\nCalculate the maximum distance between two rivalling students after at most $ x $ swaps.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains four integers $ n $ , $ x $ , $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 100 $ , $ 0 \\le x \\le 100 $ , $ 1 \\le a, b \\le n $ , $ a \\neq b $ ) \u2014 the number of students in the row, the number of swaps which you can do, and positions of first and second rivaling students respectively.",
