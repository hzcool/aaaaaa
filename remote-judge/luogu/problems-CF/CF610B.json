    "description": "Vika has $ n $ jars with paints of distinct colors. All the jars are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ and the $ i $ -th jar contains $ a_{i} $ liters of paint of color $ i $ .\n\nVika also has an infinitely long rectangular piece of paper of width $ 1 $ , consisting of squares of size $ 1\u00d71 $ . Squares are numbered $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ and so on. Vika decided that she will start painting squares one by one from left to right, starting from the square number $ 1 $ and some arbitrary color. If the square was painted in color $ x $ , then the next square will be painted in color $ x+1 $ . In case of $ x=n $ , next square is painted in color $ 1 $ . If there is no more paint of the color Vika wants to use now, then she stops.\n\nSquare is always painted in only one color, and it takes exactly $ 1 $ liter of paint. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of squares that might be painted, if Vika chooses right color to paint the first square.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=200000 $ ) \u2014 the number of jars with colors Vika has.\n\nThe second line of the input contains a sequence of integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ), where $ a_{i} $ is equal to the number of liters of paint in the $ i $ -th jar, i.e. the number of liters of color $ i $ that Vika has.",
    "outputFormat": "The only line of the output should contain a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of squares that Vika can paint if she follows the rules described above.",
