    "description": "Kolya got an integer array $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ . The array can contain both positive and negative integers, but Kolya doesn't like $ 0 $ , so the array doesn't contain any zeros.\n\nKolya doesn't like that the sum of some subsegments of his array can be $ 0 $ . The subsegment is some consecutive segment of elements of the array.\n\nYou have to help Kolya and change his array in such a way that it doesn't contain any subsegments with the sum $ 0 $ . To reach this goal, you can insert any integers between any pair of adjacent elements of the array (integers can be really any: positive, negative, $ 0 $ , any by absolute value, even such a huge that they can't be represented in most standard programming languages).\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of integers you have to insert into Kolya's array in such a way that the resulting array doesn't contain any subsegments with the sum $ 0 $ .",

It's enough to insert one element so the array doesn't contain any subsegments with the sum equal to zero. For example, it is possible to insert the integer $ 1 $ between second and third elements of the array.\n\nThere are no subsegments having sum $ 0 $ in the second example so you don't need to do anything.",
