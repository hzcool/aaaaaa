    "description": "Mr. Chanek has an integer represented by a string $ s $ . Zero or more digits have been erased and are denoted by the character \\_. There are also zero or more digits marked by the character X, meaning they're the same digit.\n\nMr. Chanek wants to count the number of possible integer $ s $ , where $ s $ is divisible by $ 25 $ . Of course, $ s $ must not contain any leading zero. He can replace the character \\_ with any digit. He can also replace the character X with any digit, but it must be the same for every character X.\n\nAs a note, a leading zero is any 0 digit that comes before the first nonzero digit in a number string in positional notation. For example, 0025 has two leading zeroes. An exception is the integer zero, (0 has no leading zero, but 0000 has three leading zeroes).",
