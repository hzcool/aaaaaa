    "description": "Permutation $ p $ is an ordered set of integers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ , consisting of $ n $ distinct positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed $ n $ . We'll denote the $ i $ -th element of permutation $ p $ as $ p_{i} $ . We'll call number $ n $ the size or the length of permutation $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ .\n\nYou have a sequence of integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . In one move, you are allowed to decrease or increase any number by one. Count the minimum number of moves, needed to build a permutation from this sequence.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=3\u00b710^{5} $ ) \u2014 the size of the sought permutation. The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "Print a single number \u2014 the minimum number of moves.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.",
