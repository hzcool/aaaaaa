    "description": "DZY owns $ 2^{m} $ islands near his home, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ 2^{m} $ . He loves building bridges to connect the islands. Every bridge he builds takes one day's time to walk across.\n\nDZY has a strange rule of building the bridges. For every pair of islands $ u,v\u00a0(u\u2260v) $ , he has built $ 2^{k} $ different bridges connecting them, where ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF446E/9c4056ad663bdf8b3a6c13926b07236321be3dbc.png) ( $ a|b $ means $ b $ is divisible by $ a $ ). These bridges are bidirectional.\n\nAlso, DZY has built some bridges connecting his home with the islands. Specifically, there are $ a_{i} $ different bridges from his home to the $ i $ -th island. These are one-way bridges, so after he leaves his home he will never come back.\n\nDZY decides to go to the islands for sightseeing. At first he is at home. He chooses and walks across one of the bridges connecting with his home, and arrives at some island. After that, he will spend $ t $ day(s) on the islands. Each day, he can choose to stay and rest, or to walk to another island across the bridge. It is allowed to stay at an island for more than one day. It's also allowed to cross one bridge more than once.\n\nSuppose that right after the $ t $ -th day DZY stands at the $ i $ -th island. Let $ ans[i] $ be the number of ways for DZY to reach the $ i $ -th island after $ t $ -th day. Your task is to calculate $ ans[i] $ for each $ i $ modulo $ 1051131 $ .",
