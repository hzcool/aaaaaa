    "description": "Two-gram is an ordered pair (i.e. string of length two) of capital Latin letters. For example, \"AZ\", \"AA\", \"ZA\" \u2014 three distinct two-grams.\n\nYou are given a string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ capital Latin letters. Your task is to find any two-gram contained in the given string as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times. For example, for string $ s $ = \"BBAABBBA\" the answer is two-gram \"BB\", which contained in $ s $ three times. In other words, find any most frequent two-gram.\n\nNote that occurrences of the two-gram can overlap with each other.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains integer number $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the length of string $ s $ . The second line of the input contains the string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ capital Latin letters.",
    "outputFormat": "Print the only line containing exactly two capital Latin letters \u2014 any two-gram contained in the given string $ s $ as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times.",

    "hint": "In the first example \"BA\" is also valid answer.\n\nIn the second example the only two-gram \"ZZ\" can be printed because it contained in the string \"ZZZAA\" two times.",
