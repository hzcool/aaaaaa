    "description": "You are given an $ n\u00d7m $ grid, some of its nodes are black, the others are white. Moreover, it's not an ordinary grid \u2014 each unit square of the grid has painted diagonals.\n\nThe figure below is an example of such grid of size $ 3\u00d75 $ . Four nodes of this grid are black, the other $ 11 $ nodes are white.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF435D/2a129804a620070f064ad9f06e8026399abd5ad7.png)Your task is to count the number of such triangles on the given grid that:\n\n- the corners match the white nodes, and the area is positive;\n- all sides go along the grid lines (horizontal, vertical or diagonal);\n- no side contains black nodes.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ $ (2<=n,m<=400) $ . Each of the following $ n $ lines contain $ m $ characters (zeros and ones) \u2014 the description of the grid. If the $ j $ -th character in the $ i $ -th line equals zero, then the node on the $ i $ -th horizontal line and on the $ j $ -th vertical line is painted white. Otherwise, the node is painted black.\n\nThe horizontal lines are numbered starting from one from top to bottom, the vertical lines are numbered starting from one from left to right.",
