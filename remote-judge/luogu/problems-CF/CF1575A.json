    "description": "Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of $ n $ books. Each book is represented by the book title \u2014 a string $ s_i $ numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , each with length $ m $ . Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.\n\nSettling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.\n\nA string $ a $ occurs before a string $ b $ in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where $ a $ and $ b $ differ, the following holds:\n\n- if it is an odd position, the string $ a $ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $ b $ ;\n- if it is an even position, the string $ a $ has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $ b $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\cdot m \\leq 10^6 $ ).\n\nThe $ i $ -th of the next $ n $ lines contains a string $ s_i $ consisting of $ m $ uppercase Latin letters \u2014 the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.",
