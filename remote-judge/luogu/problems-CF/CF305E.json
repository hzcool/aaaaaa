    "description": "Two people play the following string game. Initially the players have got some string $ s $ . The players move in turns, the player who cannot make a move loses.\n\nBefore the game began, the string is written on a piece of paper, one letter per cell.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF305E/e3dc20c8c09e1180ec4786b230762f8e7c79cfda.png)An example of the initial situation at $ s $ = \"abacaba\"A player's move is the sequence of actions:\n\n1. The player chooses one of the available pieces of paper with some string written on it. Let's denote it is $ t $ . Note that initially, only one piece of paper is available.\n2. The player chooses in the string $ t=t_{1}t_{2}...\\ t_{|t|} $ character in position $ i $ $ (1<=i<=|t|) $ such that for some positive integer $ l $ $ (0&lt;i-l;\u00a0i+l<=|t|) $ the following equations hold: $ t_{i-1}=t_{i+1} $ , $ t_{i-2}=t_{i+2} $ , ..., $ t_{i-l}=t_{i+l} $ .\n3. Player cuts the cell with the chosen character. As a result of the operation, he gets three new pieces of paper, the first one will contain string $ t_{1}t_{2}...\\ t_{i-1} $ , the second one will contain a string consisting of a single character $ t_{i} $ , the third one contains string $ t_{i+1}t_{i+2}...\\ t_{|t|} $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF305E/4da2b2c4651d8ec70c1d3e569c51588926a9324c.png)An example of making action $ (i=4) $ with string $ s $ = \u00ababacaba\u00bbYour task is to determine the winner provided that both players play optimally well.
