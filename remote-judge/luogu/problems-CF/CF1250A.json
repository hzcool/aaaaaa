    "description": "Polycarp recently signed up to a new social network Berstagram. He immediately published $ n $ posts there. He assigned numbers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ to all posts and published them one by one. So, just after publishing Polycarp's news feed contained posts from $ 1 $ to $ n $ \u2014 the highest post had number $ 1 $ , the next one had number $ 2 $ , ..., the lowest post had number $ n $ .\n\nAfter that he wrote down all likes from his friends. Likes were coming consecutively from the $ 1 $ -st one till the $ m $ -th one. You are given a sequence $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_m $ ( $ 1 \\le a_j \\le n $ ), where $ a_j $ is the post that received the $ j $ -th like.\n\nNews feed in Berstagram works in the following manner. Let's assume the $ j $ -th like was given to post $ a_j $ . If this post is not the highest (first) one then it changes its position with the one above. If $ a_j $ is the highest post nothing changes.\n\nFor example, if $ n=3 $ , $ m=5 $ and $ a=[3,2,1,3,3] $ , then Polycarp's news feed had the following states:\n\n- before the first like: $ [1, 2, 3] $ ;\n- after the first like: $ [1, 3, 2] $ ;\n- after the second like: $ [1, 2, 3] $ ;\n- after the third like: $ [1, 2, 3] $ ;\n- after the fourth like: $ [1, 3, 2] $ ;\n- after the fifth like: $ [3, 1, 2] $ .\n\nPolycarp wants to know the highest (minimum) and the lowest (maximum) positions for each post. Polycarp considers all moments of time, including the moment \"before all likes\".",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integer numbers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 10^5 $ , $ 1 \\le m \\le 4 \\cdot10^5 $ ) \u2014 number of posts and number of likes.\n\nThe second line contains integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_m $ ( $ 1 \\le a_j \\le n $ ), where $ a_j $ is the post that received the $ j $ -th like.",
    "outputFormat": "Print $ n $ pairs of integer numbers. The $ i $ -th line should contain the highest (minimum) and the lowest (maximum) positions of the $ i $ -th post. You should take into account positions at all moments of time: before all likes, after each like and after all likes. Positions are numbered from $ 1 $ (highest) to $ n $ (lowest).",
