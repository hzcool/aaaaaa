    "description": "Polycarp found a rectangular table consisting of $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns. He noticed that each cell of the table has its number, obtained by the following algorithm \"by columns\":\n\n- cells are numbered starting from one;\n- cells are numbered from left to right by columns, and inside each column from top to bottom;\n- number of each cell is an integer one greater than in the previous cell.\n\nFor example, if $ n = 3 $ and $ m = 5 $ , the table will be numbered as follows:\n\n$$ \n\\begin{matrix} \n1 & 4 & 7 & 10 & 13 \\\\ 2 & 5 & 8 & 11 & 14 \\\\ 3 & 6 & 9 & 12 & 15 \\\\ \n\\end{matrix}  \n$$\nHowever, Polycarp considers such numbering inconvenient. He likes the numbering **\"by rows\"**: \n\n- cells are numbered starting from one;\n- cells are numbered from top to bottom by rows, and inside each row from left to right;\n- number of each cell is an integer one greater than the number of the previous cell.\n\nFor example, if  $ n = 3 $  and  $ m = 5 $ , then Polycarp likes the following table numbering:  \n\n$$  \\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\ 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 \\\\ \\end{matrix}  \n$$\n\nPolycarp doesn't have much time, so he asks you to find out what would be the cell number in the numbering **\"by rows\"**, if in the numbering **\"by columns\"** the cell has the number  $ x$?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ). Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case consists of a single line containing three integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ x $ ( $ 1 \\le n, m \\le 10^6 $ , $ 1 \\le x \\le n \\cdot m $ ), where $ n $ and $ m $ are the number of rows and columns in the table, and $ x $ is the cell number.\n\nNote that the numbers in some test cases do not fit into the $ 32 $ -bit integer type, so you must use at least the $ 64 $ -bit integer type of your programming language.",
