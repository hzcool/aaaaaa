She started to practice various sports, such as Archery, Yoga, and Football.Since she started engaging in sports activities, Ela switches to trying a new sport on days she considers being \"Luxury\" days. She counts the days since she started these activities, in which the day she starts is numbered as day $ 1 $ . A \"Luxury\" day is the day in which the number of this day is a luxurious number.\n\nAn integer $ x $ is called a luxurious number if it is divisible by $ {\\lfloor \\sqrt{x} \\rfloor} $ .\n\nHere $ \\lfloor r \\rfloor $ denotes the \"floor\" of a real number $ r $ . In other words, it's the largest integer not greater than $ r $ .\n\nFor example: $ 8 $ , $ 56 $ , $ 100 $ are luxurious numbers, since $ 8 $ is divisible by $ \\lfloor \\sqrt{8} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2.8284 \\rfloor = 2 $ , $ 56 $ is divisible $ \\lfloor \\sqrt{56} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 7.4833 \\rfloor = 7 $ , and $ 100 $ is divisible by $ \\lfloor \\sqrt{100} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 10 \\rfloor = 10 $ , respectively. On the other hand $ 5 $ , $ 40 $ are not, since $ 5 $ are not divisible by $ \\lfloor \\sqrt{5} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2.2361 \\rfloor = 2 $ , and $ 40 $ are not divisible by $ \\lfloor \\sqrt{40} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 6.3246 \\rfloor = 6 $ .\n\nBeing a friend of Ela, you want to engage in these fitness activities with her to keep her and yourself accompanied (and have fun together, of course). Between day $ l $ and day $ r $ , you want to know how many times she changes the activities.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line has the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10\\ 000 $ ). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le 10^{18} $ ) \u2014 the intervals at which you want to know how many times Ela changes her sports.",
