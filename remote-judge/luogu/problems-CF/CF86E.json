    "description": "A sequence $ a_{0},a_{1},... $ is called a recurrent binary sequence, if each term $ a_{i} $ $ (i=0,1,...) $ is equal to 0 or 1 and there exist coefficients ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF86E/4a34536159949a9ab9513f40b0fa6f71f8e25cc5.png) such that\n\n $ a_{n}=c_{1}\u00b7a_{n-1}+c_{2}\u00b7a_{n-2}+...+c_{k}\u00b7a_{n-k}\\ (mod\\ 2), $  for all $ n>=k $ . Assume that not all of $ c_{i} $ are zeros.Note that such a sequence can be uniquely recovered from any $ k $ -tuple $ {a_{s},a_{s+1},...,a_{s+k-1}} $ and so it is periodic. Moreover, if a $ k $ -tuple contains only zeros, then the sequence contains only zeros, so this case is not very interesting. Otherwise the minimal period of the sequence is not greater than $ 2^{k}-1 $ , as $ k $ -tuple determines next element, and there are $ 2^{k}-1 $ non-zero $ k $ -tuples. Let us call a sequence long if its minimal period is exactly $ 2^{k}-1 $ . Your task is to find a long sequence for a given $ k $ , if there is any.",

All of them (elements and coefficients) should be equal to 0 or 1, and at least one $ c_{i} $ has to be equal to 1.\n\nIf there are several solutions, output any.",
