    "description": "Sam started playing with round buckets in the sandbox, while also scattering pebbles. His mom decided to buy him a new bucket, so she needs to solve the following task.\n\nYou are given $ n $ distinct points with integer coordinates $ A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n $ . All points were generated from the square $ [-10^8, 10^8] \\times [-10^8, 10^8] $ uniformly and independently.\n\nYou are given positive integers $ k $ , $ l $ , such that $ k \\leq l \\leq n $ . You want to select a subsegment $ A_i, A_{i+1}, \\ldots, A_{i+l-1} $ of the points array (for some $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n + 1 - l $ ), and some circle on the plane, containing $ \\geq k $ points of the selected subsegment (inside or on the border).\n\nWhat is the smallest possible radius of that circle?",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Descriptions of test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $ n $ , $ l $ , $ k $ ( $ 2 \\leq k \\leq l \\leq n \\leq 50\\,000 $ , $ k \\leq 20 $ ).\n\nEach of the next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ x_i $ , $ y_i $ ( $ -10^8 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq 10^8 $ ) \u2014 the coordinates of the point $ A_i $ . It is guaranteed that all points are distinct and were generated independently from uniform distribution on $ [-10^8, 10^8] \\times [-10^8, 10^8] $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ for all test cases does not exceed $ 50\\,000 $ .\n\nIn the first test, points were not generated from the uniform distribution on $ [-10^8, 10^8] \\times [-10^8, 10^8] $ for simplicity. It is the only such test and your solution must pass it.\n\nHacks are disabled in this problem.",
