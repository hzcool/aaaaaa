    "description": "Makoto has a big blackboard with a positive integer $ n $ written on it. He will perform the following action exactly $ k $ times:\n\nSuppose the number currently written on the blackboard is $ v $ . He will randomly pick one of the divisors of $ v $ (possibly $ 1 $ and $ v $ ) and replace $ v $ with this divisor. As Makoto uses his famous random number generator (RNG) and as he always uses $ 58 $ as his generator seed, each divisor is guaranteed to be chosen with equal probability.\n\nHe now wonders what is the expected value of the number written on the blackboard after $ k $ steps.\n\nIt can be shown that this value can be represented as $ \\frac{P}{Q} $ where $ P $ and $ Q $ are coprime integers and $ Q \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{10^9+7} $ . Print the value of $ P \\cdot Q^{-1} $ modulo $ 10^9+7 $ .",
