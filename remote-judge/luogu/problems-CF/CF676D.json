    "description": "Theseus has just arrived to Crete to fight Minotaur. He found a labyrinth that has a form of a rectangular field of size $ n\u00d7m $ and consists of blocks of size $ 1\u00d71 $ .\n\nEach block of the labyrinth has a button that rotates all blocks $ 90 $ degrees clockwise. Each block rotates around its center and doesn't change its position in the labyrinth. Also, each block has some number of doors (possibly none). In one minute, Theseus can either push the button in order to rotate all the blocks $ 90 $ degrees clockwise or pass to the neighbouring block. Theseus can go from block $ A $ to some neighbouring block $ B $ only if block $ A $ has a door that leads to block $ B $ and block $ B $ has a door that leads to block $ A $ .\n\nTheseus found an entrance to labyrinth and is now located in block $ (x_{T},y_{T}) $ \u2014 the block in the row $ x_{T} $ and column $ y_{T} $ . Theseus know that the Minotaur is hiding in block $ (x_{M},y_{M}) $ and wants to know the minimum number of minutes required to get there.\n\nTheseus is a hero, not a programmer, so he asks you to help him.",
