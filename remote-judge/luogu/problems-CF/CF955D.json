    "description": "Jenya has recently acquired quite a useful tool \u2014 $ k $ -scissors for cutting strings. They are generally used for cutting out two non-intersecting substrings of length $ k $ from an arbitrary string $ s $ (its length should be at least $ 2\u00b7k $ in order to perform this operation) and concatenating them afterwards (preserving the initial order). For example, with the help of $ 2 $ -scissors you can cut $ ab $ and $ de $ out of $ abcde $ and concatenate them into $ abde $ , but not $ ab $ and $ bc $ since they're intersecting.\n\nIt's a nice idea to test this tool before using it in practice. After looking through the papers, Jenya came up with two strings $ s $ and $ t $ . His question is whether it is possible to apply his scissors to string $ s $ such that the resulting concatenation contains $ t $ as a substring?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ k $ $ (2<=m<=2\u00b7k<=n<=5\u00b710^{5}) $ \u2014 length of $ s $ , length of $ t $ and the aforementioned scissors' parameter correspondingly.\n\nThe next two lines feature $ s $ and $ t $ consisting of lowercase latin letters.",
    "outputFormat": "If there is no answer, print \u00abNo\u00bb.\n\nOtherwise print \u00abYes\u00bb and two integers $ L $ and $ R $ denoting the indexes where cutted substrings start ( $ 1 $ -indexed). If there are several possible answers, output any.",

    ],
    "hint": "In the first sample case you can cut out two substrings starting at $ 1 $ and $ 5 $ . The resulting string baaaab contains aaaa as a substring.\n\nIn the second sample case the resulting string is bccb.",
