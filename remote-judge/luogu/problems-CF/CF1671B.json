    "description": "You are given $ n $ points with integer coordinates on a coordinate axis $ OX $ . The coordinate of the $ i $ -th point is $ x_i $ . All points' coordinates are distinct and given in strictly increasing order.\n\nFor each point $ i $ , you can do the following operation no more than once: take this point and move it by $ 1 $ to the left or to the right (i..e., you can change its coordinate $ x_i $ to $ x_i - 1 $ or to $ x_i + 1 $ ). In other words, for each point, you choose (separately) its new coordinate. For the $ i $ -th point, it can be either $ x_i - 1 $ , $ x_i $ or $ x_i + 1 $ .\n\nYour task is to determine if you can move some points as described above in such a way that the new set of points forms a consecutive segment of integers, i. e. for some integer $ l $ the coordinates of points should be equal to $ l, l + 1, \\ldots, l + n - 1 $ .\n\nNote that the resulting points should have distinct coordinates.\n\nYou have to answer $ t $ independent test cases.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of points in the set $ x $ .\n\nThe second line of the test case contains $ n $ integers $ x_1 < x_2 < \\ldots < x_n $ ( $ 1 \\le x_i \\le 10^6 $ ), where $ x_i $ is the coordinate of the $ i $ -th point.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the points are given in strictly increasing order (this also means that all coordinates are distinct). It is also guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ( $ \\sum n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ).",
