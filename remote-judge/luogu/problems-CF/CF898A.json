    "description": "Vasya has a non-negative integer $ n $ . He wants to round it to nearest integer, which ends up with $ 0 $ . If $ n $ already ends up with $ 0 $ , Vasya considers it already rounded.\n\nFor example, if $ n=4722 $ answer is $ 4720 $ . If $ n=5 $ Vasya can round it to $ 0 $ or to $ 10 $ . Both ways are correct.\n\nFor given $ n $ find out to which integer will Vasya round it.",
