    "description": "There are two bus stops denoted A and B, and there $ n $ buses that go from A to B every day. The shortest path from A to B takes $ t $ units of time but some buses might take longer paths. Moreover, buses are allowed to overtake each other during the route.\n\nAt each station one can find a sorted list of moments of time when a bus is at this station. We denote this list as $ a_1 < a_2 < \\ldots < a_n $ for stop A and as $ b_1 < b_2 < \\ldots < b_n $ for stop B. The buses always depart from A and arrive to B according to the timetable, but the order in which the buses arrive may differ. Let's call an order of arrivals valid if each bus arrives at least $ t $ units of time later than departs.\n\nIt is known that for an order to be valid the latest possible arrival for the bus that departs at $ a_i $ is $ b_{x_i} $ , i.e. $ x_i $ -th in the timetable. In other words, for each $ i $ there exists such a valid order of arrivals that the bus departed $ i $ -th arrives $ x_i $ -th (and all other buses can arrive arbitrary), but there is no valid order of arrivals in which the $ i $ -th departed bus arrives $ (x_i + 1) $ -th.\n\nFormally, let's call a permutation $ p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n $ valid, if $ b_{p_i} \\ge a_i + t $ for all $ i $ . Then $ x_i $ is the maximum value of $ p_i $ among all valid permutations.\n\nYou are given the sequences $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ and $ x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n $ , but not the arrival timetable. Find out any suitable timetable for stop B $ b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n $ or determine that there is no such timetable.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 200\\,000 $ , $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 10^{18} $ ) \u2014 the number of buses in timetable for and the minimum possible travel time from stop A to stop B.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\leq a_1 < a_2 < \\ldots < a_n \\leq 10^{18} $ ), defining the moments of time when the buses leave stop A.\n\nThe third line contains $ n $ integers $ x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n $ ( $ 1 \\leq x_i \\leq n $ ), the $ i $ -th of them stands for the maximum possible timetable position, at which the $ i $ -th bus leaving stop A can arrive at stop B.",
    "outputFormat": "If a solution exists, print \"Yes\" (without quotes) in the first line of the output.\n\nIn the second line print $ n $ integers $ b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n $ ( $ 1 \\leq b_1 < b_2 < \\ldots < b_n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^{18} $ ). We can show that if there exists any solution, there exists a solution that satisfies such constraints on $ b_i $ . If there are multiple valid answers you can print any of them.\n\nIf there is no valid timetable, print \"No\" (without quotes) in the only line of the output.",

To get $ x_2 = 2 $ and $ x_3 = 3 $ the buses can arrive in the order $ (1, 2, 3) $ . $ x_1 $ is not $ 3 $ , because the permutations $ (3, 1, 2) $ and $ (3, 2, 1) $ (all in which the $ 1 $ -st bus arrives $ 3 $ -rd) are not valid (sube buses arrive too early), $ x_2 $ is not $ 3 $ because of similar reasons.",
