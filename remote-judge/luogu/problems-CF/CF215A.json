    "description": "Vasya's bicycle chain drive consists of two parts: $ n $ stars are attached to the pedal axle, $ m $ stars are attached to the rear wheel axle. The chain helps to rotate the rear wheel by transmitting the pedal rotation.\n\nWe know that the $ i $ -th star on the pedal axle has $ a_{i} $ $ (0&lt;a_{1}&lt;a_{2}&lt;...&lt;a_{n}) $ teeth, and the $ j $ -th star on the rear wheel axle has $ b_{j} $ $ (0&lt;b_{1}&lt;b_{2}&lt;...&lt;b_{m}) $ teeth. Any pair $ (i,j) $ $ (1<=i<=n $ ; $ 1<=j<=m) $ is called a gear and sets the indexes of stars to which the chain is currently attached. Gear $ (i,j) $ has a gear ratio, equal to the value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF215A/552855b6cae5503b6d59fc360af0683e021f4625.png).\n\nSince Vasya likes integers, he wants to find such gears $ (i,j) $ , that their ratios are integers. On the other hand, Vasya likes fast driving, so among all \"integer\" gears $ (i,j) $ he wants to choose a gear with the maximum ratio. Help him to find the number of such gears.\n\nIn the problem, fraction ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF215A/552855b6cae5503b6d59fc360af0683e021f4625.png) denotes division in real numbers, that is, no rounding is performed.",
    "inputFormat": "The first input line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=50) $ \u2014 the number of stars on the bicycle's pedal axle. The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=10^{4}) $ in the order of strict increasing.\n\nThe third input line contains integer $ m $ $ (1<=m<=50) $ \u2014 the number of stars on the rear wheel axle. The fourth line contains $ m $ integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{m} $ $ (1<=b_{i}<=10^{4}) $ in the order of strict increasing.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there exists at least one gear ( $ i,j $ ), that its gear ratio is an integer.
