    "description": "This is the hard version of this problem. The only difference is the limit of $ n $ - the length of the input string. In this version, $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^6 $ .\n\nLet's define a correct bracket sequence and its depth as follow:\n\n- An empty string is a correct bracket sequence with depth $ 0 $ .\n- If \"s\" is a correct bracket sequence with depth $ d $ then \"(s)\" is a correct bracket sequence with depth $ d + 1 $ .\n- If \"s\" and \"t\" are both correct bracket sequences then their concatenation \"st\" is a correct bracket sequence with depth equal to the maximum depth of $ s $ and $ t $ .\n\nFor a (not necessarily correct) bracket sequence $ s $ , we define its depth as the maximum depth of any correct bracket sequence induced by removing some characters from $ s $ (possibly zero). For example: the bracket sequence $ s =  $ \"())(())\" has depth $ 2 $ , because by removing the third character we obtain a correct bracket sequence \"()(())\" with depth $ 2 $ .\n\nGiven a string $ a $ consists of only characters '(', ')' and '?'. Consider all (not necessarily correct) bracket sequences obtained by replacing all characters '?' in $ a $ by either '(' or ')'. Calculate the sum of all the depths of all these bracket sequences. As this number can be large, find it modulo $ 998244353 $ .\n\nHacks in this problem can be done only if easy and hard versions of this problem was solved.",

    "hint": "In the first test case, we can obtain $ 4 $ bracket sequences by replacing all characters '?' with either '(' or ')':\n\n- \"((\". Its depth is $ 0 $ ;\n- \"))\". Its depth is $ 0 $ ;\n- \")(\". Its depth is $ 0 $ ;\n- \"()\". Its depth is $ 1 $ .\n\nSo, the answer is $ 1 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, we can obtain $ 4 $ bracket sequences by replacing all characters '?' with either '(' or ')':\n\n- \"(((())\". Its depth is $ 2 $ ;\n- \"()()))\". Its depth is $ 2 $ ;\n- \"((()))\". Its depth is $ 3 $ ;\n- \"()(())\". Its depth is $ 2 $ .\n\nSo, the answer is $ 9 = 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 $ .",
