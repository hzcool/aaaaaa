    "description": "You are given a matrix $ a $ of size $ n \\times m $ consisting of integers.\n\nYou can choose no more than $ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{m}{2}\\right\\rfloor $ elements in each row. Your task is to choose these elements in such a way that their sum is divisible by $ k $ and this sum is the maximum.\n\nIn other words, you can choose no more than a half (rounded down) of elements in each row, you have to find the maximum sum of these elements divisible by $ k $ .\n\nNote that you can choose zero elements (and the sum of such set is $ 0 $ ).",

The next $ n $ lines contain $ m $ elements each, where the $ j $ -th element of the $ i $ -th row is $ a_{i, j} $ ( $ 1 \\le a_{i, j} \\le 70 $ ).",
