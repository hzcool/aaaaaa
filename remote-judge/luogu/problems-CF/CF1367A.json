    "description": "Alice guesses the strings that Bob made for her.\n\nAt first, Bob came up with the secret string $ a $ consisting of lowercase English letters. The string $ a $ has a length of $ 2 $ or more characters. Then, from string $ a $ he builds a new string $ b $ and offers Alice the string $ b $ so that she can guess the string $ a $ .\n\nBob builds $ b $ from $ a $ as follows: he writes all the substrings of length $ 2 $ of the string $ a $ in the order from left to right, and then joins them in the same order into the string $ b $ .\n\nFor example, if Bob came up with the string $ a $ =\"abac\", then all the substrings of length $ 2 $ of the string $ a $ are: \"ab\", \"ba\", \"ac\". Therefore, the string $ b $ =\"abbaac\".\n\nYou are given the string $ b $ . Help Alice to guess the string $ a $ that Bob came up with. It is guaranteed that $ b $ was built according to the algorithm given above. It can be proved that the answer to the problem is unique.",
