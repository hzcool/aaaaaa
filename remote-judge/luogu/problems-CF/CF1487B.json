    "description": "Suppose you are living with two cats: A and B. There are $ n $ napping spots where both cats usually sleep.\n\nYour cats like to sleep and also like all these spots, so they change napping spot each hour cyclically:\n\n- Cat A changes its napping place in order: $ n, n - 1, n - 2, \\dots, 3, 2, 1, n, n - 1, \\dots $ In other words, at the first hour it's on the spot $ n $ and then goes in decreasing order cyclically;\n- Cat B changes its napping place in order: $ 1, 2, 3, \\dots, n - 1, n, 1, 2, \\dots $ In other words, at the first hour it's on the spot $ 1 $ and then goes in increasing order cyclically.\n\nThe cat B is much younger, so they have a strict hierarchy: A and B don't lie together. In other words, if both cats'd like to go in spot $ x $ then the A takes this place and B moves to the next place in its order (if $ x < n $ then to $ x + 1 $ , but if $ x = n $ then to $ 1 $ ). Cat B follows his order, so it won't return to the skipped spot $ x $ after A frees it, but will move to the spot $ x + 2 $ and so on.\n\nCalculate, where cat B will be at hour $ k $ ?",
