    "description": "As a professional private tutor, Kuroni has to gather statistics of an exam. Kuroni has appointed you to complete this important task. You must not disappoint him.\n\nThe exam consists of $ n $ questions, and $ m $ students have taken the exam. Each question was worth $ 1 $ point. Question $ i $ was solved by at least $ l_i $ and at most $ r_i $ students. Additionally, you know that the total score of all students is $ t $ .\n\nFurthermore, you took a glance at the final ranklist of the quiz. The students were ranked from $ 1 $ to $ m $ , where rank $ 1 $ has the highest score and rank $ m $ has the lowest score. Ties were broken arbitrarily.\n\nYou know that the student at rank $ p_i $ had a score of $ s_i $ for $ 1 \\le i \\le q $ .\n\nYou wonder if there could have been a huge tie for first place. Help Kuroni determine the maximum number of students who could have gotten as many points as the student with rank $ 1 $ , and the maximum possible score for rank $ 1 $ achieving this maximum number of students.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two integers ( $ 1 \\le n, m \\le 10^{5} $ ), denoting the number of questions of the exam and the number of students respectively.\n\nThe next $ n $ lines contain two integers each, with the $ i $ -th line containing $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ ( $ 0 \\le l_{i} \\le r_{i} \\le m $ ).\n\nThe next line contains a single integer $ q $ ( $ 0 \\le q \\le m $ ).\n\nThe next $ q $ lines contain two integers each, denoting $ p_{i} $ and $ s_{i} $ ( $ 1 \\le p_{i} \\le m $ , $ 0 \\le s_{i} \\le n $ ). It is guaranteed that all $ p_{i} $ are distinct and if $ p_{i} \\le p_{j} $ , then $ s_{i} \\ge s_{j} $ .\n\nThe last line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 0 \\le t \\le nm $ ), denoting the total score of all students.",
    "outputFormat": "Output two integers: the maximum number of students who could have gotten as many points as the student with rank $ 1 $ , and the maximum possible score for rank $ 1 $ achieving this maximum number of students. If there is no valid arrangement that fits the given data, output $ -1 $ $ -1 $ .",

    "hint": "For the first sample, here is one possible arrangement that fits the data:\n\nStudents $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ both solved problems $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ .\n\nStudent $ 3 $ solved problems $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ .\n\nStudent $ 4 $ solved problem $ 4 $ .\n\nThe total score of all students is $ T = 7 $ . Note that the scores of the students are $ 2 $ , $ 2 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 1 $ respectively, which satisfies the condition that the student at rank $ 4 $ gets exactly $ 1 $ point. Finally, $ 3 $ students tied for first with a maximum score of $ 2 $ , and it can be proven that we cannot do better with any other arrangement.",
