    "description": "Vasya has got an array consisting of $ n $ integers, and two integers $ k $ and $ len $ in addition. All numbers in the array are either between $ 1 $ and $ k $ (inclusive), or equal to $ -1 $ . The array is good if there is no segment of $ len $ consecutive equal numbers.\n\nVasya will replace each $ -1 $ with some number from $ 1 $ to $ k $ (inclusive) in such a way that the resulting array is good. Tell him the number of ways to do this replacement. Since the answer may be large, print it modulo $ 998244353 $ .",
