    "description": "Kostya and Zhenya \u2014 the creators of the band \"Paper\" \u2014 after the release of the legendary album decided to create a new band \"Day movers\", for this they need to find two new people.\n\nThey invited $ n $ people to the casting. The casting will last $ q $ days. On the $ i $ th of the days, Kostya and Zhenya want to find two people on the segment from $ l_i $ to $ r_i $ who are most suitable for their band. Since \"Day movers\" are doing a modern art, musical skills are not important to them and they look only at other signs: they want the height difference between two people to be as small as possible.\n\nHelp them, and for each day, find the minimum difference in the growth of people from the casting on this segment!",
    "inputFormat": "In the first line you are given two integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\leq q \\leq 10^6 $ ) \u2014 the number of people who came to the casting and the number of casting days.\n\nIn the second line, you are given $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\leq a_i \\leq n $ ) \u2014 the growth of each of the candidates.\n\nIt is also guaranteed that all $ a_i $ are different.\n\nThe following $ q $ lines each contains two integers $ l_i $ and $ r_i $ ( $ 1 \\leq l_i < r_i \\leq n $ ) \u2014 a segment of people on the $ i $ th day of casting.",

On the segment $ [1, 2] $ , the numbers with the minimum difference are $ 2 $ and $ 6 $ ( $ 6 - 2 = 4 $ ). On the segment $ [3, 6] $ , the numbers with the minimum difference are $ 1 $ and $ 3 $ ( $ 3 - 1 = 2 $ ).
