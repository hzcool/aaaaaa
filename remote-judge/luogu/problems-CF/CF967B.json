    "description": "Arkady wants to water his only flower. Unfortunately, he has a very poor watering system that was designed for $ n $ flowers and so it looks like a pipe with $ n $ holes. Arkady can only use the water that flows from the first hole.\n\nArkady can block some of the holes, and then pour $ A $ liters of water into the pipe. After that, the water will flow out from the non-blocked holes proportionally to their sizes $ s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n $ . In other words, if the sum of sizes of non-blocked holes is $ S $ , and the $ i $ -th hole is not blocked, $ \\frac{s_i \\cdot A}{S} $ liters of water will flow out of it.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of holes Arkady should block to make at least $ B $ liters of water flow out of the first hole?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ A $ , $ B $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000 $ , $ 1 \\le B \\le A \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of holes, the volume of water Arkady will pour into the system, and the volume he wants to get out of the first hole.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n $ ( $ 1 \\le s_i \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the sizes of the holes.",
