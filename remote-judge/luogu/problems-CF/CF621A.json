Please, calculate this value for Wet Shark.\n\nNote, that if Wet Shark uses no integers from the $ n $ integers, the sum is an even integer $ 0 $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer, $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ ). The next line contains $ n $ space separated integers given to Wet Shark. Each of these integers is in range from $ 1 $ to $ 10^{9} $ , inclusive.",
