    "description": "As Valeric and Valerko were watching one of the last Euro Championship games in a sports bar, they broke a mug. Of course, the guys paid for it but the barman said that he will let them watch football in his bar only if they help his son complete a programming task. The task goes like that.\n\nLet's consider a set of functions of the following form:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF195D/bc3a6f827f49bee100d9da6adde48766963384ee.png) Let's define a sum of $ n $ functions $ y_{1}(x),...,y_{n}(x) $ of the given type as function $ s(x)=y_{1}(x)+...+y_{n}(x) $ for any $ x $ . It's easy to show that in this case the graph $ s(x) $ is a polyline. You are given $ n $ functions of the given type, your task is to find the number of angles that do not equal 180 degrees, in the graph $ s(x) $ , that is the sum of the given functions.Valeric and Valerko really want to watch the next Euro Championship game, so they asked you to help them.",
