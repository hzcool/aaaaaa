    "description": "Andrewid the Android is a galaxy-famous detective. He is now chasing a criminal hiding on the planet Oxa-5, the planet almost fully covered with water.\n\nThe only dry land there is an archipelago of $ n $ narrow islands located in a row. For more comfort let's represent them as non-intersecting segments on a straight line: island $ i $ has coordinates $ [l_{i},r_{i}] $ , besides, $ r_{i}&lt;l_{i+1} $ for $ 1<=i<=n-1 $ .\n\nTo reach the goal, Andrewid needs to place a bridge between each pair of adjacent islands. A bridge of length $ a $ can be placed between the $ i $ -th and the $ (i+1) $ -th islads, if there are such coordinates of $ x $ and $ y $ , that $ l_{i}<=x<=r_{i} $ , $ l_{i+1}<=y<=r_{i+1} $ and $ y-x=a $ .\n\nThe detective was supplied with $ m $ bridges, each bridge can be used at most once. Help him determine whether the bridges he got are enough to connect each pair of adjacent islands.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integers $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=2\u00b710^{5} $ ) and $ m $ ( $ 1<=m<=2\u00b710^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of islands and bridges.\n\nNext $ n $ lines each contain two integers $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=10^{18} $ ) \u2014 the coordinates of the island endpoints.\n\nThe last line contains $ m $ integer numbers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{m} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{18} $ ) \u2014 the lengths of the bridges that Andrewid got.",
    "outputFormat": "If it is impossible to place a bridge between each pair of adjacent islands in the required manner, print on a single line \"No\" (without the quotes), otherwise print in the first line \"Yes\" (without the quotes), and in the second line print $ n-1 $ numbers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n-1} $ , which mean that between islands $ i $ and $ i+1 $ there must be used a bridge number $ b_{i} $ .\n\nIf there are multiple correct answers, print any of them. Note that in this problem it is necessary to print \"Yes\" and \"No\" in correct case.",
