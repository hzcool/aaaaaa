    "description": "The student council is preparing for the relay race at the sports festival.\n\nThe council consists of $ n $ members. They will run one after the other in the race, the speed of member $ i $ is $ s_i $ . The discrepancy $ d_i $ of the $ i $ -th stage is the difference between the maximum and the minimum running speed among the first $ i $ members who ran. Formally, if $ a_i $ denotes the speed of the $ i $ -th member who participated in the race, then $ d_i = \\max(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_i) - \\min(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_i) $ .\n\nYou want to minimize the sum of the discrepancies $ d_1 + d_2 + \\dots + d_n $ . To do this, you are allowed to change the order in which the members run. What is the minimum possible sum that can be achieved?",

We have:\n\n- $ d_1 = \\max(2) - \\min(2) = 2 - 2 = 0 $ .\n- $ d_2 = \\max(2, 3) - \\min(2, 3) = 3 - 2 = 1 $ .\n- $ d_3 = \\max(2, 3, 1) - \\min(2, 3, 1) = 3 - 1 = 2 $ .\n\nThe resulting sum is $ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 $ . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a smaller value.\n\nIn the second test case, the only possible rearrangement gives $ d_1 = 0 $ , so the minimum possible result is $ 0 $ .",
