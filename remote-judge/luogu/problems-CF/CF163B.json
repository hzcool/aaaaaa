    "description": "As you know, lemmings like jumping. For the next spectacular group jump $ n $ lemmings gathered near a high rock with $ k $ comfortable ledges on it. The first ledge is situated at the height of $ h $ meters, the second one is at the height of $ 2h $ meters, and so on (the $ i $ -th ledge is at the height of $ i\u00b7h $ meters). The lemmings are going to jump at sunset, and there's not much time left.\n\nEach lemming is characterized by its climbing speed of $ v_{i} $ meters per minute and its weight $ m_{i} $ . This means that the $ i $ -th lemming can climb to the $ j $ -th ledge in ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF163B/30016607ebe88930003ff462753dc7b94c82b700.png) minutes.\n\nTo make the jump beautiful, heavier lemmings should jump from higher ledges: if a lemming of weight $ m_{i} $ jumps from ledge $ i $ , and a lemming of weight $ m_{j} $ jumps from ledge $ j $ (for $ i<j $ ), then the inequation $ m_{i}<=m_{j} $ should be fulfilled.\n\nSince there are $ n $ lemmings and only $ k $ ledges ( $ k<=n $ ), the $ k $ lemmings that will take part in the jump need to be chosen. The chosen lemmings should be distributed on the ledges from $ 1 $ to $ k $ , one lemming per ledge. The lemmings are to be arranged in the order of non-decreasing weight with the increasing height of the ledge. In addition, each lemming should have enough time to get to his ledge, that is, the time of his climb should not exceed $ t $ minutes. The lemmings climb to their ledges all at the same time and they do not interfere with each other.\n\nFind the way to arrange the lemmings' jump so that time $ t $ is minimized.",
