    "description": "Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.\n\nWhen a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state \u2014 sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if $ i $ -th garland is switched on during $ x $ -th second, then it is lit only during seconds $ x $ , $ x+k_{i} $ , $ x+2k_{i} $ , $ x+3k_{i} $ and so on.\n\nMishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers $ x_{1} $ , $ x_{2} $ and $ x_{3} $ (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during $ x_{1} $ -th second, the second one \u2014 during $ x_{2} $ -th second, and the third one \u2014 during $ x_{3} $ -th second, respectively, and during each second starting from $ max(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}) $ at least one garland will be lit.\n\nHelp Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ k_{1} $ , $ k_{2} $ and $ k_{3} $ ( $ 1<=k_{i}<=1500 $ ) \u2014 time intervals of the garlands.",
    "outputFormat": "If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.\n\nOtherwise, print NO.",

    "hint": "In the first example Mishka can choose $ x_{1}=1 $ , $ x_{2}=2 $ , $ x_{3}=1 $ . The first garland will be lit during seconds $ 1,3,5,7,... $ , the second \u2014 $ 2,4,6,8,... $ , which already cover all the seconds after the $ 2 $ -nd one. It doesn't even matter what $ x_{3} $ is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds $ 1,4,7,10,... $ , though.\n\nIn the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.",
