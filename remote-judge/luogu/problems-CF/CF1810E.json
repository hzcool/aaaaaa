    "description": "There is an undirected graph with $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges. Initially, for each vertex $ i $ , there is a monster with danger $ a_{i} $ on that vertex. For a monster with danger $ a_{i} $ , you can defeat it if and only if you have defeated at least $ a_{i} $ other monsters before.\n\nNow you want to defeat all the monsters. First, you choose some vertex $ s $ and defeat the monster on that vertex (since you haven't defeated any monsters before, $ a_{s} $ has to be $ 0 $ ). Then, you can move through the edges. If you want to move from vertex $ u $ to vertex $ v $ , then the following must hold: either the monster on vertex $ v $ has been defeated before, or you can defeat it now. For the second case, you defeat the monster on vertex $ v $ and reach vertex $ v $ .\n\nYou can pass the vertices and the edges any number of times. Determine whether you can defeat all the monsters or not.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Their description follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ , $ m $ ( $ 1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices and edges in the graph respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n} $ ( $ 0 \\le a_{i} \\le n $ ) \u2014 the dangers of monsters on corresponding vertices.\n\nFor the following $ m $ lines, each line contains two integers $ u $ , $ v $ ( $ 1 \\le u, v \\le n $ ), describing an edge connecting vertex $ u $ and vertex $ v $ . It is guaranteed that there are no multi-edges or self-loops in the graph.\n\nIt is guaranteed that both the sum of $ n $ and the sum of $ m $ over all test cases do not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \"YES\" if you can defeat all the monsters, or \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.",
