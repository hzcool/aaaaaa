There are $ n $ trees in a row on an alley in a park, there is a nest on each of the trees. In the $ i $ -th nest there are $ c_{i} $ birds; to summon one bird from this nest Imp needs to stay under this tree and it costs him $ cost_{i} $ points of mana. However, for each bird summoned, Imp increases his mana capacity by $ B $ points. Imp summons birds one by one, he can summon any number from $ 0 $ to $ c_{i} $ birds from the $ i $ -th nest.\n\nInitially Imp stands under the first tree and has $ W $ points of mana, and his mana capacity equals $ W $ as well. He can only go forward, and each time he moves from a tree to the next one, he restores $ X $ points of mana (but it can't exceed his current mana capacity). Moving only forward, what is the maximum number of birds Imp can summon?",

    "hint": "In the first sample base amount of Imp's mana is equal to $ 12 $ (with maximum capacity also equal to $ 12 $ ). After he summons two birds from the first nest, he loses $ 8 $ mana points, although his maximum capacity will not increase (since $ B=0 $ ). After this step his mana will be $ 4 $ of $ 12 $ ; during the move you will replenish $ 4 $ mana points, and hence own $ 8 $ mana out of $ 12 $ possible. Now it's optimal to take $ 4 $ birds from the second nest and spend $ 8 $ mana. The final answer will be \u2014 $ 6 $ .\n\nIn the second sample the base amount of mana is equal to $ 1000 $ . The right choice will be to simply pick all birds from the last nest. Note that Imp's mana doesn't restore while moving because it's initially full.",
