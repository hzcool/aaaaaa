    "description": "Monocarp is playing chess on one popular website. He has $ n $ opponents he can play with. The $ i $ -th opponent has rating equal to $ a_i $ . Monocarp's initial rating is $ x $ . Monocarp wants to raise his rating to the value $ y $ ( $ y > x $ ).\n\nWhen Monocarp is playing against one of the opponents, he will win if his current rating is bigger or equal to the opponent's rating. If Monocarp wins, his rating is increased by $ 1 $ , otherwise it is decreased by $ 1 $ . The rating of his opponent does not change.\n\nMonocarp wants to gain rating $ y $ playing as few games as possible. But he can't just grind it, playing against weak opponents. The website has a rule that you should play against all opponents as evenly as possible. Speaking formally, if Monocarp wants to play against an opponent $ i $ , there should be no other opponent $ j $ such that Monocarp has played more games against $ i $ than against $ j $ .\n\nCalculate the minimum possible number of games Monocarp needs to gain rating $ y $ or say it's impossible. Note that ratings of Monocarp's opponents don't change, while Monocarp's rating does change.",

    "hint": "In the first test case, Monocarp can use the following strategy:\n\n1. Monocarp plays against the $ 2 $ -nd opponent to increase rating ( $ 2 \\to 3 $ );\n2. Monocarp plays against the $ 1 $ -st opponent to increase rating ( $ 3 \\to 4 $ );\n3. Monocarp plays against the $ 4 $ -th opponent to increase rating ( $ 4 \\to 5 $ );\n4. Monocarp plays against the $ 5 $ -th opponent to increase rating ( $ 5 \\to 6 $ );\n5. Now Monocarp have to play with remaining three opponents. So, he will lose $ 3 $ times and get rating $ 3 $ ( $ 6 \\to 5 \\to 4 \\to 3 $ );\n6. After that, Monocarp will repeat steps 1-5 again. After $ 14 $ games, he has played twice with each opponent and get final rating $ 4 $ .\n7. Monocarp plays against the $ 1 $ -st opponent to increase rating ( $ 4 \\to 5 $ );\n8. Monocarp plays against the $ 2 $ -nd opponent to increase rating ( $ 5 \\to 6 $ );\n9. Monocarp plays against the $ 4 $ -th opponent to increase rating ( $ 6 \\to 7 $ );\n10. Monocarp plays against the $ 5 $ -th opponent to increase rating ( $ 7 \\to 8 $ );\n11. Monocarp plays against the $ 7 $ -th opponent to increase rating ( $ 8 \\to 9 $ );\n12. Monocarp plays against the $ 3 $ -rd opponent to increase rating ( $ 9 \\to 10 $ );\n\n In total, Monocarp, played twice against the $ 6 $ -th opponent and three times against other opponents and got rating $ 10 $ in $ 14 + 6 = 20 $ games.In the second test case, it can be proven that whichever games Monocarp plays, he can't get his rating higher than $ 4 $ .",
