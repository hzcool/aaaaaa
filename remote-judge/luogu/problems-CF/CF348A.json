    "description": "One day $ n $ friends gathered together to play \"Mafia\". During each round of the game some player must be the supervisor and other $ n-1 $ people take part in the game. For each person we know in how many rounds he wants to be a player, not the supervisor: the $ i $ -th person wants to play $ a_{i} $ rounds. What is the minimum number of rounds of the \"Mafia\" game they need to play to let each person play at least as many rounds as they want?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (3<=n<=10^{5}) $ . The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=10^{9}) $ \u2014 the $ i $ -th number in the list is the number of rounds the $ i $ -th person wants to play.",
    "outputFormat": "In a single line print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of game rounds the friends need to let the $ i $ -th person play at least $ a_{i} $ rounds.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.",
