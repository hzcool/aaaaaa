    "description": "A little bear Limak plays a game. He has five cards. There is one number written on each card. Each number is a positive integer.\n\nLimak can discard (throw out) some cards. His goal is to minimize the sum of numbers written on remaining (not discarded) cards.\n\nHe is allowed to at most once discard two or three cards with the same number. Of course, he won't discard cards if it's impossible to choose two or three cards with the same number.\n\nGiven five numbers written on cards, cay you find the minimum sum of numbers on remaining cards?",
    "inputFormat": "The only line of the input contains five integers $ t_{1} $ , $ t_{2} $ , $ t_{3} $ , $ t_{4} $ and $ t_{5} $ ( $ 1<=t_{i}<=100 $ ) \u2014 numbers written on cards.",

    "hint": "In the first sample, Limak has cards with numbers $ 7 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 7 $ , $ 3 $ and $ 20 $ . Limak can do one of the following.\n\n- Do nothing and the sum would be $ 7+3+7+3+20=40 $ .\n- Remove two cards with a number $ 7 $ . The remaining sum would be $ 3+3+20=26 $ .\n- Remove two cards with a number $ 3 $ . The remaining sum would be $ 7+7+20=34 $ .\n\nYou are asked to minimize the sum so the answer is $ 26 $ .\n\nIn the second sample, it's impossible to find two or three cards with the same number. Hence, Limak does nothing and the sum is $ 7+9+1+3+8=28 $ .\n\nIn the third sample, all cards have the same number. It's optimal to discard any three cards. The sum of two remaining numbers is $ 10+10=20 $ .",
