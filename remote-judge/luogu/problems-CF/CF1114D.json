    "description": "You are given a line of $ n $ colored squares in a row, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from left to right. The $ i $ -th square initially has the color $ c_i $ .\n\nLet's say, that two squares $ i $ and $ j $ belong to the same connected component if $ c_i = c_j $ , and $ c_i = c_k $ for all $ k $ satisfying $ i < k < j $ . In other words, all squares on the segment from $ i $ to $ j $ should have the same color.\n\nFor example, the line $ [3, 3, 3] $ has $ 1 $ connected component, while the line $ [5, 2, 4, 4] $ has $ 3 $ connected components.\n\nThe game \"flood fill\" is played on the given line as follows:\n\n- At the start of the game you pick any starting square (this is not counted as a turn).\n- Then, in each game turn, change the color of the connected component containing the starting square to any other color.\n\nFind the minimum number of turns needed for the entire line to be changed into a single color.",
