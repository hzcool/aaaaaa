    "description": "Let us call a pair of integer numbers  $ m $ -perfect, if at least one number in the pair is greater than or equal to $ m $ . Thus, the pairs (3, 3) and (0, 2) are 2-perfect while the pair (-1, 1) is not.\n\nTwo integers $ x $ , $ y $ are written on the blackboard. It is allowed to erase one of them and replace it with the sum of the numbers, $ (x+y) $ .\n\nWhat is the minimum number of such operations one has to perform in order to make the given pair of integers $ m $ -perfect?",
    "inputFormat": "Single line of the input contains three integers $ x $ , $ y $ and $ m $ ( $ -10^{18}<=x $ , $ y $ , $ m<=10^{18} $ ).\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.",
