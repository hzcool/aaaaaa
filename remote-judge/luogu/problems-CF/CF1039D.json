    "description": "A tree is an undirected graph with exactly one simple path between each pair of vertices. We call a set of simple paths $ k $ -valid if each vertex of the tree belongs to no more than one of these paths (including endpoints) and each path consists of exactly $ k $ vertices.\n\nYou are given a tree with $ n $ vertices. For each $ k $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ inclusive find what is the maximum possible size of a $ k $ -valid set of simple paths.",
