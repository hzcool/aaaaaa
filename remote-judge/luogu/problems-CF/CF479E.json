    "description": "Imagine that you are in a building that has exactly $ n $ floors. You can move between the floors in a lift. Let's number the floors from bottom to top with integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Now you're on the floor number $ a $ . You are very bored, so you want to take the lift. Floor number $ b $ has a secret lab, the entry is forbidden. However, you already are in the mood and decide to make $ k $ consecutive trips in the lift.\n\nLet us suppose that at the moment you are on the floor number $ x $ (initially, you were on floor $ a $ ). For another trip between floors you choose some floor with number $ y $ ( $ y\u2260x $ ) and the lift travels to this floor. As you cannot visit floor $ b $ with the secret lab, you decided that the distance from the current floor $ x $ to the chosen $ y $ must be strictly less than the distance from the current floor $ x $ to floor $ b $ with the secret lab. Formally, it means that the following inequation must fulfill: $ |x-y|<|x-b| $ . After the lift successfully transports you to floor $ y $ , you write down number $ y $ in your notepad.\n\nYour task is to find the number of distinct number sequences that you could have written in the notebook as the result of $ k $ trips in the lift. As the sought number of trips can be rather large, find the remainder after dividing the number by $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ).",
