    "description": "This is yet another problem on regular bracket sequences.\n\nA bracket sequence is called regular, if by inserting \"+\" and \"1\" into it we get a correct mathematical expression. For example, sequences \"(())()\", \"()\" and \"(()(()))\" are regular, while \")(\", \"(()\" and \"(()))(\" are not. You have a pattern of a bracket sequence that consists of characters \"(\", \")\" and \"?\". You have to replace each character \"?\" with a bracket so, that you get a regular bracket sequence.\n\nFor each character \"?\" the cost of its replacement with \"(\" and \")\" is given. Among all the possible variants your should choose the cheapest.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a non-empty pattern of even length, consisting of characters \"(\", \")\" and \"?\". Its length doesn't exceed $ 5\u00b710^{4} $ . Then there follow $ m $ lines, where $ m $ is the number of characters \"?\" in the pattern. Each line contains two integer numbers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=10^{6} $ ), where $ a_{i} $ is the cost of replacing the $ i $ -th character \"?\" with an opening bracket, and $ b_{i} $ \u2014 with a closing one.",
