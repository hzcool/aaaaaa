    "description": "One day, liouzhou\\_101 got a chat record of Freda and Rainbow. Out of curiosity, he wanted to know which sentences were said by Freda, and which were said by Rainbow. According to his experience, he thought that Freda always said \"lala.\" at the end of her sentences, while Rainbow always said \"miao.\" at the beginning of his sentences. For each sentence in the chat record, help liouzhou\\_101 find whose sentence it is.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10 $ ), number of sentences in the chat record. Each of the next $ n $ lines contains a sentence. A sentence is a string that contains only Latin letters (A-Z, a-z), underline (\\_), comma (,), point (.) and space ( ). Its length doesn\u2019t exceed 100.",
    "outputFormat": "For each sentence, output \"Freda's\" if the sentence was said by Freda, \"Rainbow's\" if the sentence was said by Rainbow, or \"OMG>.< I don't know!\" if liouzhou\\_101 can\u2019t recognize whose sentence it is. He can\u2019t recognize a sentence if it begins with \"miao.\" and ends with \"lala.\", or satisfies neither of the conditions.",
