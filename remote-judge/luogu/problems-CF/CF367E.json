    "description": "Sereja is interested in intervals of numbers, so he has prepared a problem about intervals for you. An interval of numbers is a pair of integers $ [l,r] $ $ (1<=l<=r<=m) $ . Interval $ [l_{1},r_{1}] $ belongs to interval $ [l_{2},r_{2}] $ if the following condition is met: $ l_{2}<=l_{1}<=r_{1}<=r_{2} $ .\n\nSereja wants to write out a sequence of $ n $ intervals $ [l_{1},r_{1}] $ , $ [l_{2},r_{2}] $ , $ ... $ , $ [l_{n},r_{n}] $ on a piece of paper. At that, no interval in the sequence can belong to some other interval of the sequence. Also, Sereja loves number $ x $ very much and he wants some (at least one) interval in the sequence to have $ l_{i}=x $ . Sereja wonders, how many distinct ways to write such intervals are there?\n\nHelp Sereja and find the required number of ways modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .\n\nTwo ways are considered distinct if there is such $ j $ $ (1<=j<=n) $ , that the $ j $ -th intervals in two corresponding sequences are not equal.",
