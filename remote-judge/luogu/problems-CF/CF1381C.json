    "description": "In the game of Mastermind, there are two players \u2014 Alice and Bob. Alice has a secret code, which Bob tries to guess. Here, a code is defined as a sequence of $ n $ colors. There are exactly $ n+1 $ colors in the entire universe, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n+1 $ inclusive.\n\nWhen Bob guesses a code, Alice tells him some information about how good of a guess it is, in the form of two integers $ x $ and $ y $ .\n\nThe first integer $ x $ is the number of indices where Bob's guess correctly matches Alice's code. The second integer $ y $ is the size of the intersection of the two codes as multisets. That is, if Bob were to change the order of the colors in his guess, $ y $ is the maximum number of indices he could get correct.\n\nFor example, suppose $ n=5 $ , Alice's code is $ [3,1,6,1,2] $ , and Bob's guess is $ [3,1,1,2,5] $ . At indices $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ colors are equal, while in the other indices they are not equal. So $ x=2 $ . And the two codes have the four colors $ 1,1,2,3 $ in common, so $ y=4 $ .\n\n  ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1381C/0a0bf21772b2a037969dab6b2775ca2f40f3672c.png) Solid lines denote a matched color for the same index. Dashed lines denote a matched color at a different index. $ x $ is the number of solid lines, and $ y $ is the total number of lines. You are given Bob's guess and two values $ x $ and $ y $ . Can you find one possibility of Alice's code so that the values of $ x $ and $ y $ are correct?",
