She recently came across a (possibly fake) article about the impact of fractal structure on multimedia messages and she is now trying to measure the self-similarity of the message, which is defined as\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF802I/cdbfdfc02921b55d94f8e9715364be36292f81c3.png)where the sum is over all nonempty strings $ p $ and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF802I/aea1d5f3b9f7520d94fcc0daea05a447b5429c82.png) is the number of occurences of $ p $ in $ s $ as a substring. (Note that the sum is infinite, but it only has a finite number of nonzero summands.)\n\nHeidi refuses to do anything else until she knows how to calculate this self-similarity. Could you please help her? (If you would like to instead convince Heidi that a finite string cannot be a fractal anyway \u2013 do not bother, we have already tried.)",
