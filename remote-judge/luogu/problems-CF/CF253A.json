    "description": "There are $ n $ boys and $ m $ girls studying in the class. They should stand in a line so that boys and girls alternated there as much as possible. Let's assume that positions in the line are indexed from left to right by numbers from 1 to $ n+m $ . Then the number of integers $ i $ ( $ 1<=i&lt;n+m $ ) such that positions with indexes $ i $ and $ i+1 $ contain children of different genders (position $ i $ has a girl and position $ i+1 $ has a boy or vice versa) must be as large as possible.\n\nHelp the children and tell them how to form the line.",
    "inputFormat": "The single line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=100 $ ), separated by a space.",
    "outputFormat": "Print a line of $ n+m $ characters. Print on the $ i $ -th position of the line character \"B\", if the $ i $ -th position of your arrangement should have a boy and \"G\", if it should have a girl.\n\nOf course, the number of characters \"B\" should equal $ n $ and the number of characters \"G\" should equal $ m $ . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.",
