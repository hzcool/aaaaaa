    "description": "Consider a grid of size $ n \\times n $ . The rows are numbered top to bottom from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , the columns are numbered left to right from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .\n\nThe robot is positioned in a cell $ (1, 1) $ . It can perform two types of moves:\n\n- D \u2014 move one cell down;\n- R \u2014 move one cell right.\n\nThe robot is not allowed to move outside the grid.\n\nYou are given a sequence of moves $ s $ \u2014 the initial path of the robot. This path doesn't lead the robot outside the grid.\n\nYou are allowed to perform an arbitrary number of modifications to it (possibly, zero). With one modification, you can duplicate one move in the sequence. That is, replace a single occurrence of D with DD or a single occurrence of R with RR.\n\nCount the number of cells such that there exists at least one sequence of modifications that the robot visits this cell on the modified path and doesn't move outside the grid.",

So the only visited cells are the ones that are visited on the path DRDRDRDR.\n\nIn the third testcase, the cells that are visited on at least one modified path are: $ (1, 1) $ , $ (2, 1) $ and $ (3, 1) $ .\n\nHere are the cells for all testcases:\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1644E/8385744beba9b4eb7d29fe889ed5f7f306a3c22f.png)"
