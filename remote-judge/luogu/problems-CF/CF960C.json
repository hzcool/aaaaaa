    "description": "Pikachu had an array with him. He wrote down all the non-empty subsequences of the array on paper. Note that an array of size $ n $ has $ 2^{n}-1 $ non-empty subsequences in it.\n\nPikachu being mischievous as he always is, removed all the subsequences in which Maximum\\_element\\_of\\_the\\_subsequence $ - $ Minimum\\_element\\_of\\_subsequence $ >=d $\n\nPikachu was finally left with $ X $ subsequences.\n\nHowever, he lost the initial array he had, and now is in serious trouble. He still remembers the numbers $ X $ and $ d $ . He now wants you to construct any such array which will satisfy the above conditions. All the numbers in the final array should be positive integers less than $ 10^{18} $ .\n\nNote the number of elements in the output array should not be more than $ 10^{4} $ . If no answer is possible, print $ -1 $ .",

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",

There are $ 10 $ of them. Hence, the array $ [5,50,7,15,6,100] $ is valid.\n\nSimilarly, in the output of the second example case, the remaining sub-sequences after removing those with Maximum\\_element\\_of\\_the\\_subsequence $ - $ Minimum\\_element\\_of\\_subsequence $ >=2 $ are $ [10],[100],[1000],[10000] $ .
