    "description": "Appleman has $ n $ cards. Each card has an uppercase letter written on it. Toastman must choose $ k $ cards from Appleman's cards. Then Appleman should give Toastman some coins depending on the chosen cards. Formally, for each Toastman's card $ i $ you should calculate how much Toastman's cards have the letter equal to letter on $ i $ th, then sum up all these quantities, such a number of coins Appleman should give to Toastman.\n\nGiven the description of Appleman's cards. What is the maximum number of coins Toastman can get?",
