    "description": "Sereja placed $ n $ points on a plane. Now Sereja wants to place on the plane two straight lines, intersecting at a right angle, so that one of the straight lines intersect the $ Ox $ axis at an angle of $ 45 $ degrees and the maximum distance from the points to the straight lines were minimum.\n\nIn this problem we consider the distance between points $ (x_{1},y_{1}) $ and $ (x_{2},y_{2}) $ equal $ |x_{1}-x_{2}|+|y_{1}-y_{2}| $ . The distance between the point and the straight lines is the minimum distance from the point to some point belonging to one of the lines.\n\nHelp Sereja, find the maximum distance from the points to the optimally located straight lines.",
