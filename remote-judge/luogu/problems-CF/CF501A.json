    "description": "Misha and Vasya participated in a Codeforces contest. Unfortunately, each of them solved only one problem, though successfully submitted it at the first attempt. Misha solved the problem that costs $ a $ points and Vasya solved the problem that costs $ b $ points. Besides, Misha submitted the problem $ c $ minutes after the contest started and Vasya submitted the problem $ d $ minutes after the contest started. As you know, on Codeforces the cost of a problem reduces as a round continues. That is, if you submit a problem that costs $ p $ points $ t $ minutes after the contest started, you get ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF501A/0c1954e97a47d9a6cd1567e3d0ad4f4a76ada737.png) points.\n\nMisha and Vasya are having an argument trying to find out who got more points. Help them to find out the truth.",
