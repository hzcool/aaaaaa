    "description": "While Mike was walking in the subway, all the stuff in his back-bag dropped on the ground. There were several fax messages among them. He concatenated these strings in some order and now he has string $ s $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF548A/8e6eb6a5966077211062d31ebdd4df5e9f389a77.png)He is not sure if this is his own back-bag or someone else's. He remembered that there were exactly $ k $ messages in his own bag, each was a palindrome string and all those strings had the same length.\n\nHe asked you to help him and tell him if he has worn his own back-bag. Check if the given string $ s $ is a concatenation of $ k $ palindromes of the same length.",
