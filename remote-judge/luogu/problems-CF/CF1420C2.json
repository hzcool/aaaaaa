    "description": "This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.\n\nPikachu is a cute and friendly pok\u00e9mon living in the wild pikachu herd.\n\nBut it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pok\u00e9mon! Pok\u00e9mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok\u00e9mon army to resist.\n\nFirst, Andrew counted all the pok\u00e9mon \u2014 there were exactly $ n $ pikachu. The strength of the $ i $ -th pok\u00e9mon is equal to $ a_i $ , and all these numbers are distinct.\n\nAs an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $ b $ from $ k $ indices such that $ 1 \\le b_1 < b_2 < \\dots < b_k \\le n $ , and his army will consist of pok\u00e9mons with forces $ a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \\dots, a_{b_k} $ .\n\nThe strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $ a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \\dots $ .\n\nAndrew is experimenting with pok\u00e9mon order. He performs $ q $ operations. In $ i $ -th operation Andrew swaps $ l_i $ -th and $ r_i $ -th pok\u00e9mon.\n\nAndrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok\u00e9mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.\n\nHelp Andrew and the pok\u00e9mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!",
