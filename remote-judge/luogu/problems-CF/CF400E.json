    "description": "Inna is fed up with jokes about female logic. So she started using binary logic instead.\n\nInna has an array of $ n $ elements $ a_{1}[1],a_{1}[2],...,a_{1}[n] $ . Girl likes to train in her binary logic, so she does an exercise consisting of $ n $ stages: on the first stage Inna writes out all numbers from array $ a_{1} $ , on the $ i $ -th $ (i>=2) $ stage girl writes all elements of array $ a_{i} $ , which consists of $ n-i+1 $ integers; the $ k $ -th integer of array $ a_{i} $ is defined as follows: $ a_{i}[k]=a_{i-1}[k]\u00a0AND\u00a0a_{i-1}[k+1] $ . Here AND is bit-wise binary logical operation.\n\nDima decided to check Inna's skill. He asks Inna to change array, perform the exercise and say the sum of all ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF400E/150441d31156a32e0b2da63844d600138a543898.png) elements she wrote out during the current exercise.\n\nHelp Inna to answer the questions!",

Each question consists of two integers $ p_{i},v_{i} $ $ (1<=p_{i}<=n;\u00a00<=v_{i}<=10^{5}) $ . For this question Inna should make $ a_{1}[p_{i}] $ equals $ v_{i} $ , and then perform the exercise.
