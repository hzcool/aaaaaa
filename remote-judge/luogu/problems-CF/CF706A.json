    "description": "Vasiliy lives at point $ (a,b) $ of the coordinate plane. He is hurrying up to work so he wants to get out of his house as soon as possible. New app suggested $ n $ available Beru-taxi nearby. The $ i $ -th taxi is located at point $ (x_{i},y_{i}) $ and moves with a speed $ v_{i} $ .\n\nConsider that each of $ n $ drivers will move directly to Vasiliy and with a maximum possible speed. Compute the minimum time when Vasiliy will get in any of Beru-taxi cars.",
