    "description": "Let $ T $ be a tree on $ n $ vertices. Consider a graph $ G_0 $ , initially equal to $ T $ . You are given a sequence of $ q $ updates, where the $ i $ -th update is given as a pair of two distinct integers $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ .\n\nFor every $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ q $ , we define the graph $ G_i $ as follows:\n\n- If $ G_{i-1} $ contains an edge $ \\{u_i, v_i\\} $ , then remove this edge to form $ G_i $ .\n- Otherwise, add this edge to $ G_{i-1} $ to form $ G_i $ .\n\nFormally, $ G_i := G_{i-1} \\triangle \\{\\{u_i, v_i\\}\\} $ where $ \\triangle $ denotes the set [symmetric difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference).\n\nFurthermore, it is guaranteed that $ T $ is always a subgraph of $ G_i $ . In other words, an update never removes an edge of $ T $ .\n\nConsider a connected graph $ H $ and run a depth-first search on it. One can see that the tree edges (i.e. the edges leading to a not yet visited vertex at the time of traversal) form a spanning tree of the graph $ H $ . This spanning tree is not generally fixed for a particular graph \u2014 it depends on the starting vertex, and on the order in which the neighbors of each vertex are traversed.\n\nWe call vertex $ w $ good if one can order the neighbors of each vertex in such a way that the depth-first search started from $ w $ produces $ T $ as the spanning tree. For every $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ q $ , find and report the number of good vertices.",

    "hint": "The first sample is depicted in the following figure.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1044F/6fe1ac052613262c6f3f2a25dd747a307a471728.png)After the first update, $ G $ contains all three possible edges. The result of a DFS is as follows:\n\n- Let the starting vertex be $ 1 $ . We have two choices of ordering the neighbors of $ 1 $ , either $ [2, 3] $ or $ [3, 2] $ . \n  - If we choose the former, then we reach vertex $ 2 $ . Regardless of the ordering of its neighbors, the next visited vertex will be $ 3 $ . Thus, the spanning tree generated by this DFS will contain edges $ \\{1, 2\\} $ and $ \\{2, 3\\} $ , which does not equal to $ T $ .\n  - If we choose the latter, we obtain a spanning tree with edges $ \\{1, 3\\} $ and $ \\{2, 3\\} $ .\n  \n   Hence, there is no way of ordering the neighbors of vertices such that the DFS produces $ T $ , and subsequently $ 1 $ is not a good vertex.\n- Let the starting vertex be $ 2 $ . We have two choices of traversing its neighbors. If we visit $ 3 $ first, then the spanning tree will consist of edges $ \\{2,3\\} $ and $ \\{1,3\\} $ , which is not equal to $ T $ . If we, however, visit $ 1 $ first, then we can only continue to $ 3 $ from here, and the spanning tree will consist of edges $ \\{1, 2\\} $ and $ \\{1,3\\} $ , which equals to $ T $ . Hence, $ 2 $ is a good vertex.\n- The case when we start in the vertex $ 3 $ is symmetrical to starting in $ 2 $ , and hence $ 3 $ is a good vertex.\n\n Therefore, the answer is $ 2 $ .After the second update, the edge between $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ is removed, and $ G = T $ . It follows that the spanning tree generated by DFS will be always equal to $ T $ independent of the choice of the starting vertex. Thus, the answer is $ 3 $ .\n\nIn the second sample, the set of good vertices after the corresponding query is:\n\n- $ \\{2, 3, 5\\} $\n- $ \\{3, 5\\} $\n- $ \\{3, 4, 5\\} $\n- $ \\{4, 5\\} $\n- $ \\{4, 5, 6\\} $\n- $ \\{5, 6\\} $",
