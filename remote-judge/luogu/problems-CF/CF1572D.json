    "description": "There are currently $ n $ hot topics numbered from $ 0 $ to $ n-1 $ at your local bridge club and $ 2^n $ players numbered from $ 0 $ to $ 2^n-1 $ . Each player holds a different set of views on those $ n $ topics, more specifically, the $ i $ -th player holds a positive view on the $ j $ -th topic if $ i\\ \\&\\ 2^j > 0 $ , and a negative view otherwise. Here $ \\& $ denotes the [bitwise AND operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND).\n\nYou are going to organize a bridge tournament capable of accommodating at most $ k $ pairs of players (bridge is played in teams of two people). You can select teams arbitrarily while each player is in at most one team, but there is one catch: two players cannot be in the same pair if they disagree on $ 2 $ or more of those $ n $ topics, as they would argue too much during the play.\n\nYou know that the $ i $ -th player will pay you $ a_i $ dollars if they play in this tournament. Compute the maximum amount of money that you can earn if you pair the players in your club optimally.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ , $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 20 $ , $ 1 \\le k \\le 200 $ ) \u2014 the number of hot topics and the number of pairs of players that your tournament can accommodate.\n\nThe second line contains $ 2^n $ integers $ a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{2^n-1} $ ( $ 0 \\le a_i \\le 10^6 $ ) \u2014 the amounts of money that the players will pay to play in the tournament.",

    "hint": "In the first example, the best we can do is to pair together the $ 0 $ -th player and the $ 2 $ -nd player resulting in earnings of $ 8 + 5 = 13 $ dollars. Although pairing the $ 0 $ -th player with the $ 5 $ -th player would give us $ 8 + 10 = 18 $ dollars, we cannot do this because those two players disagree on $ 2 $ of the $ 3 $ hot topics.\n\nIn the second example, we can pair the $ 0 $ -th player with the $ 1 $ -st player and pair the $ 2 $ -nd player with the $ 3 $ -rd player resulting in earnings of $ 7 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 23 $ dollars.",
