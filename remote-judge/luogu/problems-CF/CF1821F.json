    "description": "There is a beautiful alley with trees in front of a shopping mall. Unfortunately, it has to go to make space for the parking lot.\n\nThe trees on the alley all grow in a single line. There are $ n $ spots for trees, index $ 0 $ is the shopping mall, index $ n+1 $ is the road and indices from $ 1 $ to $ n $ are the spots for trees. Some of them are taken \u2014 there grow trees of the same height $ k $ . No more than one tree grows in each spot.\n\nWhen you chop down a tree in the spot $ x $ , you can make it fall either left or right. If it falls to the left, it takes up spots from $ x-k $ to $ x $ , inclusive. If it falls to the right, it takes up spots from $ x $ to $ x+k $ , inclusive.\n\nLet $ m $ trees on the alley grow in some spots $ x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_m $ . Let an alley be called unfortunate if all $ m $ trees can be chopped down in such a way that:\n\n- no tree falls on the shopping mall or the road;\n- each spot is taken up by no more than one fallen tree.\n\nCalculate the number of different unfortunate alleys with $ m $ trees of height $ k $ . Two alleys are considered different if there is a spot $ y $ such that a tree grows in $ y $ on the first alley and doesn't grow in $ y $ on the second alley.\n\nOutput the number modulo $ 998\\,244\\,353 $ .",
