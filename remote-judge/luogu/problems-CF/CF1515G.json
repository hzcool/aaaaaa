    "description": "In Fire City, there are $ n $ intersections and $ m $ one-way roads. The $ i $ -th road goes from intersection $ a_i $ to $ b_i $ and has length $ l_i $ miles.\n\nThere are $ q $ cars that may only drive along those roads. The $ i $ -th car starts at intersection $ v_i $ and has an odometer that begins at $ s_i $ , increments for each mile driven, and resets to $ 0 $ whenever it reaches $ t_i $ . Phoenix has been tasked to drive cars along some roads (possibly none) and return them to their initial intersection with the odometer showing $ 0 $ .\n\nFor each car, please find if this is possible.\n\nA car may visit the same road or intersection an arbitrary number of times. The odometers don't stop counting the distance after resetting, so odometers may also be reset an arbitrary number of times.",
