    "description": "A simplified arithmetic expression (SAE) is an arithmetic expression defined by the following grammar:\n\n- <SAE> ::= <Number> | <SAE>+<SAE> | <SAE>\\*<SAE> | (<SAE>)\n- <Number> ::= <Digit> | <Digit><Number>\n- <Digit> ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n\nIn other words it's a correct arithmetic expression that is allowed to contain brackets, numbers (possibly with leading zeros), multiplications and additions. For example expressions \"(0+01)\", \"0\" and \"1\\*(0)\" are simplified arithmetic expressions, but expressions \"2-1\", \"+1\" and \"1+2)\" are not.\n\nGiven a string $ s_{1}s_{2}...s_{|s|} $ that represents a SAE; $ s_{i} $ denotes the $ i $ -th character of the string which can be either a digit ('0'-'9'), a plus sign ('+'), a multiplication sign ('\\*'), an opening round bracket '(' or a closing round bracket ')'.\n\nA part $ s_{l}s_{l+1}...s_{r} $ of this string is called a sub-expression if and only if it is a SAE.\n\nYou task is to answer $ m $ queries, each of which is a pair of integers $ l_{i} $ , $ r_{i} $ $ (1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=|s|) $ . For each query determine whether the corresponding part of the given string is a sub-expression and in case it's a sub-expression calculate its value modulo $ 1000000007\u00a0(10^{9}+7) $ . The values should be calculated using standard operator priorities.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains non-empty string $ s $ $ (1<=|s|<=4\u00b710^{5}) $ which represents a correct SAE. Each character of the string can be one of the following characters: '\\*', '+', '(', ')' or a digit ('0'-'9'). The expression might contain extra-huge numbers.\n\nThe second line contains an integer $ m $ $ (1<=m<=4\u00b710^{5}) $ which is the number of queries. Each of the next $ m $ lines contains two space-separated integers $ l_{i} $ , $ r_{i} $ $ (1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=|s|) $ \u2014 the $ i $ -th query.",
    "outputFormat": "The $ i $ -th number of output should be the answer for the $ i $ -th query. If the $ i $ -th query corresponds to a valid sub-expression output the value of the sub-expression modulo $ 1000000007\u00a0(10^{9}+7) $ . Otherwise output -1 as an answer for the query. Print numbers on separate lines.",
