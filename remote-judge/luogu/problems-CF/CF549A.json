    "description": "The developers of Looksery have to write an efficient algorithm that detects faces on a picture. Unfortunately, they are currently busy preparing a contest for you, so you will have to do it for them.\n\nIn this problem an image is a rectangular table that consists of lowercase Latin letters. A face on the image is a $ 2\u00d72 $ square, such that from the four letters of this square you can make word \"face\".\n\nYou need to write a program that determines the number of faces on the image. The squares that correspond to the faces can overlap.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two space-separated integers, $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=50 $ ) \u2014 the height and the width of the image, respectively.\n\nNext $ n $ lines define the image. Each line contains $ m $ lowercase Latin letters.",
