    "description": "Princess Vlada enjoys springing in the meadows and walking in the forest. One day \u2014 wonderful, sunny day \u2014 during her walk Princess found out with astonishment that her shadow was missing! \"Blimey!\", \u2014 she thought and started her search of the shadow in the forest.\n\nNormally the Shadow is too lazy and simply sleeps under the Princess. But at this terrifically hot summer day she got bored of such a dull life, so she decided to play with Vlada.\n\nThe forest, where our characters entertain themselves, may be represented as a set of integer cells in the plane, where the Shadow and the Princess can move only up, down, left and right by $ 1 $ . Some cells (as it happens in decent forests) are occupied by trees. The Shadow and the Princess are not allowed to enter a cell occupied by a tree. Unfortunately, these are the hard times for the forest, so there are very few trees growing here...\n\nAt first the Princess was walking within the cell ( $ v_{x} $ , $ v_{y} $ ), while the Shadow hid from the Princess in the cell ( $ s_{x} $ , $ s_{y} $ ). The Princess, The Shadow and the trees are located in the different cells.\n\nThe Shadow is playing with the Princess. As soon as the Princess moves by $ 1 $ in some direction, the Shadow simultaneously flies by $ 1 $ in the same direction, if it is possible (if the cell to fly to is not occupied by some tree); otherwise, the Shadow doesn't move. The Shadow is very shadowy, so our characters do not interfere with each other.\n\nWe say that the Shadow is caught by the Princess if after some move both of them are located in the same cell. Vlada managed to catch her Shadow! Can you?",
    "inputFormat": "First line of the input contains the coordinates of the characters $ v_{x} $ , $ v_{y} $ , $ s_{x} $ , $ s_{y} $ and the number of trees $ m $ ( $ 0<=m<=400 $ ). The following $ m $ lines contain the coordinates of the trees.\n\nAll the coordinates are integers between -100 and 100, inclusive. The Princess, The Shadow and the trees are located in the different cells.",
    "outputFormat": "If it is impossible for the Princess to catch the Shadow, print \"-1\" (without quotes).\n\nOtherwise print a sequence of characters \"L\", \"R\", \"D\", \"U\", corresponding to the Princess's moves, following which she will be able to catch the Shadow at some turn (L \u2014 move to the left, R \u2014 to the right, U \u2014 up, D \u2014 down; axis $ x $ is directed to the right, $ y $ \u2014 up).\n\nThe number of characters (that is, the number of moves) must not exceed $ 10^{6} $ . All the Princess's moves should be correct, that is must not lead to the cell where a tree grows. It is allowed for the Princess and the Shadow to occupy the same cell before the last turn.",
