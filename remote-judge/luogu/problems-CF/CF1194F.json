    "description": "Today Adilbek is taking his probability theory test. Unfortunately, when Adilbek arrived at the university, there had already been a long queue of students wanting to take the same test. Adilbek has estimated that he will be able to start the test only $ T $ seconds after coming.\n\nFortunately, Adilbek can spend time without revising any boring theorems or formulas. He has an app on this smartphone which contains $ n $ Japanese crosswords to solve. Adilbek has decided to solve them all one by one in the order they are listed in the app, without skipping any crossword. For each crossword, a number $ t_i $ is given that represents the time it takes an average crossword expert to solve this crossword (the time is given in seconds).\n\nAdilbek is a true crossword expert, but, unfortunately, he is sometimes unlucky in choosing the way to solve the crossword. So, it takes him either $ t_i $ seconds or $ t_i + 1 $ seconds to solve the $ i $ -th crossword, equiprobably (with probability $ \\frac{1}{2} $ he solves the crossword in exactly $ t_i $ seconds, and with probability $ \\frac{1}{2} $ he has to spend an additional second to finish the crossword). All these events are independent.\n\nAfter $ T $ seconds pass (or after solving the last crossword, if he manages to do it in less than $ T $ seconds), Adilbek closes the app (if he finishes some crossword at the same moment, that crossword is considered solved; otherwise Adilbek does not finish solving the current crossword at all). He thinks it would be an interesting probability theory problem to calculate $ E $ \u2014 the expected number of crosswords he will be able to solve completely. Can you calculate it?\n\nRecall that the expected value of a discrete random variable is the probability-weighted average of all possible values \u2014 in this problem it means that the expected value of the number of solved crosswords can be calculated as $ E = \\sum \\limits_{i = 0}^{n} i p_i $ , where $ p_i $ is the probability that Adilbek will solve exactly $ i $ crosswords.\n\nWe can represent $ E $ as rational fraction $ \\frac{P}{Q} $ with $ Q > 0 $ . To give the answer, you should print $ P \\cdot Q^{-1} \\bmod (10^9 + 7) $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ T $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ , $ 1 \\le T \\le 2 \\cdot 10^{14} $ ) \u2014 the number of crosswords and the time Adilbek has to spend, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_n $ ( $ 1 \\le t_i \\le 10^9 $ ), where $ t_i $ is the time it takes a crossword expert to solve the $ i $ -th crossword.\n\nNote that Adilbek solves the crosswords in the order they are given in the input without skipping any of them.",
