    "description": "Vasya has recently started to learn English. Now he needs to remember how to write English letters. He isn't sure about some of them, so he decided to train a little.\n\nHe found a sheet of squared paper and began writing arbitrary English letters there. In the end Vasya wrote $ n $ lines containing $ m $ characters each. Thus, he got a rectangular $ n\u00d7m $ table, each cell of the table contained some English letter. Let's number the table rows from top to bottom with integers from 1 to $ n $ , and columns \u2014 from left to right with integers from 1 to $ m $ .\n\nAfter that Vasya looked at the resulting rectangular table and wondered, how many subtables are there, that matches both following conditions:\n\n- the subtable contains at most $ k $ cells with \"a\" letter;\n- all letters, located in all four corner cells of the subtable, are equal.\n\nFormally, a subtable's definition is as follows. It is defined by four integers $ x_{1},y_{1},x_{2},y_{2} $ such that $ 1<=x_{1}&lt;x_{2}<=n $ , $ 1<=y_{1}&lt;y_{2}<=m $ . Then the subtable contains all such cells $ (x,y) $ ( $ x $ is the row number, $ y $ is the column number), for which the following inequality holds $ x_{1}<=x<=x_{2},y_{1}<=y<=y_{2} $ . The corner cells of the table are cells $ (x_{1},y_{1}) $ , $ (x_{1},y_{2}) $ , $ (x_{2},y_{1}) $ , $ (x_{2},y_{2}) $ .\n\nVasya is already too tired after he's been writing letters to a piece of paper. That's why he asks you to count the value he is interested in.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ n,m,k $ $ (2<=n,m<=400;\u00a00<=k<=n\u00b7m) $ .\n\nNext $ n $ lines contain $ m $ characters each \u2014 the given table. Each character of the table is a lowercase English letter.",
