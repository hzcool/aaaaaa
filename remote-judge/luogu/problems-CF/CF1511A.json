    "description": "You are an upcoming movie director, and you have just released your first movie. You have also launched a simple review site with two buttons to press \u2014 upvote and downvote.\n\nHowever, the site is not so simple on the inside. There are two servers, each with its separate counts for the upvotes and the downvotes.\n\n $ n $ reviewers enter the site one by one. Each reviewer is one of the following types:\n\n- type $ 1 $ : a reviewer has watched the movie, and they like it \u2014 they press the upvote button;\n- type $ 2 $ : a reviewer has watched the movie, and they dislike it \u2014 they press the downvote button;\n- type $ 3 $ : a reviewer hasn't watched the movie \u2014 they look at the current number of upvotes and downvotes of the movie on the server they are in and decide what button to press. If there are more downvotes than upvotes, then a reviewer downvotes the movie. Otherwise, they upvote the movie.\n\nEach reviewer votes on the movie exactly once.\n\nSince you have two servers, you can actually manipulate the votes so that your movie gets as many upvotes as possible. When a reviewer enters a site, you know their type, and you can send them either to the first server or to the second one.\n\nWhat is the maximum total number of upvotes you can gather over both servers if you decide which server to send each reviewer to?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThen the descriptions of $ t $ testcases follow.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 50 $ ) \u2014 the number of reviewers.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains $ n $ integers $ r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_n $ ( $ 1 \\le r_i \\le 3 $ ) \u2014 the types of the reviewers in the same order they enter the site.",

    "hint": "In the first testcase of the example you can send the only reviewer to either of the servers \u2014 they'll downvote anyway. The movie won't receive any upvotes.\n\nIn the second testcase of the example you can send all reviewers to the first server:\n\n- the first reviewer upvotes;\n- the second reviewer downvotes;\n- the last reviewer sees that the number of downvotes is not greater than the number of upvotes \u2014 upvote themselves.\n\nThere are two upvotes in total. Alternatevely, you can send the first and the second reviewers to the first server and the last reviewer \u2014 to the second server:\n\n- the first reviewer upvotes on the first server;\n- the second reviewer downvotes on the first server;\n- the last reviewer sees no upvotes or downvotes on the second server \u2014 upvote themselves.",
