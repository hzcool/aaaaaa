    "description": "A progress bar is an element of graphical interface that displays the progress of a process for this very moment before it is completed. Let's take a look at the following form of such a bar.\n\nA bar is represented as $ n $ squares, located in line. To add clarity, let's number them with positive integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from the left to the right. Each square has saturation ( $ a_{i} $ for the $ i $ -th square), which is measured by an integer from $ 0 $ to $ k $ . When the bar for some $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) is displayed, squares $ 1,2,...\\ ,i-1 $ has the saturation $ k $ , squares $ i+1,i+2,...\\ ,n $ has the saturation $ 0 $ , and the saturation of the square $ i $ can have any value from $ 0 $ to $ k $ .\n\nSo some first squares of the progress bar always have the saturation $ k $ . Some last squares always have the saturation $ 0 $ . And there is no more than one square that has the saturation different from $ 0 $ and $ k $ .\n\nThe degree of the process's completion is measured in percents. Let the process be $ t $ % completed. Then the following inequation is fulfilled:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF71B/4e9efb78cef50edf8afa424b4903c5e6bf3cc77f.png)An example of such a bar can be seen on the picture.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF71B/151c399de3b500275514615e73a7da37fbaf060b.png)For the given $ n $ , $ k $ , $ t $ determine the measures of saturation for all the squares $ a_{i} $ of the progress bar.",
