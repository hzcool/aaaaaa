    "description": "Meanwhile, the kingdom of K is getting ready for the marriage of the King's daughter. However, in order not to lose face in front of the relatives, the King should first finish reforms in his kingdom. As the King can not wait for his daughter's marriage, reforms must be finished as soon as possible.\n\nThe kingdom currently consists of $ n $ cities. Cities are connected by $ n-1 $ bidirectional road, such that one can get from any city to any other city. As the King had to save a lot, there is only one path between any two cities.\n\nWhat is the point of the reform? The key ministries of the state should be relocated to distinct cities (we call such cities important). However, due to the fact that there is a high risk of an attack by barbarians it must be done carefully. The King has made several plans, each of which is described by a set of important cities, and now wonders what is the best plan.\n\nBarbarians can capture some of the cities that are not important (the important ones will have enough protection for sure), after that the captured city becomes impassable. In particular, an interesting feature of the plan is the minimum number of cities that the barbarians need to capture in order to make all the important cities isolated, that is, from all important cities it would be impossible to reach any other important city.\n\nHelp the King to calculate this characteristic for each of his plan.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ ) \u2014 the number of cities in the kingdom.\n\nEach of the next $ n-1 $ lines contains two distinct integers $ u_{i} $ , $ v_{i} $ ( $ 1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n $ ) \u2014 the indices of the cities connected by the $ i $ -th road. It is guaranteed that you can get from any city to any other one moving only along the existing roads.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=100000 $ ) \u2014 the number of King's plans.\n\nEach of the next $ q $ lines looks as follows: first goes number $ k_{i} $ \u2014 the number of important cities in the King's plan, ( $ 1<=k_{i}<=n $ ), then follow exactly $ k_{i} $ space-separated pairwise distinct numbers from 1 to $ n $ \u2014 the numbers of important cities in this plan.\n\nThe sum of all $ k_{i} $ 's does't exceed $ 100000 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each plan print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of cities that the barbarians need to capture, or print $ -1 $ if all the barbarians' attempts to isolate important cities will not be effective.",
