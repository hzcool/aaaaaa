    "description": "There is an infinite line consisting of cells. There are $ n $ boxes in some cells of this line. The $ i $ -th box stands in the cell $ a_i $ and has weight $ w_i $ . All $ a_i $ are distinct, moreover, $ a_{i - 1} < a_i $ holds for all valid $ i $ .\n\nYou would like to put together some boxes. Putting together boxes with indices in the segment $ [l, r] $ means that you will move some of them in such a way that their positions will form some segment $ [x, x + (r - l)] $ .\n\nIn one step you can move any box to a neighboring cell if it isn't occupied by another box (i.e. you can choose $ i $ and change $ a_i $ by $ 1 $ , all positions should remain distinct). You spend $ w_i $ units of energy moving the box $ i $ by one cell. You can move any box any number of times, in arbitrary order.\n\nSometimes weights of some boxes change, so you have queries of two types:\n\n1. $ id $ $ nw $ \u2014 weight $ w_{id} $ of the box $ id $ becomes $ nw $ .\n2. $ l $ $ r $ \u2014 you should compute the minimum total energy needed to put together boxes with indices in $ [l, r] $ . Since the answer can be rather big, print the remainder it gives when divided by $ 1000\\,000\\,007 = 10^9 + 7 $ . Note that the boxes are not moved during the query, you only should compute the answer.\n\nNote that you should minimize the answer, not its remainder modulo $ 10^9 + 7 $ . So if you have two possible answers $ 2 \\cdot 10^9 + 13 $ and $ 2 \\cdot 10^9 + 14 $ , you should choose the first one and print $ 10^9 + 6 $ , even though the remainder of the second answer is $ 0 $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of boxes and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the positions of the boxes. All $ a_i $ are distinct, $ a_{i - 1} < a_i $ holds for all valid $ i $ .\n\nThe third line contains $ n $ integers $ w_1, w_2, \\dots w_n $ ( $ 1 \\le w_i \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the initial weights of the boxes.\n\nNext $ q $ lines describe queries, one query per line.\n\nEach query is described in a single line, containing two integers $ x $ and $ y $ . If $ x < 0 $ , then this query is of the first type, where $ id = -x $ , $ nw = y $ ( $ 1 \\le id \\le n $ , $ 1 \\le nw \\le 10^9 $ ). If $ x > 0 $ , then the query is of the second type, where $ l = x $ and $ r = y $ ( $ 1 \\le l_j \\le r_j \\le n $ ). $ x $ can not be equal to $ 0 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each query of the second type print the answer on a separate line. Since answer can be large, print the remainder it gives when divided by $ 1000\\,000\\,007 = 10^9 + 7 $ .",
