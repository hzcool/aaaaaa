For each row and each column the number of contiguous black segments is specified.\n\nFor example if size of the field is $ n=3,m=5 $ , \u0430nd numbers of contiguous black segments in rows are: $ [2,3,2] $ and in columns are: $ [1,0,1,2,1] $ then the solution may look like:\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF534F/6475e8c66c897f247015722a0394e139a91bb231.png)It is guaranteed that on each test in the testset there exists at least one solution.",
