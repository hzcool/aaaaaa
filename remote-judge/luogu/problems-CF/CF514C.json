    "description": "Watto, the owner of a spare parts store, has recently got an order for the mechanism that can process strings in a certain way. Initially the memory of the mechanism is filled with $ n $ strings. Then the mechanism should be able to process queries of the following type: \"Given string $ s $ , determine if the memory of the mechanism contains string $ t $ that consists of the same number of characters as $ s $ and differs from $ s $ in exactly one position\".\n\nWatto has already compiled the mechanism, all that's left is to write a program for it and check it on the data consisting of $ n $ initial lines and $ m $ queries. He decided to entrust this job to you.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two non-negative numbers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 0<=n<=3\u00b710^{5} $ , $ 0<=m<=3\u00b710^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of the initial strings and the number of queries, respectively.\n\nNext follow $ n $ non-empty strings that are uploaded to the memory of the mechanism.\n\nNext follow $ m $ non-empty strings that are the queries to the mechanism.\n\nThe total length of lines in the input doesn't exceed $ 6\u00b710^{5} $ . Each line consists only of letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.",
    "outputFormat": "For each query print on a single line \"YES\" (without the quotes), if the memory of the mechanism contains the required string, otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).",
