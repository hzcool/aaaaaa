    "description": "You have $ n $ stacks of blocks. The $ i $ -th stack contains $ h_i $ blocks and it's height is the number of blocks in it. In one move you can take a block from the $ i $ -th stack (if there is at least one block) and put it to the $ i + 1 $ -th stack. Can you make the sequence of heights strictly increasing?\n\nNote that the number of stacks always remains $ n $ : stacks don't disappear when they have $ 0 $ blocks.",
    "inputFormat": "First line contains a single integer $ t $ $ (1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4) $ \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ $ (1 \\leq n \\leq 100) $ . The second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ h_i $ $ (0 \\leq h_i \\leq 10^9) $ \u2014 starting heights of the stacks.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of all $ n $ does not exceed $ 10^4 $ .",

Then the heights become $ 0 $ $ 1 $ .\n\nIn the third test case we could move one block from the first stack to the second and then from the second to the third, which would make the heights $ 3 $ $ 4 $ $ 5 $ .\n\nIn the fourth test case we can't make a move, but the sequence is not increasing, so the answer is NO.\n\nIn the fifth test case we can only make one move (from the second to the third stack), which would make the heights $ 0 $ $ 0 $ $ 1 $ . Both $ 0 $ $ 1 $ $ 0 $ and $ 0 $ $ 0 $ $ 1 $ are not increasing sequences, so the answer is NO.",
