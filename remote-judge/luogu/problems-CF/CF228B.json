    "description": "You've got two rectangular tables with sizes $ n_{a}\u00d7m_{a} $ and $ n_{b}\u00d7m_{b} $ cells. The tables consist of zeroes and ones. We will consider the rows and columns of both tables indexed starting from 1. Then we will define the element of the first table, located at the intersection of the $ i $ -th row and the $ j $ -th column, as $ a_{i,j} $ ; we will define the element of the second table, located at the intersection of the $ i $ -th row and the $ j $ -th column, as $ b_{i,j} $ .\n\nWe will call the pair of integers $ (x,y) $ a shift of the second table relative to the first one. We'll call the overlap factor of the shift $ (x,y) $ value:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF228B/c8b35e92513beb4ad9da1bdc163ba5b2d1a279ba.png)where the variables $ i,j $ take only such values, in which the expression $ a_{i,j}\u00b7b_{i+x,j+y} $ makes sense. More formally, inequalities $ 1<=i<=n_{a},1<=j<=m_{a},1<=i+x<=n_{b},1<=j+y<=m_{b} $ must hold. If there are no values of variables $ i,j $ , that satisfy the given inequalities, the value of the sum is considered equal to 0.\n\nYour task is to find the shift with the maximum overlap factor among all possible shifts.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n_{a},m_{a} $ $ (1<=n_{a},m_{a}<=50) $ \u2014 the number of rows and columns in the first table. Then $ n_{a} $ lines contain $ m_{a} $ characters each \u2014 the elements of the first table. Each character is either a \"0\", or a \"1\".\n\nThe next line contains two space-separated integers $ n_{b},m_{b} $ $ (1<=n_{b},m_{b}<=50) $ \u2014 the number of rows and columns in the second table. Then follow the elements of the second table in the format, similar to the first table.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the first table has at least one number \"1\". It is guaranteed that the second table has at least one number \"1\".",
