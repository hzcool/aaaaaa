    "description": "Little Vasya loves orange juice very much. That's why any food and drink in his kitchen necessarily contains orange juice. There are $ n $ drinks in his fridge, the volume fraction of orange juice in the $ i $ -th drink equals $ p_{i} $ percent.\n\nOne day Vasya decided to make himself an orange cocktail. He took equal proportions of each of the $ n $ drinks and mixed them. Then he wondered, how much orange juice the cocktail has.\n\nFind the volume fraction of orange juice in the final drink.",
