    "description": "After returned from forest, Alyona started reading a book. She noticed strings $ s $ and $ t $ , lengths of which are $ n $ and $ m $ respectively. As usual, reading bored Alyona and she decided to pay her attention to strings $ s $ and $ t $ , which she considered very similar.\n\nAlyona has her favourite positive integer $ k $ and because she is too small, $ k $ does not exceed $ 10 $ . The girl wants now to choose $ k $ disjoint non-empty substrings of string $ s $ such that these strings appear as disjoint substrings of string $ t $ and in the same order as they do in string $ s $ . She is also interested in that their length is maximum possible among all variants.\n\nFormally, Alyona wants to find a sequence of $ k $ non-empty strings $ p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},...,p_{k} $ satisfying following conditions:\n\n- $ s $ can be represented as concatenation $ a_{1}p_{1}a_{2}p_{2}...\\ a_{k}p_{k}a_{k+1} $ , where $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{k+1} $ is a sequence of arbitrary strings (some of them may be possibly empty);\n- $ t $ can be represented as concatenation $ b_{1}p_{1}b_{2}p_{2}...\\ b_{k}p_{k}b_{k+1} $ , where $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{k+1} $ is a sequence of arbitrary strings (some of them may be possibly empty);\n- sum of the lengths of strings in sequence is maximum possible.\n\nPlease help Alyona solve this complicated problem and find at least the sum of the lengths of the strings in a desired sequence.\n\nA substring of a string is a subsequence of consecutive characters of the string.",
    "inputFormat": "In the first line of the input three integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=1000 $ , $ 1<=k<=10 $ ) are given \u2014 the length of the string $ s $ , the length of the string $ t $ and Alyona's favourite number respectively.\n\nThe second line of the input contains string $ s $ , consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nThe third line of the input contains string $ t $ , consisting of lowercase English letters.",
    "outputFormat": "In the only line print the only non-negative integer \u2014 the sum of the lengths of the strings in a desired sequence.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that at least one desired sequence exists.",
