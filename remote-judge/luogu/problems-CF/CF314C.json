    "description": "Sereja has a sequence that consists of $ n $ positive integers, $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ .\n\nFirst Sereja took a piece of squared paper and wrote all distinct non-empty non-decreasing subsequences of sequence $ a $ . Then for each sequence written on the squared paper, Sereja wrote on a piece of lines paper all sequences that do not exceed it.\n\nA sequence of positive integers $ x=x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{r} $ doesn't exceed a sequence of positive integers $ y=y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{r} $ , if the following inequation holds: $ x_{1}<=y_{1},x_{2}<=y_{2},...,x_{r}<=y_{r} $ .\n\nNow Sereja wonders, how many sequences are written on the lines piece of paper. Help Sereja, find the required quantity modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .",
