    "description": "There are $ n $ people (numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ ) signed up for a doctor's appointment. The doctor has to choose in which order he will appoint these people. The $ i $ -th patient should be appointed among the first $ p_i $ people. There are also $ m $ restrictions of the following format: the $ i $ -th restriction is denoted by two integers $ (a_i, b_i) $ and means that the patient with the index $ a_i $ should be appointed earlier than the patient with the index $ b_i $ .\n\nFor example, if $ n = 4 $ , $ p = [2, 3, 2, 4] $ , $ m = 1 $ , $ a = [3] $ and $ b = [1] $ , then the only order of appointment of patients that does not violate the restrictions is $ [3, 1, 2, 4] $ . For $ n =3 $ , $ p = [3, 3, 3] $ , $ m = 0 $ , $ a = [] $ and $ b = [] $ , any order of appointment is valid.\n\nFor each patient, calculate the minimum position in the order that they can have among all possible orderings that don't violate the restrictions.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 2000 $ ; $ 0 \\le m \\le 2000 $ ).\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n $ ( $ 1 \\le p_i \\le n $ ).\n\nThen $ m $ lines follow. The $ i $ -th of them contains two integers $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le n $ ; $ a_i \\ne b_i $ ). All pairs of $ (a_i, b_i) $ are distinct (i. e. if $ i \\ne j $ , then either $ a_i \\ne a_j $ , $ b_i \\ne b_j $ , or both).\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: there is at least one valid order of patients.",
    "outputFormat": "Print $ n $ integers, where $ i $ -th integer is equal to the minimum position of $ i $ -th patient in the order, among all valid orders. Positions in the order are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .",
