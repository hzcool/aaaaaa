    "description": "Monocarp is a little boy who lives in Byteland and he loves programming.\n\nRecently, he found a permutation of length $ n $ . He has to come up with a mystic permutation. It has to be a new permutation such that it differs from the old one in each position.\n\nMore formally, if the old permutation is $ p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n $ and the new one is $ q_1,q_2,\\ldots,q_n $ it must hold that $ $$$p_1\\neq q_1, p_2\\neq q_2, \\ldots ,p_n\\neq q_n. $ $$$\n\nMonocarp is afraid of lexicographically large permutations. Can you please help him to find the lexicographically minimal mystic permutation?",
    "inputFormat": "There are several test cases in the input data. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1\\leq t\\leq 200 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. This is followed by the test cases description.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a positive integer $ n $ ( $ 1\\leq n\\leq 1000 $ ) \u2014 the length of the permutation.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ distinct positive integers $ p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n $ ( $ 1 \\leq p_i \\leq n $ ). It's guaranteed that $ p $ is a permutation, i. e. $ p_i \\neq p_j $ for all $ i \\neq j $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ does not exceed $ 1000 $ over all test cases.",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $ n $ positive integers \u2014 the lexicographically minimal mystic permutations. If such a permutation does not exist, output $ -1 $ instead.",
