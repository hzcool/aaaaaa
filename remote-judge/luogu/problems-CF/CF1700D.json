    "description": "Recently in Divanovo, a huge river locks system was built. There are now $ n $ locks, the $ i $ -th of them has the volume of $ v_i $ liters, so that it can contain any amount of water between $ 0 $ and $ v_i $ liters. Each lock has a pipe attached to it. When the pipe is open, $ 1 $ liter of water enters the lock every second.\n\nThe locks system is built in a way to immediately transfer all water exceeding the volume of the lock $ i $ to the lock $ i + 1 $ . If the lock $ i + 1 $ is also full, water will be transferred further. Water exceeding the volume of the last lock pours out to the river.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1700D/400a916b7267c9571228203513add48062776ecc.png)The picture illustrates $ 5 $ locks with two open pipes at locks $ 1 $ and $ 3 $ . Because locks $ 1 $ , $ 3 $ , and $ 4 $ are already filled, effectively the water goes to locks $ 2 $ and $ 5 $ .Note that the volume of the $ i $ -th lock may be greater than the volume of the $ i + 1 $ -th lock.\n\nTo make all locks work, you need to completely fill each one of them. The mayor of Divanovo is interested in $ q $ independent queries. For each query, suppose that initially all locks are empty and all pipes are closed. Then, some pipes are opened simultaneously. For the $ j $ -th query the mayor asks you to calculate the minimum number of pipes to open so that all locks are filled no later than after $ t_j $ seconds.\n\nPlease help the mayor to solve this tricky problem and answer his queries.",

We need to wait $ 4 $ seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\n\nIn the sixth query we can open pipes in locks $ 1 $ , $ 3 $ , and $ 4 $ . After $ 4 $ seconds the locks $ 1 $ and $ 4 $ are full. In the following $ 1 $ second $ 1 $ liter of water is transferred to the locks $ 2 $ and $ 5 $ . The lock $ 3 $ is filled by its own pipe.\n\nSimilarly, in the second query one can open pipes in locks $ 1 $ , $ 3 $ , and $ 4 $ .\n\nIn the fifth query one can open pipes $ 1, 2, 3, 4 $ .",
