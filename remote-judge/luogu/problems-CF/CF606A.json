    "description": "Carl is a beginner magician. He has $ a $ blue, $ b $ violet and $ c $ orange magic spheres. In one move he can transform two spheres of the same color into one sphere of any other color. To make a spell that has never been seen before, he needs at least $ x $ blue, $ y $ violet and $ z $ orange spheres. Can he get them (possible, in multiple actions)?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains three integers $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ ( $ 0<=a,b,c<=1000000 $ ) \u2014 the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that are in the magician's disposal.\n\nThe second line of the input contains three integers, $ x $ , $ y $ and $ z $ ( $ 0<=x,y,z<=1000000 $ ) \u2014 the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that he needs to get.",

After that he will have $ 2 $ blue and $ 5 $ violet spheres. Then he turns $ 4 $ violet spheres into $ 2 $ orange spheres and he ends up with $ 2 $ blue, $ 1 $ violet and $ 2 $ orange spheres, which is exactly what he needs.",
