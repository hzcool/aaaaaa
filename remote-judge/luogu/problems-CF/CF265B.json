    "description": "Squirrel Liss loves nuts. There are $ n $ trees (numbered $ 1 $ to $ n $ from west to east) along a street and there is a delicious nut on the top of each tree. The height of the tree $ i $ is $ h_{i} $ . Liss wants to eat all nuts.\n\nNow Liss is on the root of the tree with the number $ 1 $ . In one second Liss can perform one of the following actions:\n\n- Walk up or down one unit on a tree.\n- Eat a nut on the top of the current tree.\n- Jump to the next tree. In this action the height of Liss doesn't change. More formally, when Liss is at height $ h $ of the tree $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n-1 $ ), she jumps to height $ h $ of the tree $ i+1 $ . This action can't be performed if $ h&gt;h_{i+1} $ .\n\nCompute the minimal time (in seconds) required to eat all nuts.",
