She wants to choose two toys in such a way that their total cost is $ k $ burles. How many ways to do that does she have?\n\nEach toy appears in the shop exactly once. Pairs $ (a, b) $ and $ (b, a) $ are considered equal. Pairs $ (a, b) $ , where $ a=b $ , are not allowed.",

So the answer is 0.\n\nIn the fourth example she can choose the following pairs: $ (1, 1000000000000) $ , $ (2, 999999999999) $ , $ (3, 999999999998) $ , ..., $ (500000000000, 500000000001) $ .
