    "description": "You are given an array of $ n $ positive integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ . In one operation, you can choose any number of the array and add $ 1 $ to it.\n\nMake at most $ 2n $ operations so that the array satisfies the following property: $ a_{i+1} $ is not divisible by $ a_i $ , for each $ i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1 $ .\n\nYou do not need to minimize the number of operations.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1\\le n\\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the length of the given array.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n $ ( $ 1\\le a_i\\leq 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the given array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 5\\cdot 10^4 $ .",

The total number of operations performed is $ 7 $ , which is less than the allowed $ 8 $ operations in this case.\n\nIn the second test case, the array $ [3, 2, 3] $ can be achieved by applying two operations to the first element. Another possible resulting array could be $ [2, 3, 5] $ , because the total number of operations does not need to be minimum.\n\nIn the third test case, not applying any operations results in an array that satisfies the statement's property.
