    "description": "There are $ n $ cities in Berland, arranged in a circle and numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in clockwise order.\n\nYou want to travel all over Berland, starting in some city, visiting all the other cities and returning to the starting city. Unfortunately, you can only drive along the Berland Ring Highway, which connects all $ n $ cities. The road was designed by a very titled and respectable minister, so it is one-directional \u2014 it can only be traversed clockwise, only from the city $ i $ to the city $ (i \\bmod n) + 1 $ (i.e. from $ 1 $ to $ 2 $ , from $ 2 $ in $ 3 $ , ..., from $ n $ to $ 1 $ ).\n\nThe fuel tank of your car holds up to $ k $ liters of fuel. To drive from the $ i $ -th city to the next one, $ a_i $ liters of fuel are needed (and are consumed in the process).\n\nEvery city has a fuel station; a liter of fuel in the $ i $ -th city costs $ b_i $ burles. Refueling between cities is not allowed; if fuel has run out between cities, then your journey is considered incomplete.\n\nFor each city, calculate the minimum cost of the journey if you start and finish it in that city.",
