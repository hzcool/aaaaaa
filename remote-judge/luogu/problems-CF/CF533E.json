    "description": "Analyzing the mistakes people make while typing search queries is a complex and an interesting work. As there is no guaranteed way to determine what the user originally meant by typing some query, we have to use different sorts of heuristics.\n\nPolycarp needed to write a code that could, given two words, check whether they could have been obtained from the same word as a result of typos. Polycarpus suggested that the most common typo is skipping exactly one letter as you type a word.\n\nImplement a program that can, given two distinct words $ S $ and $ T $ of the same length $ n $ determine how many words $ W $ of length $ n+1 $ are there with such property that you can transform $ W $ into both $ S $ , and $ T $ by deleting exactly one character. Words $ S $ and $ T $ consist of lowercase English letters. Word $ W $ also should consist of lowercase English letters.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ ) \u2014 the length of words $ S $ and $ T $ .\n\nThe second line contains word $ S $ .\n\nThe third line contains word $ T $ .\n\nWords $ S $ and $ T $ consist of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that $ S $ and $ T $ are distinct words.",
