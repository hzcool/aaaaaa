    "description": "Life is not easy for the perfectly common variable named Vasya. Wherever it goes, it is either assigned a value, or simply ignored, or is being used!\n\nVasya's life goes in states of a program. In each state, Vasya can either be used (for example, to calculate the value of another variable), or be assigned a value, or ignored. Between some states are directed (oriented) transitions.\n\nA path is a sequence of states $ v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{x} $ , where for any $ 1<=i&lt;x $ exists a transition from $ v_{i} $ to $ v_{i+1} $ .\n\nVasya's value in state $ v $ is interesting to the world, if exists path $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{k} $ such, that $ p_{i}=v $ for some $ i $ $ (1<=i<=k) $ , in state $ p_{1} $ Vasya gets assigned a value, in state $ p_{k} $ Vasya is used and there is no state $ p_{i} $ (except for $ p_{1} $ ) where Vasya gets assigned a value.\n\nHelp Vasya, find the states in which Vasya's value is interesting to the world.",

Between two states can be any number of transitions.",
