    "description": "The grasshopper is located on the numeric axis at the point with coordinate $ x_0 $ .\n\nHaving nothing else to do he starts jumping between integer points on the axis. Making a jump from a point with coordinate $ x $ with a distance $ d $ to the left moves the grasshopper to a point with a coordinate $ x - d $ , while jumping to the right moves him to a point with a coordinate $ x + d $ .\n\nThe grasshopper is very fond of positive integers, so for each integer $ i $ starting with $ 1 $ the following holds: exactly $ i $ minutes after the start he makes a jump with a distance of exactly $ i $ . So, in the first minutes he jumps by $ 1 $ , then by $ 2 $ , and so on.\n\nThe direction of a jump is determined as follows: if the point where the grasshopper was before the jump has an even coordinate, the grasshopper jumps to the left, otherwise he jumps to the right.\n\nFor example, if after $ 18 $ consecutive jumps he arrives at the point with a coordinate $ 7 $ , he will jump by a distance of $ 19 $ to the right, since $ 7 $ is an odd number, and will end up at a point $ 7 + 19 = 26 $ . Since $ 26 $ is an even number, the next jump the grasshopper will make to the left by a distance of $ 20 $ , and it will move him to the point $ 26 - 20 = 6 $ .\n\nFind exactly which point the grasshopper will be at after exactly $ n $ jumps.",
