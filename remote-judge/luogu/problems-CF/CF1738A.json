The $ i $ -th skill is of type $ a_i $ (either fire or frost) and has initial damage $ b_i $ .\n\nThe hero can perform all of the $ n $ skills in any order (with each skill performed exactly once). When performing each skill, the hero can play a magic as follows:\n\n- If the current skill immediately follows another skill of a different type, then its damage is doubled.\n\n In other words, 1. If a skill of type fire and with initial damage $ c $ is performed immediately after a skill of type fire, then it will deal $ c $ damage;\n2. If a skill of type fire and with initial damage $ c $ is performed immediately after a skill of type frost, then it will deal $ 2c $ damage;\n3. If a skill of type frost and with initial damage $ c $ is performed immediately after a skill of type fire, then it will deal $ 2c $ damage;\n4. If a skill of type frost and with initial damage $ c $ is performed immediately after a skill of type frost , then it will deal $ c $ damage.\n\nYour task is to find the maximum damage the hero can deal.",
