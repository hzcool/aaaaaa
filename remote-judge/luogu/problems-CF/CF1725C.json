    "description": "Pak Chanek has a mirror in the shape of a circle. There are $ N $ lamps on the circumference numbered from $ 1 $ to $ N $ in clockwise order. The length of the arc from lamp $ i $ to lamp $ i+1 $ is $ D_i $ for $ 1 \\leq i \\leq N-1 $ . Meanwhile, the length of the arc between lamp $ N $ and lamp $ 1 $ is $ D_N $ .\n\nPak Chanek wants to colour the lamps with $ M $ different colours. Each lamp can be coloured with one of the $ M $ colours. However, there cannot be three different lamps such that the colours of the three lamps are the same and the triangle made by considering the three lamps as vertices is a right triangle (triangle with one of its angles being exactly $ 90 $ degrees).\n\nThe following are examples of lamp colouring configurations on the circular mirror.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1725C/f662b018d5c25548ad3c12ebf7297c4fe9cddb27.png)![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1725C/d15118feff1296e48df6066dea2761fdbf3bbba3.png)![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1725C/904b8c54d18751fcd9444e012c7c141ddaf812b7.png)Figure 1. an example of an incorrect colouring because lamps $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , and $ 3 $ form a right triangleFigure 2. an example of a correct colouringFigure 3. an example of a correct colouringBefore colouring the lamps, Pak Chanek wants to know the number of distinct colouring configurations he can make.
