    "description": "Vlad went into his appartment house entrance, now he is on the $ 1 $ -th floor. He was going to call the elevator to go up to his apartment.\n\nThere are only two elevators in his house. Vlad knows for sure that:\n\n- the first elevator is currently on the floor $ a $ (it is currently motionless),\n- the second elevator is located on floor $ b $ and goes to floor $ c $ ( $ b \\ne c $ ). Please note, if $ b=1 $ , then the elevator is already leaving the floor $ 1 $ and Vlad does not have time to enter it.\n\nIf you call the first elevator, it will immediately start to go to the floor $ 1 $ . If you call the second one, then first it will reach the floor $ c $ and only then it will go to the floor $ 1 $ . It takes $ |x - y| $ seconds for each elevator to move from floor $ x $ to floor $ y $ .\n\nVlad wants to call an elevator that will come to him faster. Help him choose such an elevator.",
