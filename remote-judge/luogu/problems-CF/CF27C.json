    "description": "The sequence is called ordered if it is non-decreasing or non-increasing. For example, sequnces \\[3, 1, 1, 0\\] and \\[1, 2, 3, 100\\] are ordered, but the sequence \\[1, 3, 3, 1\\] is not. You are given a sequence of numbers. You are to find it's shortest subsequence which is not ordered.\n\nA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ). The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers \u2014 the given sequence. All numbers in this sequence do not exceed $ 10^{6} $ by absolute value.",
    "outputFormat": "If the given sequence does not contain any unordered subsequences, output $ 0 $ . Otherwise, output the length $ k $ of the shortest such subsequence. Then output $ k $ integers from the range \\[1.. $ n $ \\] \u2014 indexes of the elements of this subsequence. If there are several solutions, output any of them.",
