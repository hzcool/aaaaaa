    "description": "Gargari is jealous that his friend Caisa won the game from the previous problem. He wants to prove that he is a genius.\n\nHe has a $ n\u00d7n $ chessboard. Each cell of the chessboard has a number written on it. Gargari wants to place two bishops on the chessboard in such a way that there is no cell that is attacked by both of them. Consider a cell with number $ x $ written on it, if this cell is attacked by one of the bishops Gargari will get $ x $ dollars for it. Tell Gargari, how to place bishops on the chessboard to get maximum amount of money.\n\nWe assume a cell is attacked by a bishop, if the cell is located on the same diagonal with the bishop (the cell, where the bishop is, also considered attacked by it).",

On the next line print four integers: $ x_{1},y_{1},x_{2},y_{2} $ $ (1<=x_{1},y_{1},x_{2},y_{2}<=n) $ , where $ x_{i} $ is the number of the row where the $ i $ -th bishop should be placed, $ y_{i} $ is the number of the column where the $ i $ -th bishop should be placed. Consider rows are numbered from 1 to $ n $ from top to bottom, and columns are numbered from 1 to $ n $ from left to right.\n\nIf there are several optimal solutions, you can print any of them.",
