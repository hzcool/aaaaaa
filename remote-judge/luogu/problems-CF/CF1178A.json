    "description": "Alice is the leader of the State Refactoring Party, and she is about to become the prime minister.\n\nThe elections have just taken place. There are $ n $ parties, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The $ i $ -th party has received $ a_i $ seats in the parliament.\n\nAlice's party has number $ 1 $ . In order to become the prime minister, she needs to build a coalition, consisting of her party and possibly some other parties. There are two conditions she needs to fulfil:\n\n- The total number of seats of all parties in the coalition must be a strict majority of all the seats, i.e. it must have strictly more than half of the seats. For example, if the parliament has $ 200 $ (or $ 201 $ ) seats, then the majority is $ 101 $ or more seats.\n- Alice's party must have at least $ 2 $ times more seats than any other party in the coalition. For example, to invite a party with $ 50 $ seats, Alice's party must have at least $ 100 $ seats.\n\nFor example, if $ n=4 $ and $ a=[51, 25, 99, 25] $ (note that Alice'a party has $ 51 $ seats), then the following set $ [a_1=51, a_2=25, a_4=25] $ can create a coalition since both conditions will be satisfied. However, the following sets will not create a coalition:\n\n- $ [a_2=25, a_3=99, a_4=25] $ since Alice's party is not there;\n- $ [a_1=51, a_2=25] $ since coalition should have a strict majority;\n- $ [a_1=51, a_2=25, a_3=99] $ since Alice's party should have at least $ 2 $ times more seats than any other party in the coalition.\n\nAlice does not have to minimise the number of parties in a coalition. If she wants, she can invite as many parties as she wants (as long as the conditions are satisfied). If Alice's party has enough people to create a coalition on her own, she can invite no parties.\n\nNote that Alice can either invite a party as a whole or not at all. It is not possible to invite only some of the deputies (seats) from another party. In other words, if Alice invites a party, she invites all its deputies.\n\nFind and print any suitable coalition.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of parties.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ space separated integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\leq a_i \\leq 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of seats the $ i $ -th party has.",
    "outputFormat": "If no coalition satisfying both conditions is possible, output a single line with an integer $ 0 $ .\n\nOtherwise, suppose there are $ k $ ( $ 1 \\leq k \\leq n $ ) parties in the coalition (Alice does not have to minimise the number of parties in a coalition), and their indices are $ c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_k $ ( $ 1 \\leq c_i \\leq n $ ). Output two lines, first containing the integer $ k $ , and the second the space-separated indices $ c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_k $ .\n\nYou may print the parties in any order. Alice's party (number $ 1 $ ) must be on that list. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.",

    "hint": "In the first example, Alice picks the second party. Note that she can also pick the third party or both of them. However, she cannot become prime minister without any of them, because $ 100 $ is not a strict majority out of $ 200 $ .\n\nIn the second example, there is no way of building a majority, as both other parties are too large to become a coalition partner.\n\nIn the third example, Alice already has the majority.\n\nThe fourth example is described in the problem statement.",
