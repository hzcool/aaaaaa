    "description": "There are $ n $ cities in Treeland connected with $ n - 1 $ bidirectional roads in such that a way that any city is reachable from any other; in other words, the graph of cities and roads is a tree. Treeland is preparing for a seasonal virus epidemic, and currently, they are trying to evaluate different infection scenarios.\n\nIn each scenario, several cities are initially infected with different virus species. Suppose that there are $ k_i $ virus species in the $ i $ -th scenario. Let us denote $ v_j $ the initial city for the virus $ j $ , and $ s_j $ the propagation speed of the virus $ j $ . The spread of the viruses happens in turns: first virus $ 1 $ spreads, followed by virus $ 2 $ , and so on. After virus $ k_i $ spreads, the process starts again from virus $ 1 $ .\n\nA spread turn of virus $ j $ proceeds as follows. For each city $ x $ not infected with any virus at the start of the turn, at the end of the turn it becomes infected with virus $ j $ if and only if there is such a city $ y $ that:\n\n- city $ y $ was infected with virus $ j $ at the start of the turn;\n- the path between cities $ x $ and $ y $ contains at most $ s_j $ edges;\n- all cities on the path between cities $ x $ and $ y $ (excluding $ y $ ) were uninfected with any virus at the start of the turn.\n\nOnce a city is infected with a virus, it stays infected indefinitely and can not be infected with any other virus. The spread stops once all cities are infected.\n\nYou need to process $ q $ independent scenarios. Each scenario is described by $ k_i $ virus species and $ m_i $ important cities. For each important city determine which the virus it will be infected by in the end.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of cities in Treeland.\n\nThe following $ n - 1 $ lines describe the roads. The $ i $ -th of these lines contains two integers $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ ( $ 1 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq n $ ) \u2014 indices of cities connecting by the $ i $ -th road. It is guaranteed that the given graph of cities and roads is a tree.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \\leq q \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of infection scenarios. $ q $ scenario descriptions follow.\n\nThe description of the $ i $ -th scenario starts with a line containing two integers $ k_i $ and $ m_i $ ( $ 1 \\leq k_i, m_i \\leq n $ ) \u2014 the number of virus species and the number of important cities in this scenario respectively. It is guaranteed that $ \\sum_{i = 1}^ q k_i $ and $ \\sum_{i = 1}^ q m_i $ do not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .\n\nThe following $ k_i $ lines describe the virus species.

It is guaranteed that the initial cities of all virus species within a scenario are distinct.\n\nThe following line contains $ m_i $ distinct integers $ u_1, \\ldots, u_{m_i} $ ( $ 1 \\leq u_j \\leq n $ ) \u2014 indices of important cities.",
