    "description": "Consider a tournament with $ n $ participants. The rating of the $ i $ -th participant is $ a_i $ .\n\nThe tournament will be organized as follows. First of all, organizers will assign each participant an index from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . All indices will be unique. Let $ p_i $ be the participant who gets the index $ i $ .\n\nThen, $ n-1 $ games will be held. In the first game, participants $ p_1 $ and $ p_2 $ will play. In the second game, the winner of the first game will play against $ p_3 $ . In the third game, the winner of the second game will play against $ p_4 $ , and so on \u2014 in the last game, the winner of the $ (n-2) $ -th game will play against $ p_n $ .\n\nMonocarp wants to predict the results of all $ n-1 $ games (of course, he will do the prediction only after the indices of the participants are assigned). He knows for sure that, when two participants with ratings $ x $ and $ y $ play, and $ |x - y| > k $ , the participant with the higher rating wins. But if $ |x - y| \\le k $ , any of the two participants may win.\n\nAmong all $ n! $ ways to assign the indices to participants, calculate the number of ways to do this so that Monocarp can predict the results of all $ n-1 $ games. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo $ 998244353 $ .",
