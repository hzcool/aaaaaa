    "description": "The title is a reference to the very first Educational Round from our writers team, Educational Round 18.\n\nThere is a bag, containing colored balls. There are $ n $ different colors of balls, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . There are $ \\mathit{cnt}_i $ balls of color $ i $ in the bag. The total amount of balls in the bag is odd (e. g. $ \\mathit{cnt}_1 + \\mathit{cnt}_2 + \\dots + \\mathit{cnt}_n $ is odd).\n\nIn one move, you can choose two balls with different colors and take them out of the bag.\n\nAt some point, all the remaining balls in the bag will have the same color. That's when you can't make moves anymore.\n\nFind any possible color of the remaining balls.",

Its color can be $ 3, 2 $ or $ 1 $ depending on the move.\n\nIn the second testcase, you can't make moves at all \u2014 there is only color of balls already. This color is $ 1 $ .\n\nIn the third testcase, you can keep removing one ball of color $ 1 $ and one ball of color $ 2 $ until there are no more balls of color $ 1 $ . At the end, three balls of color $ 2 $ remain.",
