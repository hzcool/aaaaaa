    "description": "There are $ n $ players, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ sitting around a round table. The $ (i+1) $ -th player sits to the right of the $ i $ -th player for $ 1 \\le i < n $ , and the $ 1 $ -st player sits to the right of the $ n $ -th player.\n\nThere are $ n^2 $ cards, each of which has an integer between $ 1 $ and $ n $ written on it. For each integer from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , there are exactly $ n $ cards having this number.\n\nInitially, all these cards are distributed among all the players, in such a way that each of them has exactly $ n $ cards. In one operation, each player chooses one of his cards and passes it to the player to his right. All these actions are performed simultaneously.\n\nPlayer $ i $ is called solid if all his cards have the integer $ i $ written on them. Their objective is to reach a configuration in which everyone is solid. Find a way to do it using at most $ (n^2-n) $ operations. You do not need to minimize the number of operations.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2\\le n\\le 100 $ ).\n\nThen $ n $ lines follow. The $ i $ -th of them contains $ n $ integers $ c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n $ ( $ 1\\le c_j\\le n $ ) \u2014 the initial cards of the $ i $ -th player.\n\nIt is guaranteed that for each integer $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , there are exactly $ n $ cards having the number $ i $ .",
    "outputFormat": "In the first line print an integer $ k $ ( $ 0\\le k\\le (n^2-n) $ ) \u2014 the numbers of operations you want to make.\n\nThen $ k $ lines should follow. In the $ i $ -th of them print $ n $ integers $ d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_n $ ( $ 1\\le d_j\\le n $ ) where $ d_j $ is the number written on the card which $ j $ -th player passes to the player to his right in the $ i $ -th operation.\n\nWe can show that an answer always exists under the given constraints.

Then, after making this operation, both players are solid.\n\nIn the second test case, $ 0 $ operations would be enough too. Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.",
