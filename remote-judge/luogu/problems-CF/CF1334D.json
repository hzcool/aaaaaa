    "description": "You are given a complete directed graph $ K_n $ with $ n $ vertices: each pair of vertices $ u \\neq v $ in $ K_n $ have both directed edges $ (u, v) $ and $ (v, u) $ ; there are no self-loops.\n\nYou should find such a cycle in $ K_n $ that visits every directed edge exactly once (allowing for revisiting vertices).\n\nWe can write such cycle as a list of $ n(n - 1) + 1 $ vertices $ v_1, v_2, v_3, \\dots, v_{n(n - 1) - 1}, v_{n(n - 1)}, v_{n(n - 1) + 1} = v_1 $ \u2014 a visiting order, where each $ (v_i, v_{i + 1}) $ occurs exactly once.\n\nFind the lexicographically smallest such cycle. It's not hard to prove that the cycle always exists.\n\nSince the answer can be too large print its $ [l, r] $ segment, in other words, $ v_l, v_{l + 1}, \\dots, v_r $ .",
