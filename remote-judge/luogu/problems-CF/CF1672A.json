    "description": "There are $ n $ logs, the $ i $ -th log has a length of $ a_i $ meters. Since chopping logs is tiring work, errorgorn and maomao90 have decided to play a game.\n\nerrorgorn and maomao90 will take turns chopping the logs with errorgorn chopping first. On his turn, the player will pick a log and chop it into $ 2 $ pieces. If the length of the chosen log is $ x $ , and the lengths of the resulting pieces are $ y $ and $ z $ , then $ y $ and $ z $ have to be positive integers, and $ x=y+z $ must hold. For example, you can chop a log of length $ 3 $ into logs of lengths $ 2 $ and $ 1 $ , but not into logs of lengths $ 3 $ and $ 0 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 2 $ , or $ 1.5 $ and $ 1.5 $ .\n\nThe player who is unable to make a chop will be the loser. Assuming that both errorgorn and maomao90 play optimally, who will be the winner?",

    "hint": "In the first test case, errorgorn will be the winner. An optimal move is to chop the log of length $ 4 $ into $ 2 $ logs of length $ 2 $ . After this there will only be $ 4 $ logs of length $ 2 $ and $ 1 $ log of length $ 1 $ .\n\nAfter this, the only move any player can do is to chop any log of length $ 2 $ into $ 2 $ logs of length $ 1 $ . After $ 4 $ moves, it will be maomao90's turn and he will not be able to make a move. Therefore errorgorn will be the winner.\n\nIn the second test case, errorgorn will not be able to make a move on his first turn and will immediately lose, making maomao90 the winner.",
