    "description": "A coordinate line has $ n $ segments, the $ i $ -th segment starts at the position $ l_{i} $ and ends at the position $ r_{i} $ . We will denote such a segment as $ [l_{i},r_{i}] $ .\n\nYou have suggested that one of the defined segments covers all others. In other words, there is such segment in the given set, which contains all other ones. Now you want to test your assumption. Find in the given set the segment which covers all other segments, and print its number. If such a segment doesn't exist, print -1.\n\nFormally we will assume that segment $ [a,b] $ covers segment $ [c,d] $ , if they meet this condition $ a<=c<=d<=b $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of segments. Next $ n $ lines contain the descriptions of the segments. The $ i $ -th line contains two space-separated integers $ l_{i},r_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the borders of the $ i $ -th segment.\n\nIt is guaranteed that no two segments coincide.",
