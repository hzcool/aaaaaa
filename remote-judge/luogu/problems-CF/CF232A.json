    "description": "John Doe started thinking about graphs. After some thought he decided that he wants to paint an undirected graph, containing exactly $ k $ cycles of length $ 3 $ .\n\nA cycle of length $ 3 $ is an unordered group of three distinct graph vertices $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ , such that each pair of them is connected by a graph edge.\n\nJohn has been painting for long, but he has not been a success. Help him find such graph. Note that the number of vertices there shouldn't exceed $ 100 $ , or else John will have problems painting it.",
    "inputFormat": "A single line contains an integer $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=10^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of cycles of length $ 3 $ in the required graph.",
    "outputFormat": "In the first line print integer $ n $ ( $ 3<=n<=100 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the found graph. In each of next $ n $ lines print $ n $ characters \"0\" and \"1\": the $ i $ -th character of the $ j $ -th line should equal \"0\", if vertices $ i $ and $ j $ do not have an edge between them, otherwise it should equal \"1\". Note that as the required graph is undirected, the $ i $ -th character of the $ j $ -th line must equal the $ j $ -th character of the $ i $ -th line. The graph shouldn't contain self-loops, so the $ i $ -th character of the $ i $ -th line must equal \"0\" for all $ i $ .",
