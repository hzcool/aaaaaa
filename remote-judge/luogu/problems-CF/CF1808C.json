    "description": "In this problem, unlike problem A, you need to look for unluckiest number, not the luckiest one.\n\nNote that the constraints of this problem differ from such in problem A.\n\nOlympus City recently launched the production of personal starships. Now everyone on Mars can buy one and fly to other planets inexpensively.\n\nEach starship has a number \u2014some positive integer $ x $ . Let's define the luckiness of a number $ x $ as the difference between the largest and smallest digits of that number. For example, $ 142857 $ has $ 8 $ as its largest digit and $ 1 $ as its smallest digit, so its luckiness is $ 8-1=7 $ . And the number $ 111 $ has all digits equal to $ 1 $ , so its luckiness is zero.\n\nHateehc is a famous Martian blogger who often flies to different corners of the solar system. To release interesting videos even faster, he decided to buy himself a starship. When he came to the store, he saw starships with numbers from $ l $ to $ r $ inclusively. While in the store, Hateehc wanted to find a starship with the unluckiest number.\n\nSince there are a lot of starships in the store, and Hateehc can't program, you have to help the blogger and write a program that answers his question.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1808C/20c86d6a3ad44baab97e03914b693fecf3deba6f.png)",

The description consists of two integers $ l $ , $ r $ ( $ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le 10^{18} $ ) \u2014 the largest and smallest numbers of the starships in the store.",
