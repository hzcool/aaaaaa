    "description": "Where do odds begin, and where do they end? Where does hope emerge, and will they ever break?\n\nGiven an integer sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ of length $ n $ . Decide whether it is possible to divide it into an odd number of non-empty subsegments, the each of which has an odd length and begins and ends with odd numbers.\n\nA subsegment is a contiguous slice of the whole sequence. For example, $ {3,4,5} $ and $ {1} $ are subsegments of sequence $ {1,2,3,4,5,6} $ , while $ {1,2,4} $ and $ {7} $ are not.",
