    "description": "A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles. The distance between two vertices is the number of edges in a simple path between them.\n\nLimak is a little polar bear. He lives in a tree that consists of $ n $ vertices, numbered $ 1 $ through $ n $ .\n\nLimak recently learned how to jump. He can jump from a vertex to any vertex within distance at most $ k $ .\n\nFor a pair of vertices $ (s,t) $ we define $ f(s,t) $ as the minimum number of jumps Limak needs to get from $ s $ to $ t $ . Your task is to find the sum of $ f(s,t) $ over all pairs of vertices $ (s,t) $ such that $ s&lt;t $ .",

The $ i $ -th of those lines contains two integers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n $ ) \u2014 the indices on vertices connected with $ i $ -th edge.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.",

    "hint": "In the first sample, the given tree has $ 6 $ vertices and it's displayed on the drawing below. Limak can jump to any vertex within distance at most $ 2 $ . For example, from the vertex $ 5 $ he can jump to any of vertices: $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ (well, he can also jump to the vertex $ 5 $ itself).\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF771C/8994ac77b38d70eaef5cd0952cd4c3fda510d514.png)There are ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF771C/cde4e5f0e6e4654d394ac6cfffb62423a3518573.png) pairs of vertices $ (s,t) $ such that $ s&lt;t $ . For $ 5 $ of those pairs Limak would need two jumps: $ (1,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(5,6) $ . For other $ 10 $ pairs one jump is enough. So, the answer is $ 5\u00b72+10\u00b71=20 $ .\n\nIn the third sample, Limak can jump between every two vertices directly. There are $ 3 $ pairs of vertices $ (s&lt;t) $ , so the answer is $ 3\u00b71=3 $ .",
