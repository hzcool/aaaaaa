    "description": "You have a rooted tree consisting of $ n $ vertices. Each vertex of the tree has some color. We will assume that the tree vertices are numbered by integers from 1 to $ n $ . Then we represent the color of vertex $ v $ as $ c_{v} $ . The tree root is a vertex with number 1.\n\nIn this problem you need to answer to $ m $ queries. Each query is described by two integers $ v_{j},k_{j} $ . The answer to query $ v_{j},k_{j} $ is the number of such colors of vertices $ x $ , that the subtree of vertex $ v_{j} $ contains at least $ k_{j} $ vertices of color $ x $ .\n\nYou can find the definition of a rooted tree by the following link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree\\_(graph\\_theory).",
