    "description": "Petya has an array $ a $ consisting of $ n $ integers. He has learned partial sums recently, and now he can calculate the sum of elements on any segment of the array really fast. The segment is a non-empty sequence of elements standing one next to another in the array.\n\nNow he wonders what is the number of segments in his array with the sum less than $ t $ . Help Petya to calculate this number.\n\nMore formally, you are required to calculate the number of pairs $ l, r $ ( $ l \\le r $ ) such that $ a_l + a_{l+1} + \\dots + a_{r-1} + a_r < t $ .",
