    "description": "Vasiliy has a car and he wants to get from home to the post office. The distance which he needs to pass equals to $ d $ kilometers.\n\nVasiliy's car is not new \u2014 it breaks after driven every $ k $ kilometers and Vasiliy needs $ t $ seconds to repair it. After repairing his car Vasiliy can drive again (but after $ k $ kilometers it will break again, and so on). In the beginning of the trip the car is just from repair station.\n\nTo drive one kilometer on car Vasiliy spends $ a $ seconds, to walk one kilometer on foot he needs $ b $ seconds ( $ a&lt;b $ ).\n\nYour task is to find minimal time after which Vasiliy will be able to reach the post office. Consider that in every moment of time Vasiliy can left his car and start to go on foot.",

So the answer equals to 14 seconds.\n\nIn the second example Vasiliy needs to drive the first 2 kilometers on the car (in 2 seconds), then repair his car (in 5 seconds) and drive 2 kilometers more on the car (in 2 seconds). After that he needs to walk on foot 1 kilometer (in 4 seconds). So the answer equals to 13 seconds.",
