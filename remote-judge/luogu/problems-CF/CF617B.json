    "description": "Bob loves everything sweet. His favorite chocolate bar consists of pieces, each piece may contain a nut. Bob wants to break the bar of chocolate into multiple pieces so that each part would contain exactly one nut and any break line goes between two adjacent pieces.\n\nYou are asked to calculate the number of ways he can do it. Two ways to break chocolate are considered distinct if one of them contains a break between some two adjacent pieces and the other one doesn't.\n\nPlease note, that if Bob doesn't make any breaks, all the bar will form one piece and it still has to have exactly one nut.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) \u2014 the number of pieces in the chocolate bar.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=1 $ ), where $ 0 $ represents a piece without the nut and $ 1 $ stands for a piece with the nut.",
