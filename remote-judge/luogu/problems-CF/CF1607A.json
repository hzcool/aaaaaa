    "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of $ 26 $ keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word $ s $ on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions $ 8 $ , $ 5 $ , $ 12 $ and $ 15 $ , respectively. Therefore, it will take $ |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 $ units of time to type the word \"hello\".\n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word $ s $ .",

Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word $ s $ . The word has a length from $ 1 $ to $ 50 $ letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.",
