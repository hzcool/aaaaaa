    "description": "Recently a top secret mission to Mars has taken place. As a result, scientists managed to obtain some information about the Martian DNA. Now we know that any Martian DNA contains at most $ m $ different nucleotides, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ m $ . Special characteristics of the Martian DNA prevent some nucleotide pairs from following consecutively in this chain. For example, if the nucleotide 1 and nucleotide 2 can not follow consecutively in the Martian DNA, then the chain of nucleotides \\[1, 2\\] is not a valid chain of Martian DNA, but the chain of nucleotides \\[2, 1\\] can be a valid chain (if there is no corresponding restriction). The number of nucleotide pairs that can't follow in the DNA chain consecutively, is $ k $ .\n\nThe needs of gene research required information about the quantity of correct $ n $ -long chains of the Martian DNA. Your task is to write a program that will calculate this value.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three space-separated integers $ n,m,k $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{15} $ , $ 1<=m<=52 $ , $ 0<=k<=m^{2} $ ).\n\nNext $ k $ lines contain two characters each, without a space between them, representing a forbidden nucleotide pair. The first character represents the first nucleotide in the forbidden pair, the second character represents the second nucleotide.\n\nThe nucleotides with assigned numbers from 1 to 26 are represented by English alphabet letters from \"a\" to \"z\" (1 is an \"a\", 2 is a \"b\", $ ... $ , 26 is a \"z\"). Nucleotides with assigned numbers from 27 to 52 are represented by English alphabet letters from \"A\" to \"Z\" (27 is an \"A\", 28 is a \"B\", $ ... $ , 52 is a \"Z\").\n\nIt is guaranteed that each forbidden pair occurs at most once in the input. It is guaranteed that nucleotide's numbers in all forbidden pairs cannot be more than $ m $ . Note that order is important in nucleotide pairs.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.",
