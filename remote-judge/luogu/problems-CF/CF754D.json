    "description": "All our characters have hobbies. The same is true for Fedor. He enjoys shopping in the neighboring supermarket.\n\nThe goods in the supermarket have unique integer ids. Also, for every integer there is a product with id equal to this integer. Fedor has $ n $ discount coupons, the $ i $ -th of them can be used with products with ids ranging from $ l_{i} $ to $ r_{i} $ , inclusive. Today Fedor wants to take exactly $ k $ coupons with him.\n\nFedor wants to choose the $ k $ coupons in such a way that the number of such products $ x $ that all coupons can be used with this product $ x $ is as large as possible (for better understanding, see examples). Fedor wants to save his time as well, so he asks you to choose coupons for him. Help Fedor!",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n<=3\u00b710^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of coupons Fedor has, and the number of coupons he wants to choose.\n\nEach of the next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the description of the $ i $ -th coupon. The coupons can be equal.",
    "outputFormat": "In the first line print single integer \u2014 the maximum number of products with which all the chosen coupons can be used. The products with which at least one coupon cannot be used shouldn't be counted.\n\nIn the second line print $ k $ distinct integers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{k} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i}<=n $ ) \u2014 the ids of the coupons which Fedor should choose.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.",

There are $ 31 $ products in total.\n\nIn the second example, no product can be bought with two coupons, that is why the answer is $ 0 $ . Fedor can choose any two coupons in this example.",
