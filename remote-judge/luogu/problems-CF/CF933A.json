    "description": "A dragon symbolizes wisdom, power and wealth. On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.\n\nA performer holding the rod low is represented by a $ 1 $ , while one holding it high is represented by a $ 2 $ . Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ .\n\nLittle Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval $ [l,r] $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ ), then reverse $ a_{l},a_{l+1},...,a_{r} $ so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.\n\nA non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{k} $ , such that $ p_{1}<p_{2}<...<p_{k} $ and $ a_{p1}<=a_{p2}<=...<=a_{pk} $ . The length of the subsequence is $ k $ .",
