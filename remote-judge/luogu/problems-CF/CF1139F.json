    "description": "There are $ m $ people living in a city. There are $ n $ dishes sold in the city. Each dish $ i $ has a price $ p_i $ , a standard $ s_i $ and a beauty $ b_i $ . Each person $ j $ has an income of $ inc_j $ and a preferred beauty $ pref_j $ .\n\nA person would never buy a dish whose standard is less than the person's income. Also, a person can't afford a dish with a price greater than the income of the person. In other words, a person $ j $ can buy a dish $ i $ only if $ p_i \\leq inc_j \\leq s_i $ .\n\nAlso, a person $ j $ can buy a dish $ i $ , only if $ |b_i-pref_j| \\leq (inc_j-p_i) $ . In other words, if the price of the dish is less than the person's income by $ k $ , the person will only allow the absolute difference of at most $ k $ between the beauty of the dish and his/her preferred beauty.\n\nPrint the number of dishes that can be bought by each person in the city.",
