    "description": "While looking at the kitchen fridge, the little boy Tyler noticed magnets with symbols, that can be aligned into a string $ s $ .\n\nTyler likes strings, and especially those that are lexicographically smaller than another string, $ t $ . After playing with magnets on the fridge, he is wondering, how many distinct strings can be composed out of letters of string $ s $ by rearranging them, so that the resulting string is lexicographically smaller than the string $ t $ ? Tyler is too young, so he can't answer this question. The alphabet Tyler uses is very large, so for your convenience he has already replaced the same letters in $ s $ and $ t $ to the same integers, keeping that different letters have been replaced to different integers.\n\nWe call a string $ x $ lexicographically smaller than a string $ y $ if one of the followings conditions is fulfilled:\n\n- There exists such position of symbol $ m $ that is presented in both strings, so that before $ m $ -th symbol the strings are equal, and the $ m $ -th symbol of string $ x $ is smaller than $ m $ -th symbol of string $ y $ .\n- String $ x $ is the prefix of string $ y $ and $ x \\neq y $ .\n\nBecause the answer can be too large, print it modulo $ 998\\,244\\,353 $ .",
