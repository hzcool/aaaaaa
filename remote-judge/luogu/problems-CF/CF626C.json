    "description": "Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. $ n $ of the students use pieces made of two blocks and $ m $ of the students use pieces made of three blocks.\n\nThe students don\u2019t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students\u2019 towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 0<=n,m<=1000000 $ , $ n+m&gt;0 $ ) \u2014 the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.",
