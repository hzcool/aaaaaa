    "description": "This problem is actually a subproblem of problem G from the same contest.\n\nThere are $ n $ candies in a candy box. The type of the $ i $ -th candy is $ a_i $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le n $ ).\n\nYou have to prepare a gift using some of these candies with the following restriction: the numbers of candies of each type presented in a gift should be all distinct (i. e. for example, a gift having two candies of type $ 1 $ and two candies of type $ 2 $ is bad).\n\nIt is possible that multiple types of candies are completely absent from the gift. It is also possible that not all candies of some types will be taken to a gift.\n\nYour task is to find out the maximum possible size of the single gift you can prepare using the candies you have.\n\nYou have to answer $ q $ independent queries.\n\nIf you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of queries. Each query is represented by two lines.\n\nThe first line of each query contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of candies.\n\nThe second line of each query contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le n $ ), where $ a_i $ is the type of the $ i $ -th candy in the box.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all queries does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
