    "description": "Zane once had a good sequence $ a $ consisting of $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ \u2014 but he has lost it.\n\nA sequence is said to be good if and only if all of its integers are non-negative and do not exceed $ 10^{9} $ in value.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF796F/7c34d2981d5a0342e098e7b1d14d4ca5448e48f2.png)However, Zane remembers having played around with his sequence by applying $ m $ operations to it.\n\nThere are two types of operations:\n\n1\\. Find the maximum value of integers with indices $ i $ such that $ l<=i<=r $ , given $ l $ and $ r $ .\n\n2\\. Assign $ d $ as the value of the integer with index $ k $ , given $ k $ and $ d $ .\n\nAfter he finished playing, he restored his sequence to the state it was before any operations were applied. That is, sequence $ a $ was no longer affected by the applied type 2 operations. Then, he lost his sequence at some time between now and then.\n\nFortunately, Zane remembers all the operations and the order he applied them to his sequence, along with the distinct results of all type 1 operations. Moreover, among all good sequences that would produce the same results when the same operations are applied in the same order, he knows that his sequence $ a $ has the greatest cuteness.\n\nWe define cuteness of a sequence as the bitwise OR result of all integers in such sequence. For example, the cuteness of Zane's sequence $ a $ is $ a_{1} $ OR $ a_{2} $ OR ... OR $ a_{n} $ .\n\nZane understands that it might not be possible to recover exactly the lost sequence given his information, so he would be happy to get any good sequence $ b $ consisting of $ n $ integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ that:\n\n1\\. would give the same results when the same operations are applied in the same order, and\n\n2\\. has the same cuteness as that of Zane's original sequence $ a $ .\n\nIf there is such a sequence, find it. Otherwise, it means that Zane must have remembered something incorrectly, which is possible.",
