    "description": "You are given a rooted tree consisting of $ n $ vertices. The vertex $ 1 $ is the root. Each vertex has an integer written on it; this integer is $ val_i $ for the vertex $ i $ .\n\nYou are given $ q $ queries to the tree. The $ i $ -th query is represented by two vertices, $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ . To answer the query, consider all vertices $ w $ that lie in the subtree of $ u_i $ or $ v_i $ (if a vertex is in both subtrees, it is counted twice). For all vertices in these two subtrees, list all integers written on them, and find the integer with the maximum number of occurrences. If there are multiple integers with maximum number of occurrences, the minimum among them is the answer.",
