You are also given a text file labels.txt containing the labels for images with ids 1 through 20, which comprise the learning data set.\n\nYou have to output the classification results for images with ids 21 through 50 in the same format.",
    "inputFormat": "[Download the images and the training labels](http://tc-alchemy.progopedia.com/fourier-doodles.zip)\n\nEach line of the file labels.txt contains a single integer 0 or 1. Line $ i $ (1-based) contains the label of the image {i}.png. Label 1 means that the image depicts a Fourier doodle, label 0 - that it does not.",
