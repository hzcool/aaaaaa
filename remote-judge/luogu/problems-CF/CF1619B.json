    "description": "Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: $ 1 $ , $ 4 $ , $ 8 $ , $ 9 $ , ....\n\nFor a given number $ n $ , count the number of integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such $ x $ that $ x $ is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously).",
