    "description": "Vasya has found a piece of paper with a coordinate system written on it. There are $ n $ distinct squares drawn in this coordinate system. Let's number the squares with integers from 1 to $ n $ . It turned out that points with coordinates $ (0,0) $ and $ (a_{i},a_{i}) $ are the opposite corners of the $ i $ -th square.\n\nVasya wants to find such integer point (with integer coordinates) of the plane, that belongs to exactly $ k $ drawn squares. We'll say that a point belongs to a square, if the point is located either inside the square, or on its boundary.\n\nHelp Vasya find a point that would meet the described limits.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ , $ k $ $ (1<=n,k<=50) $ . The second line contains space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=10^{9}) $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that all given squares are distinct.",
    "outputFormat": "In a single line print two space-separated integers $ x $ and $ y $ $ (0<=x,y<=10^{9}) $ \u2014 the coordinates of the point that belongs to exactly $ k $ squares. If there are multiple answers, you are allowed to print any of them.\n\nIf there is no answer, print \"-1\" (without the quotes).",
