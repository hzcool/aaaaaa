    "description": "You are given two multisets $ A $ and $ B $ . Each multiset has exactly $ n $ integers each between $ 1 $ and $ n $ inclusive. Multisets may contain multiple copies of the same number.\n\nYou would like to find a nonempty subset of $ A $ and a nonempty subset of $ B $ such that the sum of elements in these subsets are equal. Subsets are also multisets, i.e. they can contain elements with equal values.\n\nIf no solution exists, print $ -1 $ . Otherwise, print the indices of elements in any such subsets of $ A $ and $ B $ that have the same sum.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000000 $ ) \u2014 the size of both multisets.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers, denoting the elements of $ A $ . Each element will be between $ 1 $ and $ n $ inclusive.\n\nThe third line contains $ n $ integers, denoting the elements of $ B $ . Each element will be between $ 1 $ and $ n $ inclusive.",
    "outputFormat": "If there is no solution, print a single integer $ -1 $ . Otherwise, your solution should be printed on four lines.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $ k_{a} $ , the size of the corresponding subset of $ A $ . The second line should contain $ k_{a} $ distinct integers, the indices of the subset of $ A $ .\n\nThe third line should contain a single integer $ k_{b} $ , the size of the corresponding subset of $ B $ . The fourth line should contain $ k_{b} $ distinct integers, the indices of the subset of $ B $ .\n\nElements in both sets are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . If there are multiple possible solutions, print any of them.",
