    "description": "Bob is a competitive programmer. He wants to become red, and for that he needs a strict training regime. He went to the annual meeting of grandmasters and asked $ n $ of them how much effort they needed to reach red.\n\n\"Oh, I just spent $ x_i $ hours solving problems\", said the $ i $ -th of them.\n\nBob wants to train his math skills, so for each answer he wrote down the number of minutes ( $ 60 \\cdot x_i $ ), thanked the grandmasters and went home. Bob could write numbers with leading zeroes \u2014 for example, if some grandmaster answered that he had spent $ 2 $ hours, Bob could write $ 000120 $ instead of $ 120 $ .\n\nAlice wanted to tease Bob and so she took the numbers Bob wrote down, and for each of them she did one of the following independently:\n\n- rearranged its digits, or\n- wrote a random number.\n\nThis way, Alice generated $ n $ numbers, denoted $ y_1 $ , ..., $ y_n $ .\n\nFor each of the numbers, help Bob determine whether $ y_i $ can be a permutation of a number divisible by $ 60 $ (possibly with leading zeroes).",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 418 $ ) \u2014 the number of grandmasters Bob asked.\n\nThen $ n $ lines follow, the $ i $ -th of which contains a single integer $ y_i $ \u2014 the number that Alice wrote down.\n\nEach of these numbers has between $ 2 $ and $ 100 $ digits '0' through '9'. They can contain leading zeroes.",
    "outputFormat": "Output $ n $ lines.\n\nFor each $ i $ , output the following. If it is possible to rearrange the digits of $ y_i $ such that the resulting number is divisible by $ 60 $ , output \"red\" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, output \"cyan\".",
