    "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game with $ n $ piles of stones. It is guaranteed that $ n $ is an even number. The $ i $ -th pile has $ a_i $ stones.\n\nAlice and Bob will play a game alternating turns with Alice going first.\n\nOn a player's turn, they must choose exactly $ \\frac{n}{2} $ nonempty piles and independently remove a positive number of stones from each of the chosen piles. They can remove a different number of stones from the piles in a single turn. The first player unable to make a move loses (when there are less than $ \\frac{n}{2} $ nonempty piles).\n\nGiven the starting configuration, determine who will win the game.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 50 $ ) \u2014 the number of piles. It is guaranteed that $ n $ is an even number.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\leq a_i \\leq 50 $ ) \u2014 the number of stones in the piles.",

    "hint": "In the first example, each player can only remove stones from one pile ( $ \\frac{2}{2}=1 $ ). Alice loses, since Bob can copy whatever Alice does on the other pile, so Alice will run out of moves first.\n\nIn the second example, Alice can remove $ 2 $ stones from the first pile and $ 3 $ stones from the third pile on her first move to guarantee a win.",
