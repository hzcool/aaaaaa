    "description": "Vlad found a flowerbed with graphs in his yard and decided to take one for himself. Later he found out that in addition to the usual graphs, $ k $ -flowers also grew on that flowerbed. A graph is called a $ k $ -flower if it consists of a simple cycle of length $ k $ , through each vertex of which passes its own simple cycle of length $ k $ and these cycles do not intersect at the vertices. For example, $ 3 $ -flower looks like this:\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1811F/e34e743f4528bb273ae01a80cb827e1aa6e9fba5.png)Note that $ 1 $ -flower and $ 2 $ -flower do not exist, since at least $ 3 $ vertices are needed to form a cycle.\n\nVlad really liked the structure of the $ k $ -flowers and now he wants to find out if he was lucky to take one of them from the flowerbed.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains the single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nThe descriptions of the cases follow. An empty string is written before each case.\n\nThe first line of each case contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ , $ 1 \\le m \\le \\min(2 \\cdot 10^5, \\frac{n \\cdot (n-1)}{2}) $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively.\n\nThe next $ m $ lines contain two integers each $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1 \\le u, v \\le n $ , $ u \\ne v $ ) \u2014 numbers of vertices connected by an edge. It is guaranteed that the graph does not contain multiple edges and self-loops.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ . It is also guaranteed for the sum of $ m $ over all test cases.",
    "outputFormat": "Output $ t $ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As an answer, output \"YES\" if Vlad's graph is a $ k $ -flower for some $ k $ , and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).",
