The root of the tree is a vertex number $ 1 $ .\n\nA tree is a connected undirected graph with $ n-1 $ edges.\n\nYou are given $ m $ queries. The $ i $ -th query consists of the set of $ k_i $ distinct vertices $ v_i[1], v_i[2], \\dots, v_i[k_i] $ . Your task is to say if there is a path from the root to some vertex $ u $ such that each of the given $ k $ vertices is either belongs to this path or has the distance $ 1 $ to some vertex of this path.",

The $ i $ -th line describes the $ i $ -th query and starts with the integer $ k_i $ ( $ 1 \\le k_i \\le n $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the current query. Then $ k_i $ integers follow: $ v_i[1], v_i[2], \\dots, v_i[k_i] $ ( $ 1 \\le v_i[j] \\le n $ ), where $ v_i[j] $ is the $ j $ -th vertex of the $ i $ -th query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all vertices in a single query are distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ k_i $ does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ( $ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} k_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ).",

The answer is \"YES\" as you can choose the path from the root $ 1 $ to the vertex $ u=10 $ . Then vertices $ [3, 9, 10] $ belong to the path from $ 1 $ to $ 10 $ and the vertex $ 8 $ has distance $ 1 $ to the vertex $ 7 $ which also belongs to this path.\n\nThe second query is $ [2, 4, 6] $ . The answer is \"YES\" as you can choose the path to the vertex $ u=2 $ . Then the vertex $ 4 $ has distance $ 1 $ to the vertex $ 1 $ which belongs to this path and the vertex $ 6 $ has distance $ 1 $ to the vertex $ 2 $ which belongs to this path.\n\nThe third query is $ [2, 1, 5] $ . The answer is \"YES\" as you can choose the path to the vertex $ u=5 $ and all vertices of the query belong to this path.\n\nThe fourth query is $ [4, 8, 2] $ . The answer is \"YES\" as you can choose the path to the vertex $ u=9 $ so vertices $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ both have distance $ 1 $ to the vertex $ 1 $ which belongs to this path and the vertex $ 8 $ has distance $ 1 $ to the vertex $ 7 $ which belongs to this path.\n\nThe fifth and the sixth queries both have answer \"NO\" because you cannot choose suitable vertex $ u $ .",
