    "description": "Recently, Vlad has been carried away by spanning trees, so his friends, without hesitation, gave him a connected weighted undirected graph of $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges for his birthday.\n\nVlad defined the ority of a spanning tree as the [bitwise OR](https://tiny.cc/bitwise_or) of all its weights, and now he is interested in what is the minimum possible ority that can be achieved by choosing a certain spanning tree. A spanning tree is a connected subgraph of a given graph that does not contain cycles.\n\nIn other words, you want to keep $ n-1 $ edges so that the graph remains connected and the bitwise OR weights of the edges are as small as possible. You have to find the minimum bitwise OR itself.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input.\n\nAn empty line is written in front of each test case.\n\nThis is followed by two numbers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, n - 1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices and edges of the graph, respectively.\n\nThe next $ m $ lines contain the description of the edges. Line $ i $ contains three numbers $ v_i $ , $ u_i $ and $ w_i $ ( $ 1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n $ , $ 1 \\le w_i \\le 10^9 $ , $ v_i \\neq u_i $ ) \u2014 the vertices that the edge connects and its weight.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum $ m $ and the sum $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ and each test case contains a connected graph.",
