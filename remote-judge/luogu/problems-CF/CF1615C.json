    "description": "There are $ n $ candles on a Hanukkah menorah, and some of its candles are initially lit. We can describe which candles are lit with a binary string $ s $ , where the $ i $ -th candle is lit if and only if $ s_i=1 $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1615C/23095c0b536d5c6c64ebf4ef5c8e358f51d36118.png)Initially, the candle lights are described by a string $ a $ . In an operation, you select a candle that is currently lit. By doing so, the candle you selected will remain lit, and every other candle will change (if it was lit, it will become unlit and if it was unlit, it will become lit).\n\nYou would like to make the candles look the same as string $ b $ . Your task is to determine if it is possible, and if it is, find the minimum number of operations required.",

Then $ t $ cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1\\le n\\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of candles.\n\nThe second line contains a string $ a $ of length $ n $ consisting of symbols 0 and 1 \u2014 the initial pattern of lights.\n\nThe third line contains a string $ b $ of length $ n $ consisting of symbols 0 and 1 \u2014 the desired pattern of lights.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
