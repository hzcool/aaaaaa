    "description": "The Romans have attacked again. This time they are much more than the Persians but Shapur is ready to defeat them. He says: \"A lion is never afraid of a hundred sheep\".\n\nNevertheless Shapur has to find weaknesses in the Roman army to defeat them. So he gives the army a weakness number.\n\nIn Shapur's opinion the weakness of an army is equal to the number of triplets $ i,j,k $ such that $ i&lt;j&lt;k $ and $ a_{i}&gt;a_{j}&gt;a_{k} $ where $ a_{x} $ is the power of man standing at position $ x $ . The Roman army has one special trait \u2014 powers of all the people in it are distinct.\n\nHelp Shapur find out how weak the Romans are.",
