    "description": "Omkar is creating a mosaic using colored square tiles, which he places in an $ n \\times n $ grid. When the mosaic is complete, each cell in the grid will have either a glaucous or sinoper tile. However, currently he has only placed tiles in some cells.\n\nA completed mosaic will be a mastapeece if and only if each tile is adjacent to exactly $ 2 $ tiles of the same color ( $ 2 $ tiles are adjacent if they share a side.) Omkar wants to fill the rest of the tiles so that the mosaic becomes a mastapeece. Now he is wondering, is the way to do this unique, and if it is, what is it?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 2000 $ ).\n\nThen follow $ n $ lines with $ n $ characters in each line. The $ i $ -th character in the $ j $ -th line corresponds to the cell in row $ i $ and column $ j $ of the grid, and will be $ S $ if Omkar has placed a sinoper tile in this cell, $ G $ if Omkar has placed a glaucous tile, $ . $ if it's empty.",
    "outputFormat": "On the first line, print UNIQUE if there is a unique way to get a mastapeece, NONE if Omkar cannot create any, and MULTIPLE if there is more than one way to do so. All letters must be uppercase.\n\nIf you print UNIQUE, then print $ n $ additional lines with $ n $ characters in each line, such that the $ i $ -th character in the $ j^{\\text{th}} $ line is $ S $ if the tile in row $ i $ and column $ j $ of the mastapeece is sinoper, and $ G $ if it is glaucous.",
