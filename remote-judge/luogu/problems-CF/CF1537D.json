    "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game.\n\nThey start with a positive integer $ n $ and take alternating turns doing operations on it. Each turn a player can subtract from $ n $ one of its divisors that isn't $ 1 $ or $ n $ . The player who cannot make a move on his/her turn loses. Alice always moves first.\n\nNote that they subtract a divisor of the current number in each turn.\n\nYou are asked to find out who will win the game if both players play optimally.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the initial number.",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case output \"Alice\" if Alice will win the game or \"Bob\" if Bob will win, if both players play optimally.",

    "hint": "In the first test case, the game ends immediately because Alice cannot make a move.\n\nIn the second test case, Alice can subtract $ 2 $ making $ n = 2 $ , then Bob cannot make a move so Alice wins.\n\nIn the third test case, Alice can subtract $ 3 $ so that $ n = 9 $ . Bob's only move is to subtract $ 3 $ and make $ n = 6 $ . Now, Alice can subtract $ 3 $ again and $ n = 3 $ . Then Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.",
