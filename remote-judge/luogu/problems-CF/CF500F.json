    "description": "Dohyun is running a grocery store. He sells $ n $ items numbered by integers from 1 to $ n $ . The $ i $ -th ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) of them costs $ c_{i} $ dollars, and if I buy it, my happiness increases by $ h_{i} $ . Each item can be displayed only for $ p $ units of time because of freshness. As Dohyun displays the $ i $ -th item at time $ t_{i} $ , the customers can buy the $ i $ -th item only from time $ t_{i} $ to time $ t_{i}+(p-1) $ inclusively. Also, each customer cannot buy the same item more than once.\n\nI'd like to visit Dohyun's grocery store and buy some items for the New Year Party, and maximize my happiness. Because I am a really busy person, I can visit the store only once, and for very short period of time. In other words, if I visit the store at time $ t $ , I can only buy the items available at time $ t $ . But I can buy as many items as possible, if the budget holds. I can't buy same item several times due to store rules. It is not necessary to use the whole budget.\n\nI made a list of $ q $ pairs of integers $ (a_{j},b_{j}) $ , which means I may visit the store at time $ a_{j} $ , and spend at most $ b_{j} $ dollars at the store. For each pair, I'd like to know the maximum happiness I can obtain. But there are so many pairs that I can't handle them. Can you help me?",

The $ i $ -th ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) of them contains three space-separated integers $ c_{i} $ , $ h_{i} $ , $ t_{i} $ ( $ 1<=c_{i},h_{i}<=4000 $ , $ 1<=t_{i}<=10000 $ ) \u2014 the cost of the $ i $ -th item, the happiness of the $ i $ -th item, and the time when the $ i $ -th item starts to be displayed.\n\nThe next line contains an integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=20000 $ )\u2014 the number of candidates.\n\nNext $ q $ lines describe the candidates.
