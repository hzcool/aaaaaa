    "description": "Recently, on the course of algorithms and data structures, Valeriy learned how to use a deque. He built a deque filled with $ n $ elements. The $ i $ -th element is $ a_i $ ( $ i $ = $ 1, 2, \\ldots, n $ ). He gradually takes the first two leftmost elements from the deque (let's call them $ A $ and $ B $ , respectively), and then does the following: if $ A > B $ , he writes $ A $ to the beginning and writes $ B $ to the end of the deque, otherwise, he writes to the beginning $ B $ , and $ A $ writes to the end of the deque. We call this sequence of actions an operation.\n\nFor example, if deque was $ [2, 3, 4, 5, 1] $ , on the operation he will write $ B=3 $ to the beginning and $ A=2 $ to the end, so he will get $ [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] $ .\n\nThe teacher of the course, seeing Valeriy, who was passionate about his work, approached him and gave him $ q $ queries. Each query consists of the singular number $ m_j $ $ (j = 1, 2, \\ldots, q) $ . It is required for each query to answer which two elements he will pull out on the $ m_j $ -th operation.\n\nNote that the queries are independent and for each query the numbers $ A $ and $ B $ should be printed in the order in which they will be pulled out of the deque.\n\nDeque is a data structure representing a list of elements where insertion of new elements or deletion of existing elements can be made from both sides.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $ , $ 0 \\leq q \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of elements in the deque and the number of queries. The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1 $ , $ a_2 $ , ..., $ a_n $ , where $ a_i $ $ (0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9) $ \u2014 the deque element in $ i $ -th position. The next $ q $ lines contain one number each, meaning $ m_j $ ( $ 1 \\leq m_j \\leq 10^{18} $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "For each teacher's query, output two numbers $ A $ and $ B $ \u2014 the numbers that Valeriy pulls out of the deque for the $ m_j $ -th operation.",
