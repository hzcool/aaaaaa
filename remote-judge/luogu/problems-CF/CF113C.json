    "description": "On the math lesson a teacher asked each pupil to come up with his own lucky numbers. As a fan of number theory Peter chose prime numbers. Bob was more original. He said that number $ t $ is his lucky number, if it can be represented as:\n\n $ t=a^{2}+b^{2}, $  where $ a,b $ are arbitrary positive integers.Now, the boys decided to find out how many days of the interval $ [l,r] $ ( $ l<=r $ ) are suitable for pair programming. They decided that the day $ i $ ( $ l<=i<=r $ ) is suitable for pair programming if and only if the number $ i $ is lucky for Peter and lucky for Bob at the same time. Help the boys to find the number of such days.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains integer numbers $ l,r $ ( $ 1<=l,r<=3\u00b710^{8} $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "In the only line print the number of days on the segment $ [l,r] $ , which are lucky for Peter and Bob at the same time.",
