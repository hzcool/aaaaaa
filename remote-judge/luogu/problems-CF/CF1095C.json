    "description": "A positive integer $ x $ is called a power of two if it can be represented as $ x = 2^y $ , where $ y $ is a non-negative integer. So, the powers of two are $ 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \\dots $ .\n\nYou are given two positive integers $ n $ and $ k $ . Your task is to represent $ n $ as the sum of exactly $ k $ powers of two.",
    "inputFormat": "The only line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 10^9 $ , $ 1 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "If it is impossible to represent $ n $ as the sum of $ k $ powers of two, print NO.\n\nOtherwise, print YES, and then print $ k $ positive integers $ b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_k $ such that each of $ b_i $ is a power of two, and $ \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{k} b_i = n $ . If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.",
