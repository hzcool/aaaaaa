    "description": "There are $ n $ knights sitting at the Round Table at an equal distance from each other. Each of them is either in a good or in a bad mood.\n\nMerlin, the wizard predicted to King Arthur that the next month will turn out to be particularly fortunate if the regular polygon can be found. On all vertices of the polygon knights in a good mood should be located. Otherwise, the next month will bring misfortunes.\n\nA convex polygon is regular if all its sides have same length and all his angles are equal. In this problem we consider only regular polygons with at least 3 vertices, i. e. only nondegenerated.\n\nOn a picture below some examples of such polygons are present. Green points mean knights in a good mood. Red points mean ones in a bad mood.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF71C/05771d25f3570e788948383d5e55e90ca186c9da.png)King Arthur knows the knights' moods.
