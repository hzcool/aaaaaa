    "description": "Ivan has an array consisting of $ n $ elements. Each of the elements is an integer from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .\n\nRecently Ivan learned about permutations and their lexicographical order. Now he wants to change (replace) minimum number of elements in his array in such a way that his array becomes a permutation (i.e. each of the integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ was encountered in his array exactly once). If there are multiple ways to do it he wants to find the lexicographically minimal permutation among them.\n\nThus minimizing the number of changes has the first priority, lexicographical minimizing has the second priority.\n\nIn order to determine which of the two permutations is lexicographically smaller, we compare their first elements. If they are equal \u2014 compare the second, and so on. If we have two permutations $ x $ and $ y $ , then $ x $ is lexicographically smaller if $ x_{i}<y_{i} $ , where $ i $ is the first index in which the permutations $ x $ and $ y $ differ.\n\nDetermine the array Ivan will obtain after performing all the changes.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=200000 $ ) \u2014 the number of elements in Ivan's array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=n $ ) \u2014 the description of Ivan's array.",
    "outputFormat": "In the first line print $ q $ \u2014 the minimum number of elements that need to be changed in Ivan's array in order to make his array a permutation. In the second line, print the lexicographically minimal permutation which can be obtained from array with $ q $ changes.",

Then he will get a permutation \\[1, 2, 4, 3\\] with only two changed numbers \u2014 this permutation is lexicographically minimal among all suitable.\n\nIn the second example Ivan does not need to change anything because his array already is a permutation.",
