We perform $ k $ operations of the following type: choose uniformly at random two indices $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ l<=r $ ) and reverse the order of the elements $ p_{l},p_{l+1},...,p_{r} $ .

    "hint": "Consider the first sample test. We will randomly pick an interval of the permutation $ (1,2,3) $ (which has no inversions) and reverse the order of its elements. With probability ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF513G3/6201067a97da7a97c457211e210f5a8e998bdde9.png), the interval will consist of a single element and the permutation will not be altered.

With the same probability we might pick the interval consisting of the last two elements which will lead to the permutation $ (1,3,2) $ with one inversion. Finally, with probability ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF513G3/f7ba68e3a158029dadd77767404a7d3ca97f69d2.png) the randomly picked interval will contain all elements, leading to the permutation $ (3,2,1) $ with 3 inversions. Hence, the expected number of inversions is equal to ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF513G3/35fd27aec725b8812c04480f588647c66aec3f9c.png).",
