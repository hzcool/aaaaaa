    "description": "Little girl Tanya climbs the stairs inside a multi-storey building. Every time Tanya climbs a stairway, she starts counting steps from $ 1 $ to the number of steps in this stairway. She speaks every number aloud. For example, if she climbs two stairways, the first of which contains $ 3 $ steps, and the second contains $ 4 $ steps, she will pronounce the numbers $ 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4 $ .\n\nYou are given all the numbers pronounced by Tanya. How many stairways did she climb? Also, output the number of steps in each stairway.\n\nThe given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 1000 $ ) \u2014 the total number of numbers pronounced by Tanya.\n\nThe second line contains integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 1000 $ ) \u2014 all the numbers Tanya pronounced while climbing the stairs, in order from the first to the last pronounced number. Passing a stairway with $ x $ steps, she will pronounce the numbers $ 1, 2, \\dots, x $ in that order.\n\nThe given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.",
    "outputFormat": "In the first line, output $ t $ \u2014 the number of stairways that Tanya climbed. In the second line, output $ t $ numbers \u2014 the number of steps in each stairway she climbed. Write the numbers in the correct order of passage of the stairways.",
