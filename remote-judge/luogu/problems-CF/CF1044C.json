    "description": "You are given $ n $ points on the plane. The polygon formed from all the $ n $ points is strictly convex, that is, the polygon is convex, and there are no three collinear points (i.e. lying in the same straight line). The points are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , in clockwise order.\n\nWe define the distance between two points $ p_1 = (x_1, y_1) $ and $ p_2 = (x_2, y_2) $ as their Manhattan distance: $ $$$d(p_1, p_2) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|. $ $ </p><p>Furthermore, we define the perimeter of a polygon, as the sum of Manhattan distances between all adjacent pairs of points on it; if the points on the polygon are ordered as  $ p\\_1, p\\_2, \\\\ldots, p\\_k $   $ (k \\\\geq 3) $ , then the perimeter of the polygon is  $ d(p\\_1, p\\_2) + d(p\\_2, p\\_3) + \\\\ldots + d(p\\_k, p\\_1) $ .</p><p>For some parameter  $ k $ , let's consider all the polygons that can be formed from the given set of points, having <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">any</span>  $ k $  vertices, such that the polygon is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not</span> self-intersecting. For each such polygon, let's consider its perimeter. Over all such perimeters, we define  $ f(k) $  to be the maximal perimeter.</p><p>Please note, when checking whether a polygon is self-intersecting, that the edges of a polygon are still drawn as straight lines. For instance, in the following pictures:</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"/predownloaded/4e/c2/4ec25e6ecb8feac3ac0b9b7fa51a118c2b777e87.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" /> </center><p>In the middle polygon, the order of points ( $ p\\_1, p\\_3, p\\_2, p\\_4 $ ) is not valid, since it is a self-intersecting polygon. The right polygon (whose edges resemble the Manhattan distance) has the same order and is not self-intersecting, but we consider edges as straight lines. The correct way to draw this polygon is ( $ p\\_1, p\\_2, p\\_3, p\\_4 $ ), which is the left polygon.</p><p>Your task is to compute  $ f(3), f(4), \\\\ldots, f(n) $ . In other words, find the maximum possible perimeter for each possible number of points (i.e.  $ 3 $  to  $ n$$$).",
