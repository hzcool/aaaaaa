    "description": "Mr. Funt now lives in a country with a very specific tax laws. The total income of mr. Funt during this year is equal to $ n $ ( $ n>=2 $ ) burles and the amount of tax he has to pay is calculated as the maximum divisor of $ n $ (not equal to $ n $ , of course). For example, if $ n=6 $ then Funt has to pay $ 3 $ burles, while for $ n=25 $ he needs to pay $ 5 $ and if $ n=2 $ he pays only $ 1 $ burle.\n\nAs mr. Funt is a very opportunistic person he wants to cheat a bit. In particular, he wants to split the initial $ n $ in several parts $ n_{1}+n_{2}+...+n_{k}=n $ (here $ k $ is arbitrary, even $ k=1 $ is allowed) and pay the taxes for each part separately. He can't make some part equal to $ 1 $ because it will reveal him. So, the condition $ n_{i}>=2 $ should hold for all $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ k $ .\n\nOstap Bender wonders, how many money Funt has to pay (i.e. minimal) if he chooses and optimal way to split $ n $ in parts.",
