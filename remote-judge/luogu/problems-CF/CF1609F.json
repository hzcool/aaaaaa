He wants you to find out how many segments $ l \\le r $ pass the check. The check is performed in the following manner:\n\n1. The minimum and maximum numbers are found on the segment of the array starting at $ l $ and ending at $ r $ .\n2. The check is considered to be passed if the binary representation of the minimum and maximum numbers have the same number of bits equal to 1.",
