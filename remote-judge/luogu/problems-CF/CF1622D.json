You can perform the following operation with the string $ s $ at most once: choose a substring (a contiguous subsequence) of $ s $ having exactly $ k $ characters 1 in it, and shuffle it (reorder the characters in the substring as you wish).\n\nCalculate the number of different strings which can be obtained from $ s $ by performing this operation at most once.",

Reordering them doesn't change the string at all, so the only string you can obtain is 10010.",
