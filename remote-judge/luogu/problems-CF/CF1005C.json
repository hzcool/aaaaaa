    "description": "A sequence $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ is called good if, for each element $ a_i $ , there exists an element $ a_j $ ( $ i \\ne j $ ) such that $ a_i+a_j $ is a power of two (that is, $ 2^d $ for some non-negative integer $ d $ ).\n\nFor example, the following sequences are good:\n\n- $ [5, 3, 11] $ (for example, for $ a_1=5 $ we can choose $ a_2=3 $ . Note that their sum is a power of two. Similarly, such an element can be found for $ a_2 $ and $ a_3 $ ),\n- $ [1, 1, 1, 1023] $ ,\n- $ [7, 39, 89, 25, 89] $ ,\n- $ [] $ .\n\nNote that, by definition, an empty sequence (with a length of $ 0 $ ) is good.\n\nFor example, the following sequences are not good:\n\n- $ [16] $ (for $ a_1=16 $ , it is impossible to find another element $ a_j $ such that their sum is a power of two),\n- $ [4, 16] $ (for $ a_1=4 $ , it is impossible to find another element $ a_j $ such that their sum is a power of two),\n- $ [1, 3, 2, 8, 8, 8] $ (for $ a_3=2 $ , it is impossible to find another element $ a_j $ such that their sum is a power of two).\n\nYou are given a sequence $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ . What is the minimum number of elements you need to remove to make it good? You can delete an arbitrary set of elements.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains the integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 120000 $ ) \u2014 the length of the given sequence.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "Print the minimum number of elements needed to be removed from the given sequence in order to make it good. It is possible that you need to delete all $ n $ elements, make it empty, and thus get a good sequence.",
