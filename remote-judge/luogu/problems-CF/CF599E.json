    "description": "Rooted tree is a connected graph without any simple cycles with one vertex selected as a root. In this problem the vertex number $ 1 $ will always serve as a root.\n\nLowest common ancestor of two vertices $ u $ and $ v $ is the farthest from the root vertex that lies on both the path from $ u $ to the root and on path from $ v $ to the root. We will denote it as $ LCA(u,v) $ .\n\nSandy had a rooted tree consisting of $ n $ vertices that she used to store her nuts. Unfortunately, the underwater storm broke her tree and she doesn't remember all it's edges. She only managed to restore $ m $ edges of the initial tree and $ q $ triples $ a_{i} $ , $ b_{i} $ and $ c_{i} $ , for which she supposes $ LCA(a_{i},b_{i})=c_{i} $ .\n\nHelp Sandy count the number of trees of size $ n $ with vertex $ 1 $ as a root, that match all the information she remembered. If she made a mess and there are no such trees then print $ 0 $ . Two rooted trees are considered to be distinct if there exists an edge that occur in one of them and doesn't occur in the other one.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ q $ ( $ 1<=n<=13,0<=m<n,0<=q<=100 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices, the number of edges and $ LCA $ triples remembered by Sandy respectively.\n\nEach of the next $ m $ lines contains two integers $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ ( $ 1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n,u_{i}\u2260v_{i} $ ) \u2014 the numbers of vertices connected by the $ i $ -th edge. It's guaranteed that this set of edges is a subset of edges of some tree.\n\nThe last $ q $ lines contain the triplets of numbers $ a_{i} $ , $ b_{i} $ , $ c_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i},c_{i}<=n) $ . Each of these triples define $ LCA(a_{i},b_{i})=c_{i} $ . It's not guaranteed that there exists a tree that satisfy all the given $ LCA $ conditions.",
