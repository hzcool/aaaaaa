    "description": "There are $ n $ people in a row. The height of the $ i $ -th person is $ a_i $ . You can choose any subset of these people and try to arrange them into a balanced circle.\n\nA balanced circle is such an order of people that the difference between heights of any adjacent people is no more than $ 1 $ . For example, let heights of chosen people be $ [a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\dots, a_{i_k}] $ , where $ k $ is the number of people you choose. Then the condition $ |a_{i_j} - a_{i_{j + 1}}| \\le 1 $ should be satisfied for all $ j $ from $ 1 $ to $ k-1 $ and the condition $ |a_{i_1} - a_{i_k}| \\le 1 $ should be also satisfied. $ |x| $ means the absolute value of $ x $ . It is obvious that the circle consisting of one person is balanced.\n\nYour task is to choose the maximum number of people and construct a balanced circle consisting of all chosen people. It is obvious that the circle consisting of one person is balanced so the answer always exists.",
