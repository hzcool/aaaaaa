    "description": "Boris thinks that chess is a tedious game. So he left his tournament early and went to a barber shop as his hair was a bit messy.\n\nHis current hair can be described by an array $ a_1,a_2,\\ldots, a_n $ , where $ a_i $ is the height of the hair standing at position $ i $ . His desired haircut can be described by an array $ b_1,b_2,\\ldots, b_n $ in a similar fashion.\n\nThe barber has $ m $ razors. Each has its own size and can be used at most once. In one operation, he chooses a razor and cuts a segment of Boris's hair. More formally, an operation is:\n\n- Choose any razor which hasn't been used before, let its size be $ x $ ;\n- Choose a segment $ [l,r] $ ( $ 1\\leq l \\leq r \\leq n $ );\n- Set $ a_i := \\min (a_i,x) $ for each $ l\\leq i \\leq r $ ;\n\nNotice that some razors might have equal sizes \u2014 the barber can choose some size $ x $ only as many times as the number of razors with size $ x $ .\n\nHe may perform as many operations as he wants, as long as any razor is used at most once and $ a_i = b_i $ for each $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n $ at the end. He does not have to use all razors.\n\nCan you determine whether the barber can give Boris his desired haircut?",
