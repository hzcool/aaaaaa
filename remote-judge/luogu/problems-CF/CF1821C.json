    "description": "You are given a string $ s $ , consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nIn one operation, you can select several (one or more) positions in it such that no two selected positions are adjacent to each other. Then you remove the letters on the selected positions from the string. The resulting parts are concatenated without changing their order.\n\nWhat is the smallest number of operations required to make all the letters in $ s $ the same?",

You can select positions $ 1, 4, 6 $ first. The string becomes \"bce\". Then select positions $ 1 $ and $ 3 $ . The string becomes \"c\". All letters in it are the same, since it's just one letter.",
