    "description": "Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that positive integers are lucky if their decimal representation doesn't contain digits other than $ 4 $ and $ 7 $ . For example, numbers $ 47 $ , $ 744 $ , $ 4 $ are lucky and $ 5 $ , $ 17 $ , $ 467 $ are not.\n\nLucky number is super lucky if it's decimal representation contains equal amount of digits $ 4 $ and $ 7 $ . For example, numbers $ 47 $ , $ 7744 $ , $ 474477 $ are super lucky and $ 4 $ , $ 744 $ , $ 467 $ are not.\n\nOne day Petya came across a positive integer $ n $ . Help him to find the least super lucky number which is not less than $ n $ .",

    "outputFormat": "Output the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to $ n $ .\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.",
