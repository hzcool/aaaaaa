    "description": "The legend of the foundation of Vectorland talks of two integers $ x $ and $ y $ . Centuries ago, the array king placed two markers at points $ |x| $ and $ |y| $ on the number line and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which he declared to be Arrayland. Many years later, the vector king placed markers at points $ |x - y| $ and $ |x + y| $ and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which he declared to be Vectorland. He did so in such a way that the land of Arrayland was completely inside (including the endpoints) the land of Vectorland.\n\nHere $ |z| $ denotes the absolute value of $ z $ .\n\nNow, Jose is stuck on a question of his history exam: \"What are the values of $ x $ and $ y $ ?\" Jose doesn't know the answer, but he believes he has narrowed the possible answers down to $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ . Now, he wants to know the number of unordered pairs formed by two different elements from these $ n $ integers such that the legend could be true if $ x $ and $ y $ were equal to these two values. Note that it is possible that Jose is wrong, and that no pairs could possibly make the legend true.",
