    "description": "Once upon a time there was only one router in the well-known company Bmail. Years went by and over time new routers were purchased. Every time they bought a new router, they connected it to one of the routers bought before it. You are given the values $ p_i $ \u2014 the index of the router to which the $ i $ -th router was connected after being purchased ( $ p_i < i $ ).\n\nThere are $ n $ routers in Boogle in total now. Print the sequence of routers on the path from the first to the $ n $ -th router.",

The following line contains $ n-1 $ integers $ p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n $ ( $ 1 \\le p_i < i $ ), where $ p_i $ is equal to index of the router to which the $ i $ -th was connected after purchase.",
