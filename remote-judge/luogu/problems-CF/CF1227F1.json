    "description": "Your program fails again. This time it gets \"Wrong answer on test 233\"\n\n\n\n.This is the easier version of the problem. In this version $ 1 \\le n \\le 2000 $ . You can hack this problem only if you solve and lock both problems.\n\nThe problem is about a test containing $ n $ one-choice-questions. Each of the questions contains $ k $ options, and only one of them is correct. The answer to the $ i $ -th question is $ h_{i} $ , and if your answer of the question $ i $ is $ h_{i} $ , you earn $ 1 $ point, otherwise, you earn $ 0 $ points for this question. The values $ h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_n $ are known to you in this problem.\n\nHowever, you have a mistake in your program. It moves the answer clockwise! Consider all the $ n $ answers are written in a circle. Due to the mistake in your program, they are shifted by one cyclically.\n\nFormally, the mistake moves the answer for the question $ i $ to the question $ i \\bmod n + 1 $ . So it moves the answer for the question $ 1 $ to question $ 2 $ , the answer for the question $ 2 $ to the question $ 3 $ , ..., the answer for the question $ n $ to the question $ 1 $ .\n\nWe call all the $ n $ answers together an answer suit. There are $ k^n $ possible answer suits in total.\n\nYou're wondering, how many answer suits satisfy the following condition: after moving clockwise by $ 1 $ , the total number of points of the new answer suit is strictly larger than the number of points of the old one. You need to find the answer modulo $ 998\\,244\\,353 $ .\n\nFor example, if $ n = 5 $ , and your answer suit is $ a=[1,2,3,4,5] $ , it will submitted as $ a'=[5,1,2,3,4] $ because of a mistake. If the correct answer suit is $ h=[5,2,2,3,4] $ , the answer suit $ a $ earns $ 1 $ point and the answer suite $ a' $ earns $ 4 $ points. Since $ 4 > 1 $ , the answer suit $ a=[1,2,3,4,5] $ should be counted.",
