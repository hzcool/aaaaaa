    "description": "One social network developer recently suggested a new algorithm of choosing ads for users.\n\nThere are $ n $ slots which advertisers can buy. It is possible to buy a segment of consecutive slots at once. The more slots you own, the bigger are the chances your ad will be shown to users.\n\nEvery time it is needed to choose ads to show, some segment of slots is picked by a secret algorithm. Then some advertisers are chosen. The only restriction is that it should be guaranteed for advertisers which own at least $ p $ % of slots composing this segment that their ad will be shown.\n\nFrom the other side, users don't like ads. So it was decided to show no more than ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF643G/456b11767914a81261a6157d843e2701d3225d77.png) ads at once. You are asked to develop a system to sell segments of slots and choose ads in accordance with the rules described above.",

Each description is of one of the following forms:\n\n- 1 l r id ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n,1<=id<=150\\ 000 $ ) \u2014 advertiser $ id $ bought all slots in a range from $ l $ to $ r $ inclusive;\n- 2 l r ( $ 1<=l<=r $ ) \u2014 you need to choose advertisers for segment $ [l,r] $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each query of the second type answer should be printed in a separate line. First integer of the answer should be the number of advertisements that will be shown ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF643G/0638c9255fe07c0491debc183669501a3949704b.png).
