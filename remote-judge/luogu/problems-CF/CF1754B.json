    "description": "For his birthday, Kevin received the set of pairwise distinct numbers $ 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n $ as a gift.\n\nHe is going to arrange these numbers in a way such that the minimum absolute difference between two consecutive numbers be maximum possible. More formally, if he arranges numbers in order $ p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n $ , he wants to maximize the value $\\min \\limits_{i=1}^{n - 1} \\lvert p_{i + 1} - p_i \\rvert, $   where  $ |x| $  denotes the absolute value of  $ x$.\n\nHelp Kevin to do that.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\leq 1\\,000 $ ) \u2014 the size of the set.",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case print a single line containing $ n $ distinct integers $ p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n $ ( $ 1 \\le p_i \\le n $ ) describing the arrangement that maximizes the minimum absolute difference of consecutive elements.\n\nFormally, you have to print a permutation $ p $ which maximizes the value $ \\min \\limits_{i=1}^{n - 1} \\lvert p_{i + 1} - p_i \\rvert $ .\n\nIf there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.",

    "hint": "In the first test case the minimum absolute difference of consecutive elements equals $ \\min \\{\\lvert 4 - 2 \\rvert, \\lvert 1 - 4 \\rvert, \\lvert 3 - 1 \\rvert \\} = \\min \\{2, 3, 2\\} = 2 $ . It's easy to prove that this answer is optimal.\n\nIn the second test case each permutation of numbers $ 1, 2, 3 $ is an optimal answer. The minimum absolute difference of consecutive elements equals to $ 1 $ .",
