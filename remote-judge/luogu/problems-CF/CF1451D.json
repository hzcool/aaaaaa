    "description": "Utkarsh is forced to play yet another one of Ashish's games. The game progresses turn by turn and as usual, Ashish moves first.\n\nConsider the 2D plane. There is a token which is initially at  $ (0,0) $ . In one move a player must increase either the $ x $ coordinate or the $ y $ coordinate of the token by exactly $ k $ . In doing so, the player must ensure that the token stays within a (Euclidean) distance $ d $ from $ (0,0) $ .\n\nIn other words, if after a move the coordinates of the token are $ (p,q) $ , then $ p^2 + q^2 \\leq d^2 $ must hold.\n\nThe game ends when a player is unable to make a move. It can be shown that the game will end in a finite number of moves. If both players play optimally, determine who will win.",
