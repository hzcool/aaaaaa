    "description": "A connected undirected graph is called a vertex cactus, if each vertex of this graph belongs to at most one simple cycle.\n\nA simple cycle in a undirected graph is a sequence of distinct vertices $ v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{t} $ $ (t&gt;2) $ , such that for any $ i $ $ (1<=i&lt;t) $ exists an edge between vertices $ v_{i} $ and $ v_{i+1} $ , and also exists an edge between vertices $ v_{1} $ and $ v_{t} $ .\n\nA simple path in a undirected graph is a sequence of not necessarily distinct vertices $ v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{t} $ $ (t&gt;0) $ , such that for any $ i $ $ (1<=i&lt;t) $ exists an edge between vertices $ v_{i} $ and $ v_{i+1} $ and furthermore each edge occurs no more than once. We'll say that a simple path $ v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{t} $ starts at vertex $ v_{1} $ and ends at vertex $ v_{t} $ .\n\nYou've got a graph consisting of $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges, that is a vertex cactus. Also, you've got a list of $ k $ pairs of interesting vertices $ x_{i},y_{i} $ , for which you want to know the following information \u2014 the number of distinct simple paths that start at vertex $ x_{i} $ and end at vertex $ y_{i} $ . We will consider two simple paths distinct if the sets of edges of the paths are distinct.\n\nFor each pair of interesting vertices count the number of distinct simple paths between them. As this number can be rather large, you should calculate it modulo $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ).",
