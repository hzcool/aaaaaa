    "description": "You are given a set of $ n $ vectors on a plane. For each vector you are allowed to multiply any of its coordinates by -1. Thus, each vector $ v_{i}=(x_{i},y_{i}) $ can be transformed into one of the following four vectors:\n\n- $ v_{i}^{1}=(x_{i},y_{i}) $ ,\n- $ v_{i}^{2}=(-x_{i},y_{i}) $ ,\n- $ v_{i}^{3}=(x_{i},-y_{i}) $ ,\n- $ v_{i}^{4}=(-x_{i},-y_{i}) $ .\n\nYou should find two vectors from the set and determine which of their coordinates should be multiplied by -1 so that the absolute value of the sum of the resulting vectors was minimally possible. More formally, you should choose two vectors $ v_{i} $ , $ v_{j} $ ( $ 1<=i,j<=n,i\u2260j $ ) and two numbers $ k_{1} $ , $ k_{2} $ ( $ 1<=k_{1},k_{2}<=4 $ ), so that the value of the expression $ |v_{i}^{k_{1}}+v_{j}^{k_{2}}| $ were minimum.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5} $ ). Then $ n $ lines contain vectors as pairs of integers \" $ x_{i} $ $ y_{i} $ \" ( $ -10000<=x_{i},y_{i}<=10000 $ ), one pair per line.",
    "outputFormat": "Print on the first line four space-separated numbers \" $ i $ $ k_{1} $ $ j $ $ k_{2} $ \" \u2014 the answer to the problem. If there are several variants the absolute value of whose sums is minimum, you can print any of them.",
