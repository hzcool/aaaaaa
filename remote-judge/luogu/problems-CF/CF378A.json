    "description": "Two players are playing a game. First each of them writes an integer from 1 to 6, and then a dice is thrown. The player whose written number got closer to the number on the dice wins. If both payers have the same difference, it's a draw.\n\nThe first player wrote number $ a $ , the second player wrote number $ b $ . How many ways to throw a dice are there, at which the first player wins, or there is a draw, or the second player wins?",

    "outputFormat": "Print three integers: the number of ways to throw the dice at which the first player wins, the game ends with a draw or the second player wins, correspondingly.",
