    "description": "Alice is a beginner composer and now she is ready to create another masterpiece. And not even the single one but two at the same time!\n\nAlice has a sheet with $ n $ notes written on it. She wants to take two such non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that both of them form a melody and sum of their lengths is maximal.\n\nSubsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\nSubsequence forms a melody when each two adjacent notes either differs by 1 or are congruent modulo 7.\n\nYou should write a program which will calculate maximum sum of lengths of such two non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that both of them form a melody.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer number $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=5000 $ ).\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integer numbers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{5} $ ) \u2014 notes written on a sheet.",
    "outputFormat": "Print maximum sum of lengths of such two non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that both of them form a melody.",

    "hint": "In the first example subsequences $ [1,2] $ and $ [4,5] $ give length 4 in total.\n\nIn the second example subsequences $ [62,48,49] $ and $ [60,61] $ give length 5 in total. If you choose subsequence $ [62,61] $ in the first place then the second melody will have maximum length 2, that gives the result of 4, which is not maximal.",
