    "description": "Anton likes to play chess, and so does his friend Danik.\n\nOnce they have played $ n $ games in a row. For each game it's known who was the winner \u2014 Anton or Danik. None of the games ended with a tie.\n\nNow Anton wonders, who won more games, he or Danik? Help him determine this.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ ) \u2014 the number of games played.\n\nThe second line contains a string $ s $ , consisting of $ n $ uppercase English letters 'A' and 'D' \u2014 the outcome of each of the games. The $ i $ -th character of the string is equal to 'A' if the Anton won the $ i $ -th game and 'D' if Danik won the $ i $ -th game.",
    "outputFormat": "If Anton won more games than Danik, print \"Anton\" (without quotes) in the only line of the output.\n\nIf Danik won more games than Anton, print \"Danik\" (without quotes) in the only line of the output.\n\nIf Anton and Danik won the same number of games, print \"Friendship\" (without quotes).",

Hence, the answer is \"Anton\".\n\nIn the second sample, Anton won $ 3 $ games and Danik won $ 4 $ games, so the answer is \"Danik\".\n\nIn the third sample, both Anton and Danik won $ 3 $ games and the answer is \"Friendship\".",
