    "description": "Arkady words in a large company. There are $ n $ employees working in a system of a strict hierarchy. Namely, each employee, with an exception of the CEO, has exactly one immediate manager. The CEO is a manager (through a chain of immediate managers) of all employees.\n\nEach employee has an integer rank. The CEO has rank equal to $ 1 $ , each other employee has rank equal to the rank of his immediate manager plus $ 1 $ .\n\nArkady has a good post in the company, however, he feels that he is nobody in the company's structure, and there are a lot of people who can replace him. He introduced the value of replaceability. Consider an employee $ a $ and an employee $ b $ , the latter being manager of $ a $ (not necessarily immediate). Then the replaceability $ r(a,b) $ of $ a $ with respect to $ b $ is the number of subordinates (not necessarily immediate) of the manager $ b $ , whose rank is not greater than the rank of $ a $ . Apart from replaceability, Arkady introduced the value of negligibility. The negligibility $ z_{a} $ of employee $ a $ equals the sum of his replaceabilities with respect to all his managers, i.e. ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF860E/505bc2ce43f8c1ae79d55147b7d11673e92ab6e4.png), where the sum is taken over all his managers $ b $ .\n\nArkady is interested not only in negligibility of himself, but also in negligibility of all employees in the company. Find the negligibility of each employee for Arkady.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=5\u00b710^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of employees in the company.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ ( $ 0<=p_{i}<=n $ ), where $ p_{i}=0 $ if the $ i $ -th employee is the CEO, otherwise $ p_{i} $ equals the id of the immediate manager of the employee with id $ i $ . The employees are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . It is guaranteed that there is exactly one $ 0 $ among these values, and also that the CEO is a manager (not necessarily immediate) for all the other employees.",

    "hint": "Consider the first example:\n\n- The CEO has no managers, thus $ z_{1}=0 $ .\n- $ r(2,1)=2 $ (employees $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ suit the conditions, employee $ 3 $ has too large rank). Thus $ z_{2}=r(2,1)=2 $ .\n- Similarly, $ z_{4}=r(4,1)=2 $ .\n- $ r(3,2)=1 $ (employee $ 3 $ is a subordinate of $ 2 $ and has suitable rank). $ r(3,1)=3 $ (employees $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 4 $ suit the conditions). Thus $ z_{3}=r(3,2)+r(3,1)=4 $ .",
