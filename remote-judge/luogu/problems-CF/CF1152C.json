    "description": "Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.\n\nNeko has two integers $ a $ and $ b $ . His goal is to find a non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple of $ a+k $ and $ b+k $ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $ k $ , he needs to choose the smallest one.\n\nGiven his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?",
    "inputFormat": "The only line contains two integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9 $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "Print the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ ( $ k \\ge 0 $ ) such that the lowest common multiple of $ a+k $ and $ b+k $ is the smallest possible.\n\nIf there are many possible integers $ k $ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.",
