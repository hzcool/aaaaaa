    "description": "Sho has an array $ a $ consisting of $ n $ integers. An operation consists of choosing two distinct indices $ i $ and $ j $ and removing $ a_i $ and $ a_j $ from the array.\n\nFor example, for the array $ [2, 3, 4, 2, 5] $ , Sho can choose to remove indices $ 1 $ and $ 3 $ . After this operation, the array becomes $ [3, 2, 5] $ . Note that after any operation, the length of the array is reduced by two.\n\nAfter he made some operations, Sho has an array that has only distinct elements. In addition, he made operations such that the resulting array is the longest possible.\n\nMore formally, the array after Sho has made his operations respects these criteria:\n\n- No pairs such that ( $ i < j $ ) and $ a_i = a_j $ exist.\n- The length of $ a $ is maximized.\n\nOutput the length of the final array.",

    "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the length of the final array. Remember that in the final array, all elements are different, and its length is maximum.",

    "hint": "For the first test case Sho can perform operations as follows:\n\n1. Choose indices $ 1 $ and $ 5 $ to remove. The array becomes $ [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3] \\rightarrow [2, 2, 3, 3] $ .\n2. Choose indices $ 1 $ and $ 4 $ to remove. The array becomes $ [2, 2, 3, 3] \\rightarrow [2, 3] $ .\n\n The final array has a length of $ 2 $ , so the answer is $ 2 $ . It can be proven that Sho cannot obtain an array with a longer length.For the second test case Sho can perform operations as follows:\n\n1. Choose indices $ 3 $ and $ 4 $ to remove. The array becomes $ [9, 1, 9, 9, 1] \\rightarrow [9, 1, 1] $ .\n2. Choose indices $ 1 $ and $ 3 $ to remove. The array becomes $ [9, 1, 1] \\rightarrow [1] $ .\n\n The final array has a length of $ 1 $ , so the answer is $ 1 $ . It can be proven that Sho cannot obtain an array with a longer length.",
