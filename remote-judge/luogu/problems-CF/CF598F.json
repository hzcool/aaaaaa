    "description": "Given simple (without self-intersections) $ n $ -gon. It is not necessary convex. Also you are given $ m $ lines. For each line find the length of common part of the line and the $ n $ -gon.\n\nThe boundary of $ n $ -gon belongs to polygon. It is possible that $ n $ -gon contains 180-degree angles.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 3<=n<=1000;1<=m<=100 $ ). The following $ n $ lines contain coordinates of polygon vertices (in clockwise or counterclockwise direction). All vertices are distinct.\n\nThe following $ m $ lines contain line descriptions. Each of them contains two distict points of a line by their coordinates.\n\nAll given in the input coordinates are real numbers, given with at most two digits after decimal point. They do not exceed $ 10^{5} $ by absolute values.",
    "outputFormat": "Print $ m $ lines, the $ i $ -th line should contain the length of common part of the given $ n $ -gon and the $ i $ -th line. The answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .",
