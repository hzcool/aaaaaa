    "description": "There is a strange peculiarity: if you connect the cities of Rostov, Taganrog and Shakhty, peculiarly, you get a triangle\n\n\u00abUnbelievable But True\u00bb\n\n\n\nStudents from many different parts of Russia and abroad come to Summer Informatics School. You marked the hometowns of the SIS participants on a map.\n\nNow you decided to prepare an interesting infographic based on this map. The first thing you chose to do is to find three cities on this map, such that they form a triangle with area $ S $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two integers $ n $ and $ S $ ( $ 3 \\le n \\le 2000 $ , $ 1 \\le S \\le 2 \\cdot 10^{18} $ ) \u2014 the number of cities on the map and the area of the triangle to be found.\n\nThe next $ n $ lines contain descriptions of the cities, one per line. Each city is described by its integer coordinates $ x_i $ , $ y_i $ ( $ -10^9 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^9 $ ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that all cities are located at distinct points. It is also guaranteed that no three cities lie on the same line.",
    "outputFormat": "If the solution doesn't exist \u2014 print \u00abNo\u00bb.\n\nOtherwise, print \u00abYes\u00bb, followed by three pairs of coordinates $ (x, y) $ \u2014 the locations of the three cities, which form the triangle of area $ S $ .",
