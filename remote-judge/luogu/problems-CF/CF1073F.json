And among all such pairs you have to choose one with the maximum total length of these two paths.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the answer with at least two common vertices exists for the given tree.\n\nThe length of the path is the number of edges in it.\n\nThe simple path is the path that visits each vertex at most once.",
