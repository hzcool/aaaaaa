    "description": "There are $ n $ people in a horizontal line, each looking either to the left or the right. Each person counts the number of people in the direction they are looking. The value of the line is the sum of each person's count.\n\nFor example, in the arrangement LRRLL, where L stands for a person looking left and R stands for a person looking right, the counts for each person are $ [0, 3, 2, 3, 4] $ , and the value is $ 0+3+2+3+4=12 $ .\n\nYou are given the initial arrangement of people in the line. For each $ k $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , determine the maximum value of the line if you can change the direction of at most $ k $ people.",
