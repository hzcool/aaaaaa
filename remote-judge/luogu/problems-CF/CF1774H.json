    "description": "Ecrade bought a deck of cards numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Let the value of a permutation $ a $ of length $ n $ be $ \\min\\limits_{i = 1}^{n - k + 1}\\ \\sum\\limits_{j = i}^{i + k - 1}a_j $ .\n\nEcrade wants to find the most valuable one among all permutations of the cards. However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him!",

The description of test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers $ n,k $ ( $ 4 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^5 $ ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^6 $ .",
