On each of $ m $ next days one of the following events took place:\n\n- either employee $ y $ became the boss of employee $ x $ (at that, employee $ x $ didn't have a boss before);\n- or employee $ x $ gets a packet of documents and signs them; then he gives the packet to his boss. The boss signs the documents and gives them to his boss and so on (the last person to sign the documents sends them to the archive);\n- or comes a request of type \"determine whether employee $ x $ signs certain documents\".\n\nYour task is to write a program that will, given the events, answer the queries of the described type. At that, it is guaranteed that throughout the whole working time the company didn't have cyclic dependencies.",

The first number of the line determines the type of event $ t $ $ (1<=t<=3) $ .\n\n- If $ t=1 $ , then next follow two integers $ x $ and $ y $ $ (1<=x,y<=n) $ \u2014 numbers of the company employees. It is guaranteed that employee $ x $ doesn't have the boss currently.\n- If $ t=2 $ , then next follow integer $ x $ $ (1<=x<=n) $ \u2014 the number of the employee who got a document packet.\n- If $ t=3 $ , then next follow two integers $ x $ and $ i $ $ (1<=x<=n;\u00a01<=i<= $ \\[number of packets that have already been given\\] $ ) $ \u2014 the employee and the number of the document packet for which you need to find out information.
