    "description": "The preferred way to generate user login in Polygon is to concatenate a prefix of the user's first name and a prefix of their last name, in that order. Each prefix must be non-empty, and any of the prefixes can be the full name. Typically there are multiple possible logins for each person.\n\nYou are given the first and the last name of a user. Return the alphabetically earliest login they can get (regardless of other potential Polygon users).\n\nAs a reminder, a prefix of a string $ s $ is its substring which occurs at the beginning of $ s $ : \"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\" etc. are prefixes of string \"{abcdef}\" but \"b\" and 'bc\" are not. A string $ a $ is alphabetically earlier than a string $ b $ , if $ a $ is a prefix of $ b $ , or $ a $ and $ b $ coincide up to some position, and then $ a $ has a letter that is alphabetically earlier than the corresponding letter in $ b $ : \"a\" and \"ab\" are alphabetically earlier than \"ac\" but \"b\" and \"ba\" are alphabetically later than \"ac\".",
    "inputFormat": "The input consists of a single line containing two space-separated strings: the first and the last names. Each character of each string is a lowercase English letter. The length of each string is between 1 and 10, inclusive.",
    "outputFormat": "Output a single string \u2014 alphabetically earliest possible login formed from these names. The output should be given in lowercase as well.",
