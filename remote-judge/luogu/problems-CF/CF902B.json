    "description": "You are given a rooted tree with $ n $ vertices. The vertices are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , the root is the vertex number $ 1 $ .\n\nEach vertex has a color, let's denote the color of vertex $ v $ by $ c_{v} $ . Initially $ c_{v}=0 $ .\n\nYou have to color the tree into the given colors using the smallest possible number of steps. On each step you can choose a vertex $ v $ and a color $ x $ , and then color all vectices in the subtree of $ v $ (including $ v $ itself) in color $ x $ . In other words, for every vertex $ u $ , such that the path from root to $ u $ passes through $ v $ , set $ c_{u}=x $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that you have to color each vertex in a color different from $ 0 $ .\n\nYou can learn what a rooted tree is using the link: <a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree\\_(graph\\_theory)</a>.",
