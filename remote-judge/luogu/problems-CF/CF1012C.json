    "description": "Welcome to Innopolis city. Throughout the whole year, Innopolis citizens suffer from everlasting city construction.\n\nFrom the window in your room, you see the sequence of $ n $ hills, where $ i $ -th of them has height $ a_{i} $ . The Innopolis administration wants to build some houses on the hills. However, for the sake of city appearance, a house can be only built on the hill, which is strictly higher than neighbouring hills (if they are present). For example, if the sequence of heights is $ 5,4,6,2 $ , then houses could be built on hills with heights $ 5 $ and $ 6 $ only.\n\nThe Innopolis administration has an excavator, that can decrease the height of an arbitrary hill by one in one hour. The excavator can only work on one hill at a time. It is allowed to decrease hills up to zero height, or even to negative values. Increasing height of any hill is impossible. The city administration wants to build $ k $ houses, so there must be at least $ k $ hills that satisfy the condition above. What is the minimum time required to adjust the hills to achieve the administration's plan?\n\nHowever, the exact value of $ k $ is not yet determined, so could you please calculate answers for all $ k $ in range ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1012C/25df1e0d56b6b6381243603b6cd58a4bf21def8c.png)?

    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains the only integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=5000 $ )\u2014the number of the hills in the sequence.\n\nSecond line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=100000 $ )\u2014the heights of the hills in the sequence.",

The $ i $ -th printed number should be equal to the minimum number of hours required to level hills so it becomes possible to build $ i $ houses.",
