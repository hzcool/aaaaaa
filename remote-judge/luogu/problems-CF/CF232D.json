    "description": "John Doe has a crooked fence, consisting of $ n $ rectangular planks, lined up from the left to the right: the plank that goes $ i $ -th $ (1<=i<=n) $ (from left to right) has width 1 and height $ h_{i} $ . We will assume that the plank that goes $ i $ -th $ (1<=i<=n) $ (from left to right) has index $ i $ .\n\nA piece of the fence from $ l $ to $ r $ $ (1<=l<=r<=n) $ is a sequence of planks of wood with indices from $ l $ to $ r $ inclusive, that is, planks with indices $ l,l+1,...,r $ . The width of the piece of the fence from $ l $ to $ r $ is value $ r-l+1 $ .\n\nTwo pieces of the fence from $ l_{1} $ to $ r_{1} $ and from $ l_{2} $ to $ r_{2} $ are called matching, if the following conditions hold:\n\n- the pieces do not intersect, that is, there isn't a single plank, such that it occurs in both pieces of the fence;\n- the pieces are of the same width;\n- for all $ i $ $ (0<=i<=r_{1}-l_{1}) $ the following condition holds: $ h_{l1+i}+h_{l2+i}=h_{l1}+h_{l2} $ .\n\nJohn chose a few pieces of the fence and now wants to know how many distinct matching pieces are for each of them. Two pieces of the fence are distinct if there is a plank, which belongs to one of them and does not belong to the other one.",

The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ h_{1},h_{2},...,h_{n} $ ( $ 1<=h_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the heights of fence planks.\n\nThe third line contains integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=10^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of queries. Next $ q $ lines contain two space-separated integers $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=n $ ) \u2014 the boundaries of the $ i $ -th piece of the fence.",
