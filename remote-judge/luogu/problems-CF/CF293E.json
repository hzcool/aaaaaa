    "description": "You've got a weighted tree, consisting of $ n $ vertices. Each edge has a non-negative weight. The length of the path between any two vertices of the tree is the number of edges in the path. The weight of the path is the total weight of all edges it contains.\n\nTwo vertices are close if there exists a path of length at most $ l $ between them and a path of weight at most $ w $ between them. Count the number of pairs of vertices $ v,u $ $ (v&lt;u) $ , such that vertices $ v $ and $ u $ are close.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ l $ and $ w $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5},1<=l<=n,0<=w<=10^{9}) $ . The next $ n-1 $ lines contain the descriptions of the tree edges. The $ i $ -th line contains two integers $ p_{i},w_{i} $ $ (1<=p_{i}&lt;(i+1),0<=w_{i}<=10^{4}) $ , that mean that the $ i $ -th edge connects vertex $ (i+1) $ and $ p_{i} $ and has weight $ w_{i} $ .\n\nConsider the tree vertices indexed from 1 to $ n $ in some way.",
