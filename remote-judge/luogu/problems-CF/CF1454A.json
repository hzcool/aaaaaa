    "description": "You are given one integer $ n $ ( $ n > 1 $ ).\n\nRecall that a permutation of length $ n $ is an array consisting of $ n $ distinct integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in arbitrary order. For example, $ [2, 3, 1, 5, 4] $ is a permutation of length $ 5 $ , but $ [1, 2, 2] $ is not a permutation ( $ 2 $ appears twice in the array) and $ [1, 3, 4] $ is also not a permutation ( $ n = 3 $ but there is $ 4 $ in the array).\n\nYour task is to find a permutation $ p $ of length $ n $ that there is no index $ i $ ( $ 1 \\le i \\le n $ ) such that $ p_i = i $ (so, for all $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ the condition $ p_i \\ne i $ should be satisfied).\n\nYou have to answer $ t $ independent test cases.\n\nIf there are several answers, you can print any. It can be proven that the answer exists for each $ n > 1 $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nThe only line of the test case contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the length of the permutation you have to find.",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $ n $ distinct integers $ p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n $ \u2014 a permutation that there is no index $ i $ ( $ 1 \\le i \\le n $ ) such that $ p_i = i $ (so, for all $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ the condition $ p_i \\ne i $ should be satisfied).\n\nIf there are several answers, you can print any.
