    "description": "Lord Omkar would like to have a tree with $ n $ nodes ( $ 3 \\le n \\le 10^5 $ ) and has asked his disciples to construct the tree. However, Lord Omkar has created $ m $ ( $ \\mathbf{1 \\le m < n} $ ) restrictions to ensure that the tree will be as heavenly as possible.\n\nA tree with $ n $ nodes is an connected undirected graph with $ n $ nodes and $ n-1 $ edges. Note that for any two nodes, there is exactly one simple path between them, where a simple path is a path between two nodes that does not contain any node more than once.\n\nHere is an example of a tree:\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1583B/922e28fa3dc9009cfe0a3df0832a3fd2d74db75e.png)A restriction consists of $ 3 $ pairwise distinct integers, $ a $ , $ b $ , and $ c $ ( $ 1 \\le a,b,c \\le n $ ). It signifies that node $ b $ cannot lie on the simple path between node $ a $ and node $ c $ .\n\nCan you help Lord Omkar and become his most trusted disciple? You will need to find heavenly trees for multiple sets of restrictions. It can be shown that a heavenly tree will always exist for any set of restrictions under the given constraints.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4 $ ). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers, $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 3 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $ , $ \\mathbf{1 \\leq m < n} $ ), representing the size of the tree and the number of restrictions.\n\nThe $ i $ -th of the next $ m $ lines contains three integers $ a_i $ , $ b_i $ , $ c_i $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i, b_i, c_i \\le n $ ,  $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ are distinct), signifying that node $ b_i $ cannot lie on the simple path between nodes $ a_i $ and $ c_i $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ across all test cases will not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $ n-1 $ lines representing the $ n-1 $ edges in the tree. On each line, output two integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1 \\le u, v \\le n $ , $ u \\neq v $ ) signifying that there is an edge between nodes $ u $ and $ v $ . Given edges have to form a tree that satisfies Omkar's restrictions.",
