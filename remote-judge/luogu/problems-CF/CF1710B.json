    "description": "You are the owner of a harvesting field which can be modeled as an infinite line, whose positions are identified by integers.\n\nIt will rain for the next $ n $ days. On the $ i $ -th day, the rain will be centered at position $ x_i $ and it will have intensity $ p_i $ . Due to these rains, some rainfall will accumulate; let $ a_j $ be the amount of rainfall accumulated at integer position $ j $ . Initially $ a_j $ is $ 0 $ , and it will increase by $ \\max(0,p_i-|x_i-j|) $ after the $ i $ -th day's rain.\n\nA flood will hit your field if, at any moment, there is a position $ j $ with accumulated rainfall $ a_j>m $ .\n\nYou can use a magical spell to erase exactly one day's rain, i.e., setting $ p_i=0 $ . For each $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , check whether in case of erasing the $ i $ -th day's rain there is no flood.",
