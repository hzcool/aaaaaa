    "description": "Polycarp wants to train before another programming competition. During the first day of his training he should solve exactly $ 1 $ problem, during the second day \u2014 exactly $ 2 $ problems, during the third day \u2014 exactly $ 3 $ problems, and so on. During the $ k $ -th day he should solve $ k $ problems.\n\nPolycarp has a list of $ n $ contests, the $ i $ -th contest consists of $ a_i $ problems. During each day Polycarp has to choose exactly one of the contests he didn't solve yet and solve it. He solves exactly $ k $ problems from this contest. Other problems are discarded from it. If there are no contests consisting of at least $ k $ problems that Polycarp didn't solve yet during the $ k $ -th day, then Polycarp stops his training.\n\nHow many days Polycarp can train if he chooses the contests optimally?",
