    "description": "In a new version of the famous Pinball game, one of the most important parts of the game field is a sequence of $ n $ bumpers. The bumpers are numbered with integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from left to right. There are two types of bumpers. They are denoted by the characters '<' and '>'. When the ball hits the bumper at position $ i $ it goes one position to the right (to the position $ i+1 $ ) if the type of this bumper is '>', or one position to the left (to $ i-1 $ ) if the type of the bumper at position $ i $ is '<'. If there is no such position, in other words if $ i-1&lt;1 $ or $ i+1&gt;n $ , the ball falls from the game field.\n\nDepending on the ball's starting position, the ball may eventually fall from the game field or it may stay there forever. You are given a string representing the bumpers' types. Calculate the number of positions such that the ball will eventually fall from the game field if it starts at that position.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=200000 $ ) \u2014 the length of the sequence of bumpers. The second line contains the string, which consists of the characters '<' and '>'. The character at the $ i $ -th position of this string corresponds to the type of the $ i $ -th bumper.",
    "outputFormat": "Print one integer \u2014 the number of positions in the sequence such that the ball will eventually fall from the game field if it starts at that position.",
