    "description": "Serge came to the school dining room and discovered that there is a big queue here. There are $ m $ pupils in the queue. He's not sure now if he wants to wait until the queue will clear, so he wants to know which dish he will receive if he does. As Serge is very tired, he asks you to compute it instead of him.\n\nInitially there are $ n $ dishes with costs $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ . As you already know, there are the queue of $ m $ pupils who have $ b_1, \\ldots, b_m $ togrogs respectively (pupils are enumerated by queue order, i.e the first pupil in the queue has $ b_1 $ togrogs and the last one has $ b_m $ togrogs)\n\nPupils think that the most expensive dish is the most delicious one, so every pupil just buys the most expensive dish for which he has money (every dish has a single copy, so when a pupil has bought it nobody can buy it later), and if a pupil doesn't have money for any dish, he just leaves the queue (so brutal capitalism...)\n\nBut money isn't a problem at all for Serge, so Serge is buying the most expensive dish if there is at least one remaining.\n\nMoreover, Serge's school has a very unstable economic situation and the costs of some dishes or number of togrogs of some pupils can change. More formally, you must process $ q $ queries:\n\n- change $ a_i $ to $ x $ . It means that the price of the $ i $ -th dish becomes $ x $ togrogs.\n- change $ b_i $ to $ x $ . It means that the $ i $ -th pupil in the queue has $ x $ togrogs now.\n\nNobody leaves the queue during those queries because a saleswoman is late.\n\nAfter every query, you must tell Serge price of the dish which he will buy if he has waited until the queue is clear, or $ -1 $ if there are no dishes at this point, according to rules described above.",

The fourth line conatins integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \\leq q \\leq 300\\ 000 $ ) \u2014 number of queries.\n\nEach of the following $ q $ lines contains as follows:\n\n- if a query changes price of some dish, it contains $ 1 $ , and two integers $ i $ and $ x $ ( $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n $ , $ 1 \\leq x \\leq 10^{6} $ ), what means $ a_i $ becomes $ x $ .\n- if a query changes number of togrogs of some pupil, it contains $ 2 $ , and two integers $ i $ and $ x $ ( $ 1 \\leq i \\leq m $ , $ 1 \\leq x \\leq 10^{6} $ ), what means $ b_i $ becomes $ x $ .",
