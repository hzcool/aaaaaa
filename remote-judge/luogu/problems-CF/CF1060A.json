    "description": "Let's call a string a phone number if it has length 11 and fits the pattern \"8xxxxxxxxxx\", where each \"x\" is replaced by a digit.\n\nFor example, \"80123456789\" and \"80000000000\" are phone numbers, while \"8012345678\" and \"79000000000\" are not.\n\nYou have $ n $ cards with digits, and you want to use them to make as many phone numbers as possible. Each card must be used in at most one phone number, and you don't have to use all cards. The phone numbers do not necessarily have to be distinct.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $ n $ \u2014 the number of cards with digits that you have ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 100 $ ).\n\nThe second line contains a string of $ n $ digits (characters \"0\", \"1\", ..., \"9\") $ s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n $ . The string will not contain any other characters, such as leading or trailing spaces.",
    "outputFormat": "If at least one phone number can be made from these cards, output the maximum number of phone numbers that can be made. Otherwise, output 0.",
