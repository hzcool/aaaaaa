The whole subarray is a almost-increasing, because there are no three consecutive elements such that $ x \\geq y \\geq z $ . So the answer is $ 4 $ .\n\nIn the third query, the subarray is $ a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 = [2, 4, 3, 3] $ . The whole subarray is not almost-increasing, because the last three elements satisfy $ 4 \\geq 3 \\geq 3 $ . An almost-increasing subsequence of length $ 3 $ can be found (for example taking $ a_2,a_3,a_5 = [2,4,3] $ ). So the answer is $ 3 $ .",
