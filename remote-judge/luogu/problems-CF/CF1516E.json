    "description": "This time around, Baby Ehab will play with permutations. He has $ n $ cubes arranged in a row, with numbers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ written on them. He'll make exactly $ j $ operations. In each operation, he'll pick up $ 2 $ cubes and switch their positions.\n\nHe's wondering: how many different sequences of cubes can I have at the end? Since Baby Ehab is a turbulent person, he doesn't know how many operations he'll make, so he wants the answer for every possible $ j $ between $ 1 $ and $ k $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The only line contains $ 2 $ integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 10^9 $ , $ 1 \\le k \\le 200 $ ) \u2014 the number of cubes Baby Ehab has, and the parameter $ k $ from the statement.",
    "outputFormat": "Print $ k $ space-separated integers. The $ i $ -th of them is the number of possible sequences you can end up with if you do exactly $ i $ operations. Since this number can be very large, print the remainder when it's divided by $ 10^9+7 $ .",
