    "description": "Initially, you have the array $ a $ consisting of one element $ 1 $ ( $ a = [1] $ ).\n\nIn one move, you can do one of the following things:\n\n- Increase some (single) element of $ a $ by $ 1 $ (choose some $ i $ from $ 1 $ to the current length of $ a $ and increase $ a_i $ by one);\n- Append the copy of some (single) element of $ a $ to the end of the array (choose some $ i $ from $ 1 $ to the current length of $ a $ and append $ a_i $ to the end of the array).\n\nFor example, consider the sequence of five moves:\n\n1. You take the first element $ a_1 $ , append its copy to the end of the array and get $ a = [1, 1] $ .\n2. You take the first element $ a_1 $ , increase it by $ 1 $ and get $ a = [2, 1] $ .\n3. You take the second element $ a_2 $ , append its copy to the end of the array and get $ a = [2, 1, 1] $ .\n4. You take the first element $ a_1 $ , append its copy to the end of the array and get $ a = [2, 1, 1, 2] $ .\n5. You take the fourth element $ a_4 $ , increase it by $ 1 $ and get $ a = [2, 1, 1, 3] $ .\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain the array with the sum at least $ n $ .\n\nYou have to answer $ t $ independent test cases.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nThe only line of the test case contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the lower bound on the sum of the array.",
