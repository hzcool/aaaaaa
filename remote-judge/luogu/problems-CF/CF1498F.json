    "description": "Alice and Bob are going to celebrate Christmas by playing a game with a tree of presents. The tree has $ n $ nodes (numbered $ 1 $ to $ n $ , with some node $ r $ as its root). There are $ a_i $ presents are hanging from the $ i $ -th node.\n\nBefore beginning the game, a special integer $ k $ is chosen. The game proceeds as follows:\n\n- Alice begins the game, with moves alternating each turn;\n- in any move, the current player may choose some node (for example, $ i $ ) which has depth at least $ k $ . Then, the player picks some positive number of presents hanging from that node, let's call it $ m $ $ (1 \\le m \\le a_i) $ ;\n- the player then places these $ m $ presents on the $ k $ -th ancestor (let's call it $ j $ ) of the $ i $ -th node (the $ k $ -th ancestor of vertex $ i $ is a vertex $ j $ such that $ i $ is a descendant of $ j $ , and the difference between the depth of $ j $ and the depth of $ i $ is exactly $ k $ ). Now, the number of presents of the $ i $ -th node $ (a_i) $ is decreased by $ m $ , and, correspondingly, $ a_j $ is increased by $ m $ ;\n- Alice and Bob both play optimally. The player unable to make a move loses the game.\n\nFor each possible root of the tree, find who among Alice or Bob wins the game.\n\nNote: The depth of a node $ i $ in a tree with root $ r $ is defined as the number of edges on the simple path from node $ r $ to node $ i $ . The depth of root $ r $ itself is zero.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ k $ $ (3 \\le n \\le 10^5, 1 \\le k \\le 20) $ .\n\nThe next $ n-1 $ lines each contain two integers $ x $ and $ y $ $ (1 \\le x, y \\le n, x \\neq y) $ , denoting an undirected edge between the two nodes $ x $ and $ y $ . These edges form a tree of $ n $ nodes.\n\nThe next line contains $ n $ space-separated integers denoting the array $ a $ $ (0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9) $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Output $ n $ integers, where the $ i $ -th integer is $ 1 $ if Alice wins the game when the tree is rooted at node $ i $ , or $ 0 $ otherwise.",

    "hint": "Let us calculate the answer for sample input with root node as 1 and as 2.\n\nRoot node 1\n\nAlice always wins in this case. One possible gameplay between Alice and Bob is:\n\n- Alice moves one present from node 4 to node 3.\n- Bob moves four presents from node 5 to node 2.\n- Alice moves four presents from node 2 to node 1.\n- Bob moves three presents from node 2 to node 1.\n- Alice moves three presents from node 3 to node 1.\n- Bob moves three presents from node 4 to node 3.\n- Alice moves three presents from node 3 to node 1.\n\nBob is now unable to make a move and hence loses.\n\nRoot node 2\n\nBob always wins in this case. One such gameplay is:\n\n- Alice moves four presents from node 4 to node 3.\n- Bob moves four presents from node 5 to node 2.\n- Alice moves six presents from node 3 to node 1.\n- Bob moves six presents from node 1 to node 2.\n\nAlice is now unable to make a move and hence loses.",
