Will you save us?\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF896A/71d5e563ad10c30086a6144a53d77f8376f1107c.png)\n\nNephren is playing a game with little leprechauns.\n\nShe gives them an infinite array of strings, $ f_{0...\\ \u221e} $ .\n\n $ f_{0} $ is \"What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?\".\n\nShe wants to let more people know about it, so she defines $ f_{i}= $ \"What are you doing while sending \" $ f_{i-1} $ \"? Are you busy? Will you send \" $ f_{i-1} $ \"?\" for all $ i>=1 $ .\n\nFor example, $ f_{1} $ is\n\n\"What are you doing while sending \"What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?\"? Are you busy? Will you send \"What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?\"?\". Note that the quotes in the very beginning and in the very end are for clarity and are not a part of $ f_{1} $ .\n\nIt can be seen that the characters in $ f_{i} $ are letters, question marks, (possibly) quotation marks and spaces.\n\nNephren will ask the little leprechauns $ q $ times. Each time she will let them find the $ k $ -th character of $ f_{n} $ . The characters are indexed starting from $ 1 $ . If $ f_{n} $ consists of less than $ k $ characters, output '.' (without quotes).\n\nCan you answer her queries?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=10 $ ) \u2014 the number of Nephren's questions.\n\nEach of the next $ q $ lines describes Nephren's question and contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 0<=n<=10^{5},1<=k<=10^{18} $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "One line containing $ q $ characters. The $ i $ -th character in it should be the answer for the $ i $ -th query.",
