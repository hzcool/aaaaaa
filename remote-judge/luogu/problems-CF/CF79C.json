    "description": "After Fox Ciel got off a bus, she found that the bus she was on was a wrong bus and she lost her way in a strange town. However, she fortunately met her friend Beaver Taro and asked which way to go to her castle. Taro's response to her was a string $ s $ , and she tried to remember the string $ s $ correctly.\n\nHowever, Ciel feels $ n $ strings $ b_{1},b_{2},...\\ ,b_{n} $ are really boring, and unfortunately she dislikes to remember a string that contains a boring substring. To make the thing worse, what she can remember is only the contiguous substring of $ s $ .\n\nDetermine the longest contiguous substring of $ s $ that does not contain any boring string, so that she can remember the longest part of Taro's response.",
    "inputFormat": "In the first line there is a string $ s $ . The length of $ s $ will be between $ 1 $ and $ 10^{5} $ , inclusive.\n\nIn the second line there is a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10 $ ). Next $ n $ lines, there is a string $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ). Each length of $ b_{i} $ will be between $ 1 $ and $ 10 $ , inclusive.\n\nEach character of the given strings will be either a English alphabet (both lowercase and uppercase) or a underscore ('\\_') or a digit. Assume that these strings are case-sensitive.",
    "outputFormat": "Output in the first line two space-separated integers $ len $ and $ pos $ : the length of the longest contiguous substring of $ s $ that does not contain any $ b_{i} $ , and the first position of the substring (0-indexed). The position $ pos $ must be between $ 0 $ and $ |s|-len $ inclusive, where $ |s| $ is the length of string $ s $ .\n\nIf there are several solutions, output any.",
