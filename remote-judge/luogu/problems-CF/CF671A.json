    "description": "It was recycling day in Kekoland. To celebrate it Adil and Bera went to Central Perk where they can take bottles from the ground and put them into a recycling bin.\n\nWe can think Central Perk as coordinate plane. There are $ n $ bottles on the ground, the $ i $ -th bottle is located at position $ (x_{i},y_{i}) $ . Both Adil and Bera can carry only one bottle at once each.\n\nFor both Adil and Bera the process looks as follows:\n\n1. Choose to stop or to continue to collect bottles.\n2. If the choice was to continue then choose some bottle and walk towards it.\n3. Pick this bottle and walk to the recycling bin.\n4. Go to step $ 1 $ .\n\nAdil and Bera may move independently. They are allowed to pick bottles simultaneously, all bottles may be picked by any of the two, it's allowed that one of them stays still while the other one continues to pick bottles.\n\nThey want to organize the process such that the total distance they walk (the sum of distance walked by Adil and distance walked by Bera) is minimum possible. Of course, at the end all bottles should lie in the recycling bin.",
    "inputFormat": "First line of the input contains six integers $ a_{x} $ , $ a_{y} $ , $ b_{x} $ , $ b_{y} $ , $ t_{x} $ and $ t_{y} $ ( $ 0<=a_{x},a_{y},b_{x},b_{y},t_{x},t_{y}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 initial positions of Adil, Bera and recycling bin respectively.\n\nThe second line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ ) \u2014 the number of bottles on the ground.\n\nThen follow $ n $ lines, each of them contains two integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ 0<=x_{i},y_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 position of the $ i $ -th bottle.\n\nIt's guaranteed that positions of Adil, Bera, recycling bin and all bottles are distinct.",
