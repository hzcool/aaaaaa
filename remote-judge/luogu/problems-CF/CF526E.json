    "description": "Optimizing the amount of data transmitted via a network is an important and interesting part of developing any network application.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF526E/a78fce818bfb1b716eb4c13dcdfd873c3aac4f4e.png)In one secret game developed deep in the ZeptoLab company, the game universe consists of $ n $ levels, located in a circle. You can get from level $ i $ to levels $ i-1 $ and $ i+1 $ , also you can get from level $ 1 $ to level $ n $ and vice versa. The map of the $ i $ -th level description size is $ a_{i} $ bytes.\n\nIn order to reduce the transmitted traffic, the game gets levels as follows. All the levels on the server are divided into $ m $ groups and each time a player finds himself on one of the levels of a certain group for the first time, the server sends all levels of the group to the game client as a single packet. Thus, when a player travels inside the levels of a single group, the application doesn't need any new information. Due to the technical limitations the packet can contain an arbitrary number of levels but their total size mustn't exceed $ b $ bytes, where $ b $ is some positive integer constant.\n\nUsual situation is that players finish levels one by one, that's why a decision was made to split $ n $ levels into $ m $ groups so that each group was a continuous segment containing multiple neighboring levels (also, the group can have two adjacent levels, $ n $ and $ 1 $ ). Specifically, if the descriptions of all levels have the total weight of at most $ b $ bytes, then they can all be united into one group to be sent in a single packet.\n\nDetermine, what minimum number of groups do you need to make in order to organize the levels of the game observing the conditions above?\n\nAs developing a game is a long process and technology never stagnates, it is yet impossible to predict exactly what value will take constant value $ b $ limiting the packet size when the game is out. That's why the developers ask you to find the answer for multiple values of $ b $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ , $ q $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{6} $ , $ 1<=q<=50 $ ) \u2014 the number of levels in the game universe and the number of distinct values of $ b $ that you need to process.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the sizes of the levels in bytes.\n\nThe next $ q $ lines contain integers $ b_{j} $ (![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF526E/34c586a241ddd21160ec70554bfe77fed04061b1.png)), determining the values of constant $ b $ , for which you need to determine the answer.",
