    "description": "Innokentiy likes tea very much and today he wants to drink exactly $ n $ cups of tea. He would be happy to drink more but he had exactly $ n $ tea bags, $ a $ of them are green and $ b $ are black.\n\nInnokentiy doesn't like to drink the same tea (green or black) more than $ k $ times in a row. Your task is to determine the order of brewing tea bags so that Innokentiy will be able to drink $ n $ cups of tea, without drinking the same tea more than $ k $ times in a row, or to inform that it is impossible. Each tea bag has to be used exactly once.",

If some character equals 'B', then the corresponding cup of tea should be black.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
