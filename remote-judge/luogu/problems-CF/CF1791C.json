    "description": "Timur initially had a binary string $ ^{\\dagger} $ $ s $ (possibly of length $ 0 $ ). He performed the following operation several (possibly zero) times:\n\n- Add $ \\texttt{0} $ to one end of the string and $ \\texttt{1} $ to the other end of the string. For example, starting from the string $ \\texttt{1011} $ , you can obtain either $ \\color{red}{\\texttt{0}}\\texttt{1011}\\color{red}{\\texttt{1}} $ or $ \\color{red}{\\texttt{1}}\\texttt{1011}\\color{red}{\\texttt{0}} $ .\n\n You are given Timur's final string. What is the length of the shortest possible string he could have started with? $ ^{\\dagger} $ A binary string is a string (possibly the empty string) whose characters are either $ \\texttt{0} $ or $ \\texttt{1} $ .",
