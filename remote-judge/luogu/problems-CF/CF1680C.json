The string may become empty after the removals. The cost of the removal is the maximum of the following two values:\n\n- the number of characters 0 left in the string;\n- the number of characters 1 removed from the string.\n\nWhat is the minimum cost of removal you can achieve?",

Two characters 0 remain, three characters 1 are deleted, so the cost is $ 3 $ ;\n3. in the third test case, it's optimal to remove four characters from the beginning;\n4. in the fourth test case, it's optimal to remove the whole string;\n5. in the fifth test case, it's optimal to leave the string as it is.",
