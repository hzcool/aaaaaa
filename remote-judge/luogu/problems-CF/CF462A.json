Each cell of the board has either character 'x', or character 'o'. Is it true that each cell of the board has even number of adjacent cells with 'o'? Two cells of the board are adjacent if they share a side.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ). Then $ n $ lines follow containing the description of the checkerboard. Each of them contains $ n $ characters (either 'x' or 'o') without spaces.",
