    "description": "An atom of element X can exist in $ n $ distinct states with energies $ E_{1}<E_{2}<...<E_{n} $ . Arkady wants to build a laser on this element, using a three-level scheme. Here is a simplified description of the scheme.\n\nThree distinct states $ i $ , $ j $ and $ k $ are selected, where $ i<j<k $ . After that the following process happens:\n\n1. initially the atom is in the state $ i $ ,\n2. we spend $ E_{k}-E_{i} $ energy to put the atom in the state $ k $ ,\n3. the atom emits a photon with useful energy $ E_{k}-E_{j} $ and changes its state to the state $ j $ ,\n4. the atom spontaneously changes its state to the state $ i $ , losing energy $ E_{j}-E_{i} $ ,\n5. the process repeats from step 1.\n\nLet's define the energy conversion efficiency as ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF924B/dd021747dbc78de91e905a31390ad0cfead20383.png), i. e. the ration between the useful energy of the photon and spent energy.\n\nDue to some limitations, Arkady can only choose such three states that $ E_{k}-E_{i}<=U $ .\n\nHelp Arkady to find such the maximum possible energy conversion efficiency within the above constraints.",

It is guaranteed that all $ E_{i} $ are given in increasing order.",
