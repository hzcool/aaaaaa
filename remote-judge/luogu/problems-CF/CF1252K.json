    "description": "Adding two numbers several times is a time-consuming task, so you want to build a robot. The robot should have a string $ S = S_1 S_2 \\dots S_N $ of $ N $ characters on its memory that represents addition instructions. Each character of the string, $ S_i $ , is either 'A' or 'B'.\n\nYou want to be able to give $ Q $ commands to the robot, each command is either of the following types:\n\n- 1 $ L $ $ R $ . The robot should toggle all the characters of $ S_i $ where $ L \\le i \\le R $ . Toggling a character means changing it to 'A' if it was previously 'B', or changing it to 'B' if it was previously 'A'.\n- 2 $ L $ $ R $ $ A $ $ B $ . The robot should call $ f(L, R, A, B) $ and return two integers as defined in the following pseudocode: ```\n  <pre class=\"lstlisting\">```\n      function f(L, R, A, B):<br></br>      FOR i from L to R<br></br>        if S[i] = 'A'<br></br>          A = A + B<br></br>        else<br></br>          B = A + B<br></br>      return (A, B)<br></br>\n  ```\n  ```\n\nYou want to implement the robot's expected behavior.",
    "inputFormat": "Input begins with a line containing two integers: $ N $ $ Q $ ( $ 1 \\le N, Q \\le 100\\,000 $ ) representing the number of characters in the robot's memory and the number of commands, respectively. The next line contains a string $ S $ containing $ N $ characters (each either 'A' or 'B') representing the initial string in the robot's memory. The next $ Q $ lines each contains a command of the following types.\n\n- 1 $ L $ $ R $ ( $ 1 \\le L \\le R \\le N $ )\n- 2 $ L $ $ R $ $ A $ $ B $ ( $ 1 \\le L \\le R \\le N $ ; $ 0 \\le A, B \\le 10^9 $ )\n\n There is at least one command of the second type.",
    "outputFormat": "For each command of the second type in the same order as input, output in a line two integers (separated by a single space), the value of $ A $ and $ B $ returned by $ f(L, R, A, B) $ , respectively. As this output can be large, you need to modulo the output by $ 1\\,000\\,000\\,007 $ .",

    "hint": "Explanation for the sample input/output #1\n\nFor the first command, calling $ f(L, R, A, B) $ causes the following:\n\n- Initially, $ A = 1 $ and $ B = 1 $ .\n- At the end of $ i = 1 $ , $ A = 2 $ and $ B = 1 $ .\n- At the end of $ i = 2 $ , $ A = 2 $ and $ B = 3 $ .\n- At the end of $ i = 3 $ , $ A = 5 $ and $ B = 3 $ .\n- At the end of $ i = 4 $ , $ A = 8 $ and $ B = 3 $ .\n- At the end of $ i = 5 $ , $ A = 11 $ and $ B = 3 $ .\n\n Therefore, $ f(L, R, A, B) $ will return $ (11, 3) $ .For the second command, string $ S $ will be updated to \"ABBBB\".\n\nFor the third command, the value of $ A $ will always be $ 0 $ and the value of $ B $ will always be $ 1\\,000\\,000\\,000 $ . Therefore, $ f(L, R, A, B) $ will return $ (0, 1\\,000\\,000\\,000) $ .",
