    "description": "The Hexadecimal virus loves playing with number sets \u2014 intersecting them, uniting them. One beautiful day she was surprised to find out that Scuzzy, her spherical pet cat, united all sets in one and ate the result! Something had to be done quickly and Hexadecimal rushed to the market.\n\nThe market has $ n $ sets of numbers on sale. The virus wants to buy the following collection of sets: the number of sets in the collection should be exactly the same as the number of numbers in the union of all bought sets. Moreover, Hexadecimal wants to buy the cheapest suitable collection of set.\n\nYet nothing's so easy! As Mainframe is a kingdom of pure rivalry markets, we know that the union of any $ k $ sets contains no less than $ k $ distinct numbers (for every positive integer $ k $ ).\n\nHelp the virus choose the suitable collection of sets. The collection can be empty.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains the only number $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=300 $ ) \u2014 the number of sets available in the market.\n\nNext $ n $ lines describe the goods: first we are given $ m_{i} $ ( $ 1<=m_{i}<=n $ ) \u2014 the number of distinct numbers in the $ i $ -th set, then follow $ m_{i} $ numbers \u2014 the set's elements. We know that the set's elements are distinct positive integers and they do not exceed $ n $ .\n\nThe last line contains $ n $ integers whose absolute values do not exceed $ 10^{6} $ \u2014 the price of each set.",
