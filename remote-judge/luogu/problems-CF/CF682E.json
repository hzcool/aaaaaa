    "description": "You are given $ n $ points with integer coordinates on the plane. Points are given in a way such that there is no triangle, formed by any three of these $ n $ points, which area exceeds $ S $ .\n\nAlyona tried to construct a triangle with integer coordinates, which contains all $ n $ points and which area doesn't exceed $ 4S $ , but, by obvious reason, had no success in that. Please help Alyona construct such triangle. Please note that vertices of resulting triangle are not necessarily chosen from $ n $ given points.",
    "inputFormat": "In the first line of the input two integers $ n $ and $ S $ ( $ 3<=n<=5000 $ , $ 1<=S<=10^{18} $ ) are given \u2014 the number of points given and the upper bound value of any triangle's area, formed by any three of given $ n $ points.\n\nThe next $ n $ lines describes given points: $ i^{th} $ of them consists of two integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ $ (-10^{8}<=x_{i},y_{i}<=10^{8}) $ \u2014 coordinates of $ i^{th} $ point.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one triple of points not lying on the same line.",
    "outputFormat": "Print the coordinates of three points \u2014 vertices of a triangle which contains all $ n $ points and which area doesn't exceed $ 4S $ .\n\nCoordinates of every triangle's vertex should be printed on a separate line, every coordinate pair should be separated by a single space. Coordinates should be an integers not exceeding $ 10^{9} $ by absolute value.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one desired triangle. If there is more than one answer, print any of them.",
