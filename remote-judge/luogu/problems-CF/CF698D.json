    "description": "Bearland is a dangerous place. Limak can\u2019t travel on foot. Instead, he has $ k $ magic teleportation stones. Each stone can be used at most once. The $ i $ -th stone allows to teleport to a point $ (ax_{i},ay_{i}) $ . Limak can use stones in any order.\n\nThere are $ n $ monsters in Bearland. The $ i $ -th of them stands at $ (mx_{i},my_{i}) $ .\n\nThe given $ k+n $ points are pairwise distinct.\n\nAfter each teleportation, Limak can shoot an arrow in some direction. An arrow will hit the first monster in the chosen direction. Then, both an arrow and a monster disappear. It\u2019s dangerous to stay in one place for long, so Limak can shoot only one arrow from one place.\n\nA monster should be afraid if it\u2019s possible that Limak will hit it. How many monsters should be afraid of Limak?",

    "hint": "In the first sample, there are two stones and four monsters. Stones allow to teleport to points $ (-2,-1) $ and $ (4,5) $ , marked blue in the drawing below. Monsters are at $ (4,2) $ , $ (2,1) $ , $ (4,-1) $ and $ (1,-1) $ , marked red. A monster at $ (4,-1) $ shouldn't be afraid because it's impossible that Limak will hit it with an arrow. Other three monsters can be hit and thus the answer is $ 3 $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF698D/70ee2c528dc792a1ade2fc595342213b793a806e.png)In the second sample, five monsters should be afraid.
