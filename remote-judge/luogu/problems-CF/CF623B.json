    "description": "You are given array $ a_{i} $ of length $ n $ . You may consecutively apply two operations to this array:\n\n- remove some subsegment (continuous subsequence) of length $ m<n $ and pay for it $ m\u00b7a $ coins;\n- change some elements of the array by at most $ 1 $ , and pay $ b $ coins for each change.\n\nPlease note that each of operations may be applied at most once (and may be not applied at all) so you can remove only one segment and each number may be changed (increased or decreased) by at most $ 1 $ . Also note, that you are not allowed to delete the whole array.\n\nYour goal is to calculate the minimum number of coins that you need to spend in order to make the greatest common divisor of the elements of the resulting array be greater than $ 1 $ .",
