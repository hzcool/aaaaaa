    "description": "You are given a graph with $ n $ nodes and $ m $ directed edges. One lowercase letter is assigned to each node. We define a path's value as the number of the most frequently occurring letter. For example, if letters on a path are \"abaca\", then the value of that path is $ 3 $ . Your task is find a path whose value is the largest.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two positive integers $ n,m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=300000 $ ), denoting that the graph has $ n $ nodes and $ m $ directed edges.\n\nThe second line contains a string $ s $ with only lowercase English letters. The $ i $ -th character is the letter assigned to the $ i $ -th node.\n\nThen $ m $ lines follow. Each line contains two integers $ x,y $ ( $ 1<=x,y<=n $ ), describing a directed edge from $ x $ to $ y $ . Note that $ x $ can be equal to $ y $ and there can be multiple edges between $ x $ and $ y $ . Also the graph can be not connected.",
    "outputFormat": "Output a single line with a single integer denoting the largest value. If the value can be arbitrarily large, output -1 instead.",
