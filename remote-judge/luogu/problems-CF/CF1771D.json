    "description": "Hossam has an unweighted tree $ G $ with letters in vertices.\n\nHossam defines $ s(v, \\, u) $ as a string that is obtained by writing down all the letters on the unique simple path from the vertex $ v $ to the vertex $ u $ in the tree $ G $ .\n\nA string $ a $ is a subsequence of a string $ s $ if $ a $ can be obtained from $ s $ by deletion of several (possibly, zero) letters. For example, \"dores\", \"cf\", and \"for\" are subsequences of \"codeforces\", while \"decor\" and \"fork\" are not.\n\nA palindrome is a string that reads the same from left to right and from right to left. For example, \"abacaba\" is a palindrome, but \"abac\" is not.\n\nHossam defines a sub-palindrome of a string $ s $ as a subsequence of $ s $ , that is a palindrome. For example, \"k\", \"abba\" and \"abhba\" are sub-palindromes of the string \"abhbka\", but \"abka\" and \"cat\" are not.\n\nHossam defines a maximal sub-palindrome of a string $ s $ as a sub-palindrome of $ s $ , which has the maximal length among all sub-palindromes of $ s $ . For example, \"abhbka\" has only one maximal sub-palindrome \u2014 \"abhba\". But it may also be that the string has several maximum sub-palindromes: the string \"abcd\" has $ 4 $ maximum sub-palindromes.\n\nHelp Hossam find the length of the longest maximal sub-palindrome among all $ s(v, \\, u) $ in the tree $ G $ .\n\nNote that the sub-palindrome is a subsequence, not a substring.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 200 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case has one integer number $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^3 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nThe second line contains a string $ s $ of length $ n $ , the $ i $ -th symbol of which denotes the letter on the vertex $ i $ . It is guaranteed that all characters in this string are lowercase English letters.\n\nThe next $ n - 1 $ lines describe the edges of the tree. Each edge is given by two integers $ v $ and $ u $ ( $ 1 \\le v, \\, u \\le n $ , $ v \\neq u $ ). These two numbers mean that there is an edge $ (v, \\, u) $ in the tree. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nIt is guaranteed that sum of all $ n $ doesn't exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^3 $ .",
