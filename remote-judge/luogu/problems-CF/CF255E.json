    "description": "Furlo and Rublo play a game. The table has $ n $ piles of coins lying on it, the $ i $ -th pile has $ a_{i} $ coins. Furlo and Rublo move in turns, Furlo moves first. In one move you are allowed to:\n\n- choose some pile, let's denote the current number of coins in it as $ x $ ;\n- choose some integer $ y $ $ (0<=y&lt;x;\u00a0x^{1/4}<=y<=x^{1/2}) $ and decrease the number of coins in this pile to $ y $ . In other words, after the described move the pile will have $ y $ coins left.\n\nThe player who can't make a move, loses.\n\nYour task is to find out, who wins in the given game if both Furlo and Rublo play optimally well.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=77777) $ \u2014 the number of piles. The next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=777777777777) $ \u2014 the sizes of piles. The numbers are separated by single spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.",
