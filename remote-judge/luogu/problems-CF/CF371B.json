    "description": "Two little greedy bears have found two pieces of cheese in the forest of weight $ a $ and $ b $ grams, correspondingly. The bears are so greedy that they are ready to fight for the larger piece. That's where the fox comes in and starts the dialog: \"Little bears, wait a little, I want to make your pieces equal\" \"Come off it fox, how are you going to do that?\", the curious bears asked. \"It's easy\", said the fox. \"If the mass of a certain piece is divisible by two, then I can eat exactly a half of the piece. If the mass of a certain piece is divisible by three, then I can eat exactly two-thirds, and if the mass is divisible by five, then I can eat four-fifths. I'll eat a little here and there and make the pieces equal\".\n\nThe little bears realize that the fox's proposal contains a catch. But at the same time they realize that they can not make the two pieces equal themselves. So they agreed to her proposal, but on one condition: the fox should make the pieces equal as quickly as possible. Find the minimum number of operations the fox needs to make pieces equal.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two space-separated integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1<=a,b<=10^{9} $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "If the fox is lying to the little bears and it is impossible to make the pieces equal, print -1. Otherwise, print the required minimum number of operations. If the pieces of the cheese are initially equal, the required number is 0.",
