    "description": "Pak Chanek is participating in a lemper cooking competition. In the competition, Pak Chanek has to cook lempers with $ N $ stoves that are arranged sequentially from stove $ 1 $ to stove $ N $ . Initially, stove $ i $ has a temperature of $ A_i $ degrees. A stove can have a negative temperature.\n\nPak Chanek realises that, in order for his lempers to be cooked, he needs to keep the temperature of each stove at a non-negative value. To make it happen, Pak Chanek can do zero or more operations. In one operation, Pak Chanek chooses one stove $ i $ with $ 2 \\leq i \\leq N-1 $ , then:\n\n1. changes the temperature of stove $ i-1 $ into $ A_{i-1} := A_{i-1} + A_{i} $ ,\n2. changes the temperature of stove $ i+1 $ into $ A_{i+1} := A_{i+1} + A_{i} $ , and\n3. changes the temperature of stove $ i $ into $ A_i := -A_i $ .\n\nPak Chanek wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs to do such that the temperatures of all stoves are at non-negative values. Help Pak Chanek by telling him the minimum number of operations needed or by reporting if it is not possible to do.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ N $ ( $ 1 \\le N \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of stoves.\n\nThe second line contains $ N $ integers $ A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N $ ( $ -10^9 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the initial temperatures of the stoves.",
