    "description": "Kolya has a turtle and a field of size $ 2 \\times n $ . The field rows are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ 2 $ from top to bottom, while the columns are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from left to right.\n\nSuppose in each cell of the field there is a lettuce leaf. The energy value of lettuce leaf in row $ i $ and column $ j $ is equal to $ a_{i,j} $ . The turtle is initially in the top left cell and wants to reach the bottom right cell. The turtle can only move right and down and among all possible ways it will choose a way, maximizing the total energy value of lettuce leaves (in case there are several such paths, it will choose any of them).\n\nKolya is afraid, that if turtle will eat too much lettuce, it can be bad for its health. So he wants to reorder lettuce leaves in the field, so that the energetic cost of leaves eaten by turtle will be minimized.",
