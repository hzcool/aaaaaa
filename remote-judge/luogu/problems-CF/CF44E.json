    "description": "Anfisa the monkey learns to type. She is yet unfamiliar with the \"space\" key and can only type in lower-case Latin letters. Having typed for a fairly long line, Anfisa understood that it would be great to divide what she has written into $ k $ lines not shorter than $ a $ and not longer than $ b $ , for the text to resemble human speech more. Help Anfisa.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ k $ , $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1<=k<=200 $ , $ 1<=a<=b<=200 $ ). The second line contains a sequence of lowercase Latin letters \u2014 the text typed by Anfisa. It is guaranteed that the given line is not empty and its length does not exceed $ 200 $ symbols.",
    "outputFormat": "Print $ k $ lines, each of which contains no less than $ a $ and no more than $ b $ symbols \u2014 Anfisa's text divided into lines. It is not allowed to perform any changes in the text, such as: deleting or adding symbols, changing their order, etc. If the solution is not unique, print any of them. If there is no solution, print \"No solution\" (without quotes).",
