    "description": "Some days ago, I learned the concept of LCM (least common multiple). I've played with it for several times and I want to make a big number with it.\n\nBut I also don't want to use many numbers, so I'll choose three positive integers (they don't have to be distinct) which are not greater than $ n $ . Can you help me to find the maximum possible least common multiple of these three integers?",

    "hint": "The least common multiple of some positive integers is the least positive integer which is multiple for each of them.\n\nThe result may become very large, 32-bit integer won't be enough. So using 64-bit integers is recommended.\n\nFor the last example, we can chose numbers $ 7 $ , $ 6 $ , $ 5 $ and the LCM of them is $ 7\u00b76\u00b75=210 $ . It is the maximum value we can get.",
