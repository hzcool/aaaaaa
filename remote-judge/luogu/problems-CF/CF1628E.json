    "description": "Mihai lives in a town where meteor storms are a common problem. It's annoying, because Mihai has to buy groceries sometimes, and getting hit by meteors isn't fun. Therefore, we ask you to find the most dangerous way to buy groceries so that we can trick him to go there.\n\nThe town has $ n $ buildings numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Some buildings have roads between them, and there is exactly $ 1 $ simple path from any building to any other building. Each road has a certain meteor danger level. The buildings all have grocery stores, but Mihai only cares about the open ones, of course. Initially, all the grocery stores are closed.\n\nYou are given $ q $ queries of three types:\n\n1. Given the integers $ l $ and $ r $ , the buildings numbered from $ l $ to $ r $ open their grocery stores (nothing happens to buildings in the range that already have an open grocery store).\n2. Given the integers $ l $ and $ r $ , the buildings numbered from $ l $ to $ r $ close their grocery stores (nothing happens to buildings in the range that didn't have an open grocery store).\n3. Given the integer $ x $ , find the maximum meteor danger level on the simple path from $ x $ to any open grocery store, or $ -1 $ if there is no edge on any simple path to an open store.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains the two integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 2 \\le n, q \\le 3\\cdot 10^5 $ ).\n\nThen follows $ n - 1 $ lines, the $ i $ -th of which containing the integers $ u_i $ , $ v_i $ , and $ w_i $ ( $ 1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n, \\enspace 1 \\le w_i \\le 10^9 $ ) meaning there is two way road between building $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ with meteor danger level $ w_i $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nThen follows $ q $ lines, the $ j $ -th of which begin with the integer $ t_j $ ( $ 1 \\le t_j \\le 3 $ ), meaning the $ j $ -th query is of the $ t_j $ -th type.\n\nIf $ t_j $ is $ 1 $ or $ 2 $ the rest of the line contains the integers $ l_j $ and $ r_j $ ( $ 1 \\le l_j \\le r_j \\le n $ ).\n\nIf $ t_j $ is $ 3 $ the rest of the line contains the integer $ x_j $ ( $ 1 \\le x_j \\le n $ ).",

In the sixth query, there are two paths from $ x_j = 4 $ to some open grocery store: $ 4 $ to $ 5 $ and $ 4 $ to $ 6 $ . The biggest meteor danger is found on the edge from $ 4 $ to $ 6 $ , so the answer for the $ 6 $ th query is $ 4 $ .
