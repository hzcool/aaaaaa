    "description": "This in an interactive problem.\n\nThere is an unknown tree consisting of $ n $ nodes, which has exactly one centroid. You only know $ n $ at first, and your task is to find the centroid of the tree.\n\nYou can ask the distance between any two vertices for at most $ 2\\cdot10^5 $ times.\n\nNote that the interactor is not adaptive. That is, the tree is fixed in each test beforehand and does not depend on your queries.\n\nA vertex is called a centroid if its removal splits the tree into subtrees with at most $ \\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor $ vertices each.",
    "inputFormat": "The only line of the input contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 3\\le n\\le 7.5\\cdot10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of nodes in the tree.",
    "outputFormat": "Start interaction by reading $ n $ .\n\nTo ask a query about the distance between two nodes $ u, v $ ( $ 1 \\le u, v \\le n $ ), output \"? u v\".\n\nIf you determine that the centroid of the tree is $ x $ , use \"! x\" to report.\n\nAfter printing a query, do not forget to output the end of a line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks are disabled in this problem.\n\nIt's guaranteed that there are at most $ 500 $ tests in this problem.",
