    "hint": "For the first test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence $ \\{{2, 3}\\} $ of size $ 2 $ . The binary representation of $ 2 $ is 10 and that of $ 3 $ is 11. Since $ \\max(k - 2, 1) $ is equal to $ 1 $ , the value of the subsequence is $ 2^0 + 2^1 $ (both $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ have $ 1 $ -st bit set in their binary representation and $ 3 $ has $ 0 $ -th bit set in its binary representation). Note that he could also pick the subsequence $ \\{{3\\}} $ or $ \\{{2, 1, 3\\}} $ .\n\nFor the second test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence $ \\{{3, 4\\}} $ with value $ 7 $ .\n\nFor the third test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence $ \\{{1\\}} $ with value $ 1 $ .\n\nFor the fourth test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence $ \\{{7, 7\\}} $ with value $ 7 $ .",
