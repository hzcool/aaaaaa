    "description": "Timur has a stairway with $ n $ steps. The $ i $ -th step is $ a_i $ meters higher than its predecessor. The first step is $ a_1 $ meters higher than the ground, and the ground starts at $ 0 $ meters.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1742E/1bd007a2ef6a288af14a4e7592f626054d160b81.png)The stairs for the first test case.Timur has $ q $ questions, each denoted by an integer $ k_1, \\dots, k_q $ . For each question $ k_i $ , you have to print the maximum possible height Timur can achieve by climbing the steps if his legs are of length $ k_i $ . Timur can only climb the $ j $ -th step if his legs are of length at least $ a_j $ . In other words, $ k_i \\geq a_j $ for each step $ j $ climbed.\n\nNote that you should answer each question independently.",
