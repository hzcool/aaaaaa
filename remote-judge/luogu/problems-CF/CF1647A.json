    "description": "Madoka finally found the administrator password for her computer. Her father is a well-known popularizer of mathematics, so the password is the answer to the following problem.\n\nFind the maximum decimal number without zeroes and with no equal digits in a row, such that the sum of its digits is $ n $ .\n\nMadoka is too tired of math to solve it herself, so help her to solve this problem!",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 1000 $ ) \u2014 the required sum of the digits.",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case print the maximum number you can obtain.",

    "hint": "The only numbers with the sum of digits equal to $ 2 $ without zeros are $ 2 $ and $ 11 $ . But the last one has two ones in a row, so it's not valid. That's why the answer is $ 2 $ .\n\nThe only numbers with the sum of digits equal to $ 3 $ without zeros are $ 111 $ , $ 12 $ , $ 21 $ , and $ 3 $ . The first one has $ 2 $ ones in a row, so it's not valid. So the maximum valid number is $ 21 $ .\n\nThe only numbers with the sum of digits equals to $ 4 $ without zeros are $ 1111 $ , $ 211 $ , $ 121 $ , $ 112 $ , $ 13 $ , $ 31 $ , $ 22 $ , and $ 4 $ . Numbers $ 1111 $ , $ 211 $ , $ 112 $ , $ 22 $ aren't valid, because they have some identical digits in a row. So the maximum valid number is $ 121 $ .",
