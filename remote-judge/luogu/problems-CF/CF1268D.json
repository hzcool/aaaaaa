You only need to find this value modulo $ 998\\,244\\,353 $ .",

If $ j $ -th character of $ i $ -th string is equal to '1', then the graph has an edge $ i \\to j $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that there are no edges $ i \\to i $ and the graph has exactly one edge among $ i \\to j $ and $ j \\to i $ for different $ i $ and $ j $ .",
