    "description": "This is an interactive problem.\n\nLi Ming and Li Hua are playing a game. Li Hua has a chessboard of size $ n\\times m $ . Denote $ (r, c) $ ( $ 1\\le r\\le n, 1\\le c\\le m $ ) as the cell on the $ r $ -th row from the top and on the $ c $ -th column from the left. Li Ming put a king on the chessboard and Li Hua needs to guess its position.\n\nLi Hua can ask Li Ming no more than $ 3 $  questions. In each question, he can choose a cell and ask the minimum steps needed to move the king to the chosen cell. Each question is independent, which means the king doesn't actually move.\n\nA king can move from $ (x,y) $ to $ (x',y') $ if and only if $ \\max\\{|x-x'|,|y-y'|\\}=1 $ (shown in the following picture).\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1797C/56c04da34d7867634f352a46b9f12f7f08ae1115.png)The position of the king is chosen before the interaction.\n\nSuppose you were Li Hua, please solve this problem.",

Then you should input the response from standard input \u2014 the minimum steps the king needs to move to the chosen cell.\n\nIf your program has asked an invalid question or has run out of questions, the interactor will terminate immediately and your program will get a verdict Wrong answer.\n\nTo give the final answer, print \"! $ r $ $ c $ \" (without the quotes, $ (r,c) $ is the king's initial coordinate). Note that giving this answer is not counted towards the limit of $ 3 $ questions.\n\nAfter asking a question do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output.
