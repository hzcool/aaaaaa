    "description": "You are organizing a boxing tournament, where $ n $ boxers will participate ( $ n $ is a power of $ 2 $ ), and your friend is one of them. All boxers have different strength from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , and boxer $ i $ wins in the match against boxer $ j $ if and only if $ i $ is stronger than $ j $ .\n\nThe tournament will be organized as follows: $ n $ boxers will be divided into pairs; the loser in each pair leaves the tournament, and $ \\frac{n}{2} $ winners advance to the next stage, where they are divided into pairs again, and the winners in all pairs advance to the next stage, and so on, until only one boxer remains (who is declared the winner).\n\nYour friend really wants to win the tournament, but he may be not the strongest boxer. To help your friend win the tournament, you may bribe his opponents: if your friend is fighting with a boxer you have bribed, your friend wins even if his strength is lower.\n\nFurthermore, during each stage you distribute the boxers into pairs as you wish.\n\nThe boxer with strength $ i $ can be bribed if you pay him $ a_i $ dollars. What is the minimum number of dollars you have to spend to make your friend win the tournament, provided that you arrange the boxers into pairs during each stage as you wish?",
