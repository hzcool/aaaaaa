    "description": "Bethany would like to tile her bathroom. The bathroom has width $ w $ centimeters and length $ l $ centimeters. If Bethany simply used the basic tiles of size $ 1 \\times 1 $ centimeters, she would use $ w \\cdot l $ of them.\n\nHowever, she has something different in mind.\n\n- On the interior of the floor she wants to use the $ 1 \\times 1 $ tiles. She needs exactly $ (w-2) \\cdot (l-2) $ of these.\n- On the floor boundary she wants to use tiles of size $ 1 \\times a $ for some positive integer $ a $ . The tiles can also be rotated by $ 90 $ degrees.\n\nFor which values of $ a $ can Bethany tile the bathroom floor as described? Note that $ a $ can also be $ 1 $ .",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1\\le t\\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The descriptions of the $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case consist of a single line, which contains two integers $ w $ , $ l $ ( $ 3 \\leq w, l \\leq 10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the dimensions of the bathroom.",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, print an integer $ k $ ( $ 0\\le k $ ) \u2014 the number of valid values of $ a $ for the given test case \u2014 followed by $ k $ integers $ a_1, a_2,\\dots, a_k $ ( $ 1\\le a_i $ ) \u2014 the valid values of $ a $ . The values $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k $ have to be sorted from smallest to largest.\n\nIt is guaranteed that under the problem constraints, the output contains at most $ 200\\,000 $ integers.",

    "hint": "In the first test case, the bathroom is $ 3 $ centimeters wide and $ 5 $ centimeters long. There are three values of $ a $ such that Bethany can tile the floor as described in the statement, namely $ a=1 $ , $ a=2 $ and $ a=3 $ . The three tilings are represented in the following pictures.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1662H/19788a116ad9fe845c10cae52ec3a1f0f92abbbb.png)"
