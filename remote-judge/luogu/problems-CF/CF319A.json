    "description": "As a tradition, every year before IOI all the members of Natalia Fan Club are invited to Malek Dance Club to have a fun night together. Malek Dance Club has $ 2^{n} $ members and coincidentally Natalia Fan Club also has $ 2^{n} $ members. Each member of MDC is assigned a unique id $ i $ from $ 0 $ to $ 2^{n}-1 $ . The same holds for each member of NFC.\n\nOne of the parts of this tradition is one by one dance, where each member of MDC dances with a member of NFC. A dance pair is a pair of numbers $ (a,b) $ such that member $ a $ from MDC dances with member $ b $ from NFC.\n\nThe complexity of a pairs' assignment is the number of pairs of dancing pairs $ (a,b) $ and $ (c,d) $ such that $ a&lt;c $ and $ b&gt;d $ .\n\nYou are given a binary number of length $ n $ named $ x $ . We know that member $ i $ from MDC dances with member ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF319A/99db469180d6ab11deff381b4df066112345cbb1.png) from NFC. Your task is to calculate the complexity of this assignment modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .\n\nExpression ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF319A/a0b0fe9e9428287337c0277ea02ca07fcf0a01a7.png) denotes applying \u00abXOR\u00bb to numbers $ x $ and $ y $ . This operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, in C++ and Java it denotes as \u00ab^\u00bb, in Pascal \u2014 \u00abxor\u00bb.",
