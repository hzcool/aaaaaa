    "description": "Iahub and Iahubina went to a picnic in a forest full of trees. Less than 5 minutes passed before Iahub remembered of trees from programming. Moreover, he invented a new problem and Iahubina has to solve it, otherwise Iahub won't give her the food.\n\nIahub asks Iahubina: can you build a rooted tree, such that\n\n- each internal node (a node with at least one son) has at least two sons;\n- node $ i $ has $ c_{i} $ nodes in its subtree?\n\nIahubina has to guess the tree. Being a smart girl, she realized that it's possible no tree can follow Iahub's restrictions. In this way, Iahub will eat all the food. You need to help Iahubina: determine if there's at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions. The required tree must contain $ n $ nodes.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=24 $ ). Next line contains $ n $ positive integers: the $ i $ -th number represents $ c_{i} $ $ (1<=c_{i}<=n) $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Output on the first line \"YES\" (without quotes) if there exist at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions, otherwise output \"NO\" (without quotes).",
