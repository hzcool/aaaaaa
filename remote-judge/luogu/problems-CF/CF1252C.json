    "description": "Pathfinding is a task of finding a route between two points. It often appears in many problems. For example, in a GPS navigation software where a driver can query for a suggested route, or in a robot motion planning where it should find a valid sequence of movements to do some tasks, or in a simple maze solver where it should find a valid path from one point to another point. This problem is related to solving a maze.\n\nThe maze considered in this problem is in the form of a matrix of integers $ A $ of $ N \\times N $ . The value of each cell is generated from a given array $ R $ and $ C $ of $ N $ integers each. Specifically, the value on the $ i^{th} $ row and $ j^{th} $ column, cell $ (i,j) $ , is equal to $ R_i + C_j $ . Note that all indexes in this problem are from $ 1 $ to $ N $ .\n\nA path in this maze is defined as a sequence of cells $ (r_1,c_1), (r_2,c_2), \\dots, (r_k,c_k) $ such that $ |r_i - r_{i+1}| + |c_i - c_{i+1}| = 1 $ for all $ 1 \\le i < k $ . In other words, each adjacent cell differs only by $ 1 $ row or only by $ 1 $ column. An even path in this maze is defined as a path in which all the cells in the path contain only even numbers.\n\nGiven a tuple $ \\langle r_a,c_a,r_b,c_b \\rangle $ as a query, your task is to determine whether there exists an even path from cell $ (r_a,c_a) $ to cell $ (r_b,c_b) $ . To simplify the problem, it is guaranteed that both cell $ (r_a,c_a) $ and cell $ (r_b,c_b) $ contain even numbers.\n\nFor example, let $ N = 5 $ , $ R = \\{6, 2, 7, 8, 3\\} $ , and $ C = \\{3, 4, 8, 5, 1\\} $ . The following figure depicts the matrix $ A $ of $ 5 \\times 5 $ which is generated from the given array $ R $ and $ C $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1252C/bfefd5b3fc308f224043cfc77f140d207f38f3a0.png)Let us consider several queries:\n\n- $ \\langle 2, 2, 1, 3 \\rangle $ : There is an even path from cell $ (2,2) $ to cell $ (1,3) $ , e.g., $ (2,2), (2,3), (1,3) $ . Of course, $ (2,2), (1,2), (1,3) $ is also a valid even path.\n- $ \\langle 4, 2, 4, 3 \\rangle $ : There is an even path from cell $ (4,2) $ to cell $ (4,3) $ , namely $ (4,2), (4,3) $ .\n- $ \\langle 5, 1, 3, 4 \\rangle $ : There is no even path from cell $ (5,1) $ to cell $ (3,4) $ . Observe that the only two neighboring cells of $ (5,1) $ are cell $ (5,2) $ and cell $ (4,1) $ , and both of them contain odd numbers (7 and 11, respectively), thus, there cannot be any even path originating from cell $ (5,1) $ .",
    "inputFormat": "Input begins with a line containing two integers: $ N $ $ Q $ ( $ 2 \\le N \\le 100\\,000 $ ; $ 1 \\le Q \\le 100\\,000 $ ) representing the size of the maze and the number of queries, respectively. The next line contains $ N $ integers: $ R_i $ ( $ 0 \\le R_i \\le 10^6 $ ) representing the array $ R $ . The next line contains $ N $ integers: $ C_i $ ( $ 0 \\le C_i \\le 10^6 $ ) representing the array $ C $ . The next $ Q $ lines each contains four integers: $ r_a $ $ c_a $ $ r_b $ $ c_b $ ( $ 1 \\le r_a, c_a, r_b, c_b \\le N $ ) representing a query of $ \\langle r_a, c_a, r_b, c_b \\rangle $ . It is guaranteed that $ (r_a,c_a) $ and $ (r_b,c_b) $ are two different cells in the maze and both of them contain even numbers.",
