    "description": "Happy PMP is freshman and he is learning about algorithmic problems. He enjoys playing algorithmic games a lot.\n\nOne of the seniors gave Happy PMP a nice game. He is given two permutations of numbers $ 1 $ through $ n $ and is asked to convert the first one to the second. In one move he can remove the last number from the permutation of numbers and inserts it back in an arbitrary position. He can either insert last number between any two consecutive numbers, or he can place it at the beginning of the permutation.\n\nHappy PMP has an algorithm that solves the problem. But it is not fast enough. He wants to know the minimum number of moves to convert the first permutation to the second.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2\u00b710^{5} $ ) \u2014 the quantity of the numbers in the both given permutations.\n\nNext line contains $ n $ space-separated integers \u2014 the first permutation. Each number between $ 1 $ to $ n $ will appear in the permutation exactly once.\n\nNext line describe the second permutation in the same format.",

After that he takes number 2 and places it between 1 and 3.\n\nIn the second sample, he removes number 5 and inserts it after 1.\n\nIn the third sample, the sequence of changes are like this:\n\n- 1 5 2 3 4\n- 1 4 5 2 3\n- 1 3 4 5 2\n- 1 2 3 4 5\n\n So he needs three moves.",
