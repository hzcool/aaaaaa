    "description": "Alex doesn't like boredom. That's why whenever he gets bored, he comes up with games. One long winter evening he came up with a game and decided to play it.\n\nGiven a sequence $ a $ consisting of $ n $ integers. The player can make several steps. In a single step he can choose an element of the sequence (let's denote it $ a_{k} $ ) and delete it, at that all elements equal to $ a_{k}+1 $ and $ a_{k}-1 $ also must be deleted from the sequence. That step brings $ a_{k} $ points to the player.\n\nAlex is a perfectionist, so he decided to get as many points as possible. Help him.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) that shows how many numbers are in Alex's sequence.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1} $ , $ a_{2} $ , ..., $ a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{5} $ ).",
