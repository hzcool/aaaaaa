    "description": "Inna loves sweets very much. That's why she wants to play the \"Sweet Matrix\" game with Dima and Sereja. But Sereja is a large person, so the game proved small for him. Sereja suggested playing the \"Large Sweet Matrix\" game.\n\nThe \"Large Sweet Matrix\" playing field is an $ n\u00d7m $ matrix. Let's number the rows of the matrix from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , and the columns \u2014 from $ 1 $ to $ m $ . Let's denote the cell in the $ i $ -th row and $ j $ -th column as $ (i,j) $ . Each cell of the matrix can contain multiple candies, initially all cells are empty. The game goes in $ w $ moves, during each move one of the two following events occurs:\n\n1. Sereja chooses five integers $ x_{1},y_{1},x_{2},y_{2},v $ $ (x_{1}<=x_{2},y_{1}<=y_{2}) $ and adds $ v $ candies to each matrix cell $ (i,j) $ $ (x_{1}<=i<=x_{2};\u00a0y_{1}<=j<=y_{2}) $ .\n2. Sereja chooses four integers $ x_{1},y_{1},x_{2},y_{2} $ $ (x_{1}<=x_{2},y_{1}<=y_{2}) $ . Then he asks Dima to calculate the total number of candies in cells $ (i,j) $ $ (x_{1}<=i<=x_{2};\u00a0y_{1}<=j<=y_{2}) $ and he asks Inna to calculate the total number of candies in the cells of matrix $ (p,q) $ , which meet the following logical criteria: ( $ p&lt;x_{1} $ OR $ p&gt;x_{2} $ ) AND ( $ q&lt;y_{1} $ OR $ q&gt;y_{2} $ ). Finally, Sereja asks to write down the difference between the number Dima has calculated and the number Inna has calculated (D - I).\n\nUnfortunately, Sereja's matrix is really huge. That's why Inna and Dima aren't coping with the calculating. Help them!",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ w $ $ (3<=n,m<=4\u00b710^{6};\u00a01<=w<=10^{5}) $ .\n\nThe next $ w $ lines describe the moves that were made in the game.\n\n- A line that describes an event of the first type contains 6 integers: $ 0 $ , $ x_{1} $ , $ y_{1} $ , $ x_{2} $ , $ y_{2} $ and $ v $ $ (1<=x_{1}<=x_{2}<=n;\u00a01<=y_{1}<=y_{2}<=m;\u00a01<=v<=10^{9}) $ .\n- A line that describes an event of the second type contains 5 integers: $ 1 $ , $ x_{1} $ , $ y_{1} $ , $ x_{2} $ , $ y_{2} $ $ (2<=x_{1}<=x_{2}<=n-1;\u00a02<=y_{1}<=y_{2}<=m-1) $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the second type move occurs at least once. It is guaranteed that a single operation will not add more than $ 10^{9} $ candies.\n\nBe careful, the constraints are very large, so please use optimal data structures. Max-tests will be in pretests.",
