    "description": "Finally Fox Ciel arrived in front of her castle!\n\nShe have to type a password to enter her castle. An input device attached to her castle is a bit unusual.\n\nThe input device is a $ 1\u00d7n $ rectangle divided into $ n $ square panels. They are numbered $ 1 $ to $ n $ from left to right. Each panel has a state either ON or OFF. Initially all panels are in the OFF state. She can enter her castle if and only if $ x_{1} $ -th, $ x_{2} $ -th, $ ... $ , $ x_{k} $ -th panels are in the ON state and other panels are in the OFF state.\n\nShe is given an array $ a_{1} $ , $ ... $ , $ a_{l} $ . In each move, she can perform the following operation: choose an index $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=l $ ), choose consecutive $ a_{i} $ panels, and flip the states of those panels (i.e. ON $ \u2192 $ OFF, OFF $ \u2192 $ ON).\n\nUnfortunately she forgets how to type the password with only above operations. Determine the minimal number of operations required to enter her castle.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ k $ and $ l $ ( $ 1<=n<=10000,1<=k<=10,1<=l<=100 $ ), separated by single spaces.\n\nThe second line contains $ k $ integers $ x_{1} $ , ..., $ x_{k} $ ( $ 1<=x_{1}&lt;x_{2}&lt;...&lt;x_{k}<=n $ ), separated by single spaces.\n\nThe third line contains $ l $ integers $ a_{1} $ , ..., $ a_{l} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=n $ ), separated by single spaces. It is possible that some elements of the array $ a_{i} $ are equal value.",
