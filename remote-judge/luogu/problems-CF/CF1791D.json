    "description": "Let's denote the $ f(x) $ function for a string $ x $ as the number of distinct characters that the string contains. For example $ f(\\texttt{abc}) = 3 $ , $ f(\\texttt{bbbbb}) = 1 $ , and $ f(\\texttt{babacaba}) = 3 $ .\n\nGiven a string $ s $ , split it into two non-empty strings $ a $ and $ b $ such that $ f(a) + f(b) $ is the maximum possible. In other words, find the maximum possible value of $ f(a) + f(b) $ such that $ a + b = s $ (the concatenation of string $ a $ and string $ b $ is equal to string $ s $ ).",

The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot10^5 $ ) \u2014 the length of the string $ s $ .\n\nThe second line contains the string $ s $ , consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2\\cdot10^5 $ .",
