As he is only a little bear, he was told to decorate only one simple path between some pair of nodes. Though he was given an opportunity to pick the pair himself! Now he wants to know the number of unordered pairs of indices $ (u,v) $ ( $ u<=v $ ), such that the sum of indices of all nodes along the simple path between $ u $ and $ v $ (including endpoints) is equal to $ s $ . Can you help him and count this value?",
