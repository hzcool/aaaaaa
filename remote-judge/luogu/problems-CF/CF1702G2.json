    "description": "This is a hard version of the problem. The only difference between an easy and a hard version is in the number of queries.\n\nPolycarp grew a tree from $ n $ vertices. We remind you that a tree of $ n $ vertices is an undirected connected graph of $ n $ vertices and $ n-1 $ edges that does not contain cycles.\n\nHe calls a set of vertices passable if there is such a path in the tree that passes through each vertex of this set without passing through any edge twice. The path can visit other vertices (not from this set).\n\nIn other words, a set of vertices is called passable if there is a simple path that passes through all the vertices of this set (and possibly some other).\n\nFor example, for a tree below sets $ \\{3, 2, 5\\} $ , $ \\{1, 5, 4\\} $ , $ \\{1, 4\\} $ are passable, and $ \\{1, 3, 5\\} $ , $ \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\} $ are not.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1702G2/0977138472fa4ec56403c02976f275aa67a6c22b.png)Polycarp asks you to answer $ q $ queries. Each query is a set of vertices. For each query, you need to determine whether the corresponding set of vertices is passable.",
