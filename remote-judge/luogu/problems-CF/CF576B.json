We call a tree invariant relative to permutation $ p=p_{1}p_{2}...\\ p_{n} $ , if for any two vertices of the tree $ u $ and $ v $ the condition holds: \"vertices $ u $ and $ v $ are connected by an edge if and only if vertices $ p_{u} $ and $ p_{v} $ are connected by an edge\".\n\nYou are given permutation $ p $ of size $ n $ . Find some tree size $ n $ , invariant relative to the given permutation.",

    "outputFormat": "If the sought tree does not exist, print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\nOtherwise, print \"YES\", and then print $ n-1 $ lines, each of which contains two integers \u2014 the numbers of vertices connected by an edge of the tree you found. The vertices are numbered from 1, the order of the edges and the order of the vertices within the edges does not matter.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, output any of them.",
