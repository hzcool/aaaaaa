    "description": "You are given the set of vectors on the plane, each of them starting at the origin. Your task is to find a pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle between them.\n\nNon-oriented angle is non-negative value, minimal between clockwise and counterclockwise direction angles. Non-oriented angle is always between $ 0 $ and $ \u03c0 $ . For example, opposite directions vectors have angle equals to $ \u03c0 $ .",
    "inputFormat": "First line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=100000 $ ) \u2014 the number of vectors.\n\nThe $ i $ -th of the following $ n $ lines contains two integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ |x|,|y|<=10000,x^{2}+y^{2}&gt;0 $ ) \u2014 the coordinates of the $ i $ -th vector. Vectors are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in order of appearing in the input. It is guaranteed that no two vectors in the input share the same direction (but they still can have opposite directions).",
    "outputFormat": "Print two integer numbers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ a\u2260b $ ) \u2014 a pair of indices of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. You can print the numbers in any order. If there are many possible answers, print any.",
