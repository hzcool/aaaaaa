    "description": "In a carnival game, there is a huge pyramid of cans with $ 2023 $ rows, numbered in a regular pattern as shown.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1829G/e0a8819b39df73d7be64e1bb568b787d59d3e814.png)If can $ 9^2 $ is hit initially, then all cans colored red in the picture above would fall.\n\nYou throw a ball at the pyramid, and it hits a single can with number $ n^2 $ . This causes all cans that are stacked on top of this can to fall (that is, can $ n^2 $ falls, then the cans directly above $ n^2 $ fall, then the cans directly above those cans, and so on). For example, the picture above shows the cans that would fall if can $ 9^2 $ is hit.\n\nWhat is the sum of the numbers on all cans that fall? Recall that $ n^2 = n \\times n $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^6 $ ) \u2014 it means that the can you hit has label $ n^2 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the sum of the numbers on all cans that fall.\n\nPlease note, that the answer for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (like long long for C++). For all valid inputs, the answer will always fit into 64-bit integer type.",
