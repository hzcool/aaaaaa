    "description": "Misha decided to help Pasha and Akim be friends again. He had a cunning plan \u2014 to destroy all the laughy mushrooms. He knows that the laughy mushrooms can easily burst when they laugh. Mushrooms grow on the lawns. There are $ a[t] $ mushrooms on the $ t $ -th lawn.\n\nMisha knows that the lawns where the mushrooms grow have a unique ability. A lawn (say, $ i $ ) can transfer laugh to other lawn (say, $ j $ ) if there exists an integer (say, $ b $ ) such, that some permutation of numbers $ a[i],a[j] $ and $ b $ is a beautiful triple ( $ i\u2260j $ ). A beautiful triple is such three pairwise coprime numbers $ x,y,z $ , which satisfy the following condition: $ x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2} $ .\n\nMisha wants to know on which minimal number of lawns he should laugh for all the laughy mushrooms to burst.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{6} $ ) which is the number of lawns. The next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{i} $ which are the number of mushrooms on the $ i $ -lawn ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{7} $ ). All the numbers are different.",
