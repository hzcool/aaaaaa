    "description": "One of Arkady's friends works at a huge radio telescope. A few decades ago the telescope has sent a signal $ s $ towards a faraway galaxy. Recently they've received a response $ t $ which they believe to be a response from aliens! The scientists now want to check if the signal $ t $ is similar to $ s $ .\n\nThe original signal $ s $ was a sequence of zeros and ones (everyone knows that binary code is the universe-wide language). The returned signal $ t $ , however, does not look as easy as $ s $ , but the scientists don't give up! They represented $ t $ as a sequence of English letters and say that $ t $ is similar to $ s $ if you can replace all zeros in $ s $ with some string $ r_0 $ and all ones in $ s $ with some other string $ r_1 $ and obtain $ t $ . The strings $ r_0 $ and $ r_1 $ must be different and non-empty.\n\nPlease help Arkady's friend and find the number of possible replacements for zeros and ones (the number of pairs of strings $ r_0 $ and $ r_1 $ ) that transform $ s $ to $ t $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a string $ s $ ( $ 2 \\le |s| \\le 10^5 $ ) consisting of zeros and ones \u2014 the original signal.\n\nThe second line contains a string $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le |t| \\le 10^6 $ ) consisting of lowercase English letters only \u2014 the received signal.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that the string $ s $ contains at least one '0' and at least one '1'.",
    "outputFormat": "Print a single integer \u2014 the number of pairs of strings $ r_0 $ and $ r_1 $ that transform $ s $ to $ t $ .\n\nIn case there are no such pairs, print $ 0 $ .",

    "hint": "In the first example, the possible pairs $ (r_0, r_1) $ are as follows:\n\n- \"a\", \"aaaaa\"\n- \"aa\", \"aaaa\"\n- \"aaaa\", \"aa\"\n- \"aaaaa\", \"a\"\n\nThe pair \"aaa\", \"aaa\" is not allowed, since $ r_0 $ and $ r_1 $ must be different.\n\nIn the second example, the following pairs are possible:\n\n- \"ko\", \"kokotlin\"\n- \"koko\", \"tlin\"",
