    "description": "One fine morning, $ n $ fools lined up in a row. After that, they numbered each other with numbers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , inclusive. Each fool got a unique number. The fools decided not to change their numbers before the end of the fun.\n\nEvery fool has exactly $ k $ bullets and a pistol. In addition, the fool number $ i $ has probability of $ p_{i} $ (in percent) that he kills the fool he shoots at.\n\nThe fools decided to have several rounds of the fun. Each round of the fun looks like this: each currently living fool shoots at another living fool with the smallest number (a fool is not stupid enough to shoot at himself). All shots of the round are perfomed at one time (simultaneously). If there is exactly one living fool, he does not shoot.\n\nLet's define a situation as the set of numbers of all the living fools at the some time. We say that a situation is possible if for some integer number $ j $ ( $ 0<=j<=k $ ) there is a nonzero probability that after $ j $ rounds of the fun this situation will occur.\n\nValera knows numbers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ and $ k $ . Help Valera determine the number of distinct possible situations.",
