    "description": "Nastya just made a huge mistake and dropped a whole package of rice on the floor. Mom will come soon. If she sees this, then Nastya will be punished.\n\nIn total, Nastya dropped $ n $ grains. Nastya read that each grain weighs some integer number of grams from $ a - b $ to $ a       + b $ , inclusive (numbers $ a $ and $ b $ are known), and the whole package of $ n $ grains weighs from $ c - d $ to $ c +       d $ grams, inclusive (numbers $ c $ and $ d $ are known). The weight of the package is the sum of the weights of all $ n $ grains in it.\n\nHelp Nastya understand if this information can be correct. In other words, check whether each grain can have such a mass that the $ i $ -th grain weighs some integer number $ x_i $ $ (a -       b \\leq x_i \\leq a + b) $ , and in total they weigh from $ c -       d $ to $ c + d $ , inclusive ( $ c - d \\leq       \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{x_i} \\leq c + d $ ).",
    "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ $ (1 \\leq t \\leq 1000) $ \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next $ t $ lines contain descriptions of the test cases, each line contains $ 5 $ integers: $ n $ $ (1 \\leq n \\leq       1000) $ \u2014 the number of grains that Nastya counted and $ a, b,       c, d $ $ (0 \\leq b < a \\leq 1000, 0 \\leq d < c \\leq       1000) $ \u2014 numbers that determine the possible weight of one grain of rice (from $ a - b $ to $ a + b $ ) and the possible total weight of the package (from $ c - d $ to $ c + d $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case given in the input print \"Yes\", if the information about the weights is not inconsistent, and print \"No\" if $ n $ grains with masses from $ a - b $ to $ a + b $ cannot make a package with a total mass from $ c -       d $ to $ c + d $ .",
