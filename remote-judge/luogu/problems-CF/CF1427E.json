    "description": "You have a blackboard and initially only an odd number $ x $ is written on it. Your goal is to write the number $ 1 $ on the blackboard.\n\nYou may write new numbers on the blackboard with the following two operations.\n\n- You may take two numbers (not necessarily distinct) already on the blackboard and write their sum on the blackboard. The two numbers you have chosen remain on the blackboard.\n- You may take two numbers (not necessarily distinct) already on the blackboard and write their [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) on the blackboard. The two numbers you have chosen remain on the blackboard.\n\n Perform a sequence of operations such that at the end the number $ 1 $ is on the blackboard.",
    "inputFormat": "The single line of the input contains the odd integer $ x $ ( $ 3 \\le x \\le 999,999 $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "Print on the first line the number $ q $ of operations you perform. Then $ q $ lines should follow, each describing one operation.\n\n- The \"sum\" operation is described by the line \" $ a $ + $ b $ \", where $ a, b $ must be integers already present on the blackboard.\n- The \"xor\" operation is described by the line \" $ a $ ^ $ b $ \", where $ a, b $ must be integers already present on the blackboard.\n\nThe operation symbol (+ or ^) must be separated from $ a, b $ by a whitespace.You can perform at most $ 100,000 $ operations (that is, $ q\\le 100,000 $ ) and all numbers written on the blackboard must be in the range $ [0, 5\\cdot10^{18}] $ . It can be proven that under such restrictions the required sequence of operations exists. You can output any suitable sequence of operations.",
