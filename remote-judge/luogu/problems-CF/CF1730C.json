    "description": "You have a string $ s $ consisting of digits from $ 0 $ to $ 9 $ inclusive. You can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:\n\n- You can choose a position $ i $ and delete a digit $ d $ on the $ i $ -th position. Then insert the digit $ \\min{(d + 1, 9)} $ on any position (at the beginning, at the end or in between any two adjacent digits).\n\nWhat is the lexicographically smallest string you can get by performing these operations?\n\nA string $ a $ is lexicographically smaller than a string $ b $ of the same length if and only if the following holds:\n\n- in the first position where $ a $ and $ b $ differ, the string $ a $ has a smaller digit than the corresponding digit in $ b $ .",
