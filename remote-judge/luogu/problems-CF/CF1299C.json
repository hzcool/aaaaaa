    "description": "There are $ n $ water tanks in a row, $ i $ -th of them contains $ a_i $ liters of water. The tanks are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from left to right.\n\nYou can perform the following operation: choose some subsegment $ [l, r] $ ( $ 1\\le l \\le r \\le n $ ), and redistribute water in tanks $ l, l+1, \\dots, r $ evenly. In other words, replace each of $ a_l, a_{l+1}, \\dots, a_r $ by $ \\frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \\dots + a_r}{r-l+1} $ . For example, if for volumes $ [1, 3, 6, 7] $ you choose $ l = 2, r = 3 $ , new volumes of water will be $ [1, 4.5, 4.5, 7] $ . You can perform this operation any number of times.\n\nWhat is the lexicographically smallest sequence of volumes of water that you can achieve?\n\nAs a reminder:\n\nA sequence $ a $ is lexicographically smaller than a sequence $ b $ of the same length if and only if the following holds: in the first (leftmost) position where $ a $ and $ b $ differ, the sequence $ a $ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $ b $ .",
