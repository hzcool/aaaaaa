    "description": "Mad scientist Mike does not use slow hard disks. His modification of a hard drive has not one, but $ n $ different heads that can read data in parallel.\n\nWhen viewed from the side, Mike's hard drive is an endless array of tracks. The tracks of the array are numbered from left to right with integers, starting with 1. In the initial state the $ i $ -th reading head is above the track number $ h_{i} $ . For each of the reading heads, the hard drive's firmware can move the head exactly one track to the right or to the left, or leave it on the current track. During the operation each head's movement does not affect the movement of the other heads: the heads can change their relative order; there can be multiple reading heads above any of the tracks. A track is considered read if at least one head has visited this track. In particular, all of the tracks numbered $ h_{1} $ , $ h_{2} $ , $ ... $ , $ h_{n} $ have been read at the beginning of the operation.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF343C/477411d635199d18d36c6b93ba130f0f6f88e682.png)Mike needs to read the data on $ m $ distinct tracks with numbers $ p_{1} $ , $ p_{2} $ , $ ... $ , $ p_{m} $ . Determine the minimum time the hard drive firmware needs to move the heads and read all the given tracks. Note that an arbitrary number of other tracks can also be read.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $ n $ , $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=10^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of disk heads and the number of tracks to read, accordingly. The second line contains $ n $ distinct integers $ h_{i} $ in ascending order ( $ 1<=h_{i}<=10^{10} $ , $ h_{i}&lt;h_{i+1} $ ) \u2014 the initial positions of the heads. The third line contains $ m $ distinct integers $ p_{i} $ in ascending order ( $ 1<=p_{i}<=10^{10} $ , $ p_{i}&lt;p_{i+1} $ ) - the numbers of tracks to read.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++.
