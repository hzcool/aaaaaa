    "description": "You still have partial information about the score during the historic football match. You are given a set of pairs $ (a_i, b_i) $ , indicating that at some point during the match the score was \" $ a_i $ : $ b_i $ \". It is known that if the current score is \u00ab $ x $ : $ y $ \u00bb, then after the goal it will change to \" $ x+1 $ : $ y $ \" or \" $ x $ : $ y+1 $ \". What is the largest number of times a draw could appear on the scoreboard?\n\nThe pairs \" $ a_i $ : $ b_i $ \" are given in chronological order (time increases), but you are given score only for some moments of time. The last pair corresponds to the end of the match.",

The last score denotes the final result of the match.",
