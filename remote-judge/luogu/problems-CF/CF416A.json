    "description": "A TV show called \"Guess a number!\" is gathering popularity. The whole Berland, the old and the young, are watching the show.\n\nThe rules are simple. The host thinks of an integer $ y $ and the participants guess it by asking questions to the host. There are four types of acceptable questions:\n\n- Is it true that $ y $ is strictly larger than number $ x $ ?\n- Is it true that $ y $ is strictly smaller than number $ x $ ?\n- Is it true that $ y $ is larger than or equal to number $ x $ ?\n- Is it true that $ y $ is smaller than or equal to number $ x $ ?\n\nOn each question the host answers truthfully, \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nGiven the sequence of questions and answers, find any integer value of $ y $ that meets the criteria of all answers. If there isn't such value, print \"Impossible\".",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10000 $ ) \u2014 the number of questions (and answers). Next $ n $ lines each contain one question and one answer to it. The format of each line is like that: \"sign x answer\", where the sign is:\n\n- \">\" (for the first type queries),\n- \"<\" (for the second type queries),\n- \">=\" (for the third type queries),\n- \"<=\" (for the fourth type queries).\n\nAll values of $ x $ are integer and meet the inequation $ -10^{9}<=x<=10^{9} $ . The answer is an English letter \"Y\" (for \"yes\") or \"N\" (for \"no\").\n\nConsequtive elements in lines are separated by a single space.",
    "outputFormat": "Print any of such integers $ y $ , that the answers to all the queries are correct. The printed number $ y $ must meet the inequation $ -2\u00b710^{9}<=y<=2\u00b710^{9} $ . If there are many answers, print any of them. If such value doesn't exist, print word \"Impossible\" (without the quotes).",
