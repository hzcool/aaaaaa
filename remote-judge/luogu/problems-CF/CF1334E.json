    "description": "You are given a positive integer $ D $ . Let's build the following graph from it:\n\n- each vertex is a divisor of $ D $ (not necessarily prime, $ 1 $ and $ D $ itself are also included);\n- two vertices $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ x > y $ ) have an undirected edge between them if $ x $ is divisible by $ y $ and $ \\frac x y $ is a prime;\n- the weight of an edge is the number of divisors of $ x $ that are not divisors of $ y $ .\n\nFor example, here is the graph for $ D=12 $ :\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1334E/38b890224bb6f89b8928dfc0b449557b94664dd4.png)Edge $ (4,12) $ has weight $ 3 $ because $ 12 $ has divisors $ [1,2,3,4,6,12] $ and $ 4 $ has divisors $ [1,2,4] $ . Thus, there are $ 3 $ divisors of $ 12 $ that are not divisors of $ 4 $ \u2014 $ [3,6,12] $ .\n\nThere is no edge between $ 3 $ and $ 2 $ because $ 3 $ is not divisible by $ 2 $ . There is no edge between $ 12 $ and $ 3 $ because $ \\frac{12}{3}=4 $ is not a prime.\n\nLet the length of the path between some vertices $ v $ and $ u $ in the graph be the total weight of edges on it. For example, path $ [(1, 2), (2, 6), (6, 12), (12, 4), (4, 2), (2, 6)] $ has length $ 1+2+2+3+1+2=11 $ . The empty path has length $ 0 $ .\n\nSo the shortest path between two vertices $ v $ and $ u $ is the path that has the minimal possible length.\n\nTwo paths $ a $ and $ b $ are different if there is either a different number of edges in them or there is a position $ i $ such that $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ are different edges.\n\nYou are given $ q $ queries of the following form:\n\n- $ v $ $ u $ \u2014 calculate the number of the shortest paths between vertices $ v $ and $ u $ .\n\nThe answer for each query might be large so print it modulo $ 998244353 $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ D $ ( $ 1 \\le D \\le 10^{15} $ ) \u2014 the number the graph is built from.\n\nThe second line contains a single integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \\le q \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nEach of the next $ q $ lines contains two integers $ v $ and $ u $ ( $ 1 \\le v, u \\le D $ ). It is guaranteed that $ D $ is divisible by both $ v $ and $ u $ (both $ v $ and $ u $ are divisors of $ D $ ).",
