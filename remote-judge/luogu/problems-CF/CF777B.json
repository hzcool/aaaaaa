    "description": "After the fourth season Sherlock and Moriary have realized the whole foolishness of the battle between them and decided to continue their competitions in peaceful game of Credit Cards.\n\nRules of this game are simple: each player bring his favourite $ n $ -digit credit card. Then both players name the digits written on their cards one by one. If two digits are not equal, then the player, whose digit is smaller gets a flick (knock in the forehead usually made with a forefinger) from the other player. For example, if $ n=3 $ , Sherlock's card is $ 123 $ and Moriarty's card has number $ 321 $ , first Sherlock names $ 1 $ and Moriarty names $ 3 $ so Sherlock gets a flick. Then they both digit $ 2 $ so no one gets a flick. Finally, Sherlock names $ 3 $ , while Moriarty names $ 1 $ and gets a flick.\n\nOf course, Sherlock will play honestly naming digits one by one in the order they are given, while Moriary, as a true villain, plans to cheat. He is going to name his digits in some other order (however, he is not going to change the overall number of occurences of each digit). For example, in case above Moriarty could name $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ and get no flicks at all, or he can name $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ and $ 1 $ to give Sherlock two flicks.\n\nYour goal is to find out the minimum possible number of flicks Moriarty will get (no one likes flicks) and the maximum possible number of flicks Sherlock can get from Moriarty. Note, that these two goals are different and the optimal result may be obtained by using different strategies.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of digits in the cards Sherlock and Moriarty are going to use.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ digits \u2014 Sherlock's credit card number.\n\nThe third line contains $ n $ digits \u2014 Moriarty's credit card number.",
    "outputFormat": "First print the minimum possible number of flicks Moriarty will get. Then print the maximum possible number of flicks that Sherlock can get from Moriarty.",
