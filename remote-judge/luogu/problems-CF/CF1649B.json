    "description": "Daniel is watching a football team playing a game during their training session. They want to improve their passing skills during that session.\n\nThe game involves $ n $ players, making multiple passes towards each other. Unfortunately, since the balls were moving too fast, after the session Daniel is unable to know how many balls were involved during the game. The only thing he knows is the number of passes delivered by each player during all the session.\n\nFind the minimum possible amount of balls that were involved in the game.",
    "inputFormat": "There are several test cases in the input data. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. This is followed by the test cases description.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of players.\n\nThe second line of the test case contains a sequence of integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9 $ ), where $ a_i $ is the number of passes delivered by the $ i $ -th player.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases doesn't exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
