    "description": "Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. $ n $ times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.\n\nYou are given $ n $ operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one positive integer $ n $ \u2014 the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 100 $ ).\n\nThe next line contains the string $ s $ , consisting of $ n $ symbols, equal to \"-\" (without quotes) or \"+\" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on $ i $ -th operation, $ s_i $ is equal to \"-\" (without quotes), if added, $ s_i $ is equal to \"+\" (without quotes).",

    "hint": "In the first test, if Vasya had $ 3 $ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $ 0 $ . It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is $ 0 $ . Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than $ 3 $ , because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).\n\nIn the second test, if Vasya had $ 0 $ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $ 4 $ . It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making $ 4 $ operations the number of stones in the pile increases on $ 4 $ stones. So, the answer is $ 4 $ .\n\nIn the third test, if Vasya had $ 1 $ stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $ 1 $ . It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.\n\nIn the fourth test, if Vasya had $ 0 $ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $ 3 $ .",
