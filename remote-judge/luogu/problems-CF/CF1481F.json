As a farewell gift, Kilani is going to challenge Abd with a problem written by their other neighbor with the same name Abd.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1481F/8cce3829ad0fff29931f8889a2e2e36a655644b6.png)The problem is:\n\nYou are given a connected tree rooted at node $ 1 $ .\n\nYou should assign a character a or b to every node in the tree so that the total number of a's is equal to $ x $ and the total number of b's is equal to $ n - x $ .\n\nLet's define a string for each node $ v $ of the tree as follows:\n\n- if $ v $ is root then the string is just one character assigned to $ v $ :\n- otherwise, let's take a string defined for the $ v $ 's parent $ p_v $ and add to the end of it a character assigned to $ v $ .\n\nYou should assign every node a character in a way that minimizes the number of distinct strings among the strings of all nodes.",
