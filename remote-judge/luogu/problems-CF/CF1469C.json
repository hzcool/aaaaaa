    "description": "You want to build a fence that will consist of $ n $ equal sections. All sections have a width equal to $ 1 $ and height equal to $ k $ . You will place all sections in one line side by side.\n\nUnfortunately, the ground beneath the fence is not flat. For simplicity, you can think that the ground level under the $ i $ -th section is equal to $ h_i $ .\n\nYou should follow several rules to build the fence:\n\n1. the consecutive sections should have a common side of length at least $ 1 $ ;\n2. the first and the last sections should stand on the corresponding ground levels;\n3. the sections between may be either on the ground level or higher, but not higher than $ k - 1 $ from the ground level $ h_i $ (the height should be an integer);\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1469C/639e8b11cbea2061b5e63469ccc4551e6fb009c3.png)One of possible fences (blue color) for the first test caseIs it possible to build a fence that meets all rules?",

According to the first rule, the second section should be on the height of at least $ 2 $ (to have a common side with the first section), but according to the third rule, the second section can be built on the height of at most $ h_2 + k - 1 = 1 $ .",
