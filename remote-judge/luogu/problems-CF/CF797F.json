    "description": "One day Masha came home and noticed $ n $ mice in the corridor of her flat. Of course, she shouted loudly, so scared mice started to run to the holes in the corridor.\n\nThe corridor can be represeted as a numeric axis with $ n $ mice and $ m $ holes on it. $ i $ th mouse is at the coordinate $ x_{i} $ , and $ j $ th hole \u2014 at coordinate $ p_{j} $ . $ j $ th hole has enough room for $ c_{j} $ mice, so not more than $ c_{j} $ mice can enter this hole.\n\nWhat is the minimum sum of distances that mice have to go through so that they all can hide in the holes? If $ i $ th mouse goes to the hole $ j $ , then its distance is $ |x_{i}-p_{j}| $ .\n\nPrint the minimum sum of distances.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integer numbers $ n $ , $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=5000 $ ) \u2014 the number of mice and the number of holes, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=x_{i}<=10^{9} $ ), where $ x_{i} $ is the coordinate of $ i $ th mouse.\n\nNext $ m $ lines contain pairs of integer numbers $ p_{j},c_{j} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=p_{j}<=10^{9},1<=c_{j}<=5000 $ ), where $ p_{j} $ is the coordinate of $ j $ th hole, and $ c_{j} $ is the maximum number of mice that can hide in the hole $ j $ .",
