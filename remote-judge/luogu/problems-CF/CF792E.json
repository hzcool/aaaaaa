You have to write a program that will divide all balls into sets such that:\n\n- each ball belongs to exactly one of the sets,\n- there are no empty sets,\n- there is no set containing two (or more) balls of different colors (each set contains only balls of one color),\n- there are no two sets such that the difference between their sizes is greater than $ 1 $ .\n\nPrint the minimum possible number of sets.",
