    "description": "This is an interactive problem!\n\nIn the last regional contest Hemose, ZeyadKhattab and YahiaSherif \u2014 members of the team Carpe Diem \u2014 did not qualify to ICPC because of some unknown reasons. Hemose was very sad and had a bad day after the contest, but ZeyadKhattab is very wise and knows Hemose very well, and does not want to see him sad.\n\nZeyad knows that Hemose loves tree problems, so he gave him a tree problem with a very special device.\n\nHemose has a weighted tree with $ n $ nodes and $ n-1 $ edges. Unfortunately, Hemose doesn't remember the weights of edges.\n\nLet's define $ Dist(u, v) $ for $ u\\neq v $ as the greatest common divisor of the weights of all edges on the path from node $ u $ to node $ v $ .\n\nHemose has a special device. Hemose can give the device a set of nodes, and the device will return the largest $ Dist $ between any two nodes from the set. More formally, if Hemose gives the device a set $ S $ of nodes, the device will return the largest value of $ Dist(u, v) $ over all pairs $ (u, v) $ with $ u $ , $ v $ $ \\in $ $ S $ and $ u \\neq v $ .\n\nHemose can use this Device at most $ 12 $ times, and wants to find any two distinct nodes $ a $ , $ b $ , such that $ Dist(a, b) $ is maximum possible. Can you help him?",

    "outputFormat": "Begin the interaction from reading a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 10^3 $ ) \u2014 the number of nodes in the tree.\n\nNext, read $ n-1 $ lines.\n\nThe $ i $ -th of the next $ n-1 $ lines contains two integers $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ ( $ 1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n $ , $ u_i\\neq v_i $ ), which means that there's an edge between nodes $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ .\n\nIt's guaranteed that weights of edges were $ \\leq 10^9 $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.\n\nNow you may begin asking queries. To ask a query about a set of $ k $ nodes $ v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k $ ( $ 2 \\le k \\le n $ , $ 1 \\le v_i \\le n $ , all $ v_i $ are distinct), output:\n\n ? $ k $ $ v_1 $ $ v_2 $ $ \\ldots $ $ v_k $\n\nYou will then receive an integer $ x $ , the largest $ Dist(v_i, v_j) $ over $ 1 \\le i, j \\le k $ with $ i \\neq j $ .\n\nWhen you have found $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1 \\le a, b \\le n) $ , $ a\\neq b $ ) such that $ Dist(a, b) $ is the maximum possible, print the answer in the following format:\n\n! $ a $ $ b $\n\nOutputting answer doesn't count towards the limit of $ 12 $ queries.\n\nIf there are several pairs $ (a, b) $ with the same largest $ Dist(a, b) $ , you can output any.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack a solution, use the following format.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $ n $ $ (2 \\leq n \\le 10^3) $ \u2014 the number of nodes.\n\nThe $ i $ -th of the next $ n-1 $ lines should contain three integers $ u_i $ , $ v_i $ , $ w_i $ ( $ 1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n $ , $ u_i\\ne v_i $ , $ 1 \\le w \\le 10^9 $ ), which means that there's an edge between nodes $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ with weight $ w_i $ .\n\nThese $ n-1 $ edges must form a tree.",
