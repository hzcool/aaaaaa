    "description": "Let's call two strings $ s $ and $ t $ anagrams of each other if it is possible to rearrange symbols in the string $ s $ to get a string, equal to $ t $ .\n\nLet's consider two strings $ s $ and $ t $ which are anagrams of each other. We say that $ t $ is a reducible anagram of $ s $ if there exists an integer $ k \\ge 2 $ and $ 2k $ non-empty strings $ s_1, t_1, s_2, t_2, \\dots, s_k, t_k $ that satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. If we write the strings $ s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k $ in order, the resulting string will be equal to $ s $ ;\n2. If we write the strings $ t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k $ in order, the resulting string will be equal to $ t $ ;\n3. For all integers $ i $ between $ 1 $ and $ k $ inclusive, $ s_i $ and $ t_i $ are anagrams of each other.\n\nIf such strings don't exist, then $ t $ is said to be an irreducible anagram of $ s $ . Note that these notions are only defined when $ s $ and $ t $ are anagrams of each other.\n\nFor example, consider the string $ s =  $ \"gamegame\". Then the string $ t =  $ \"megamage\" is a reducible anagram of $ s $ , we may choose for example $ s_1 =  $ \"game\", $ s_2 =  $ \"gam\", $ s_3 =  $ \"e\" and $ t_1 =  $ \"mega\", $ t_2 =  $ \"mag\", $ t_3 =  $ \"e\":\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1290B/c163083e3bbaacf9e28f6fddff5f78534bd4ddb9.png)On the other hand, we can prove that $ t =  $ \"memegaga\" is an irreducible anagram of $ s $ .\n\nYou will be given a string $ s $ and $ q $ queries, represented by two integers $ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le |s| $ (where $ |s| $ is equal to the length of the string $ s $ ). For each query, you should find if the substring of $ s $ formed by characters from the $ l $ -th to the $ r $ -th has at least one irreducible anagram.",
