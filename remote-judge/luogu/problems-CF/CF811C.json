    "description": "Vladik often travels by trains. He remembered some of his trips especially well and I would like to tell you about one of these trips:\n\nVladik is at initial train station, and now $ n $ people (including Vladik) want to get on the train. They are already lined up in some order, and for each of them the city code $ a_{i} $ is known (the code of the city in which they are going to).\n\nTrain chief selects some number of disjoint segments of the original sequence of people (covering entire sequence by segments is not necessary). People who are in the same segment will be in the same train carriage. The segments are selected in such way that if at least one person travels to the city $ x $ , then all people who are going to city $ x $ should be in the same railway carriage. This means that they can\u2019t belong to different segments. Note, that all people who travel to the city $ x $ , either go to it and in the same railway carriage, or do not go anywhere at all.\n\nComfort of a train trip with people on segment from position $ l $ to position $ r $ is equal to XOR of all distinct codes of cities for people on the segment from position $ l $ to position $ r $ . XOR operation also known as exclusive OR.\n\nTotal comfort of a train trip is equal to sum of comfort for each segment.\n\nHelp Vladik to know maximal possible total comfort.",
