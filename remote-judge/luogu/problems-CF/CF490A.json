Hence, for each child we know value $ t_{i} $ :\n\n- $ t_{i}=1 $ , if the $ i $ -th child is good at programming,\n- $ t_{i}=2 $ , if the $ i $ -th child is good at maths,\n- $ t_{i}=3 $ , if the $ i $ -th child is good at PE\n\nEach child happens to be good at exactly one of these three subjects.\n\nThe Team Scientific Decathlon Olympias requires teams of three students. The school teachers decided that the teams will be composed of three children that are good at different subjects. That is, each team must have one mathematician, one programmer and one sportsman. Of course, each child can be a member of no more than one team.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of teams that the school will be able to present at the Olympiad? How should the teams be formed for that?",

Each triple represents the indexes of the children forming the team. You can print both the teams, and the numbers in the triplets in any order. The children are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in the order of their appearance in the input. Each child must participate in no more than one team.
