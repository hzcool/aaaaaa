    "description": "Patrick likes to play baseball, but sometimes he will spend so many hours hitting home runs that his mind starts to get foggy! Patrick is sure that his scores across $ n $ sessions follow the identity permutation (ie. in the first game he scores $ 1 $ point, in the second game he scores $ 2 $ points and so on). However, when he checks back to his record, he sees that all the numbers are mixed up!\n\nDefine a special exchange as the following: choose any subarray of the scores and permute elements such that no element of subarray gets to the same position as it was before the exchange. For example, performing a special exchange on $ [1,2,3] $ can yield $ [3,1,2] $ but it cannot yield $ [3,2,1] $ since the $ 2 $ is in the same position.\n\nGiven a permutation of $ n $ integers, please help Patrick find the minimum number of special exchanges needed to make the permutation sorted! It can be proved that under given constraints this number doesn't exceed $ 10^{18} $ .\n\nAn array $ a $ is a subarray of an array $ b $ if $ a $ can be obtained from $ b $ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.",
