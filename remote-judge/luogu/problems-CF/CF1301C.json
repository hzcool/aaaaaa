    "description": "Ayoub thinks that he is a very smart person, so he created a function $ f(s) $ , where $ s $ is a binary string (a string which contains only symbols \"0\" and \"1\"). The function $ f(s) $ is equal to the number of substrings in the string $ s $ that contains at least one symbol, that is equal to \"1\".\n\nMore formally, $ f(s) $ is equal to the number of pairs of integers $ (l, r) $ , such that $ 1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq |s| $ (where $ |s| $ is equal to the length of string $ s $ ), such that at least one of the symbols $ s_l, s_{l+1}, \\ldots, s_r $ is equal to \"1\".\n\nFor example, if $ s =  $ \"01010\" then $ f(s) = 12 $ , because there are $ 12 $ such pairs $ (l, r) $ : $ (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 5) $ .\n\nAyoub also thinks that he is smarter than Mahmoud so he gave him two integers $ n $ and $ m $ and asked him this problem. For all binary strings $ s $ of length $ n $ which contains exactly $ m $ symbols equal to \"1\", find the maximum value of $ f(s) $ .\n\nMahmoud couldn't solve the problem so he asked you for help. Can you help him?",

    "hint": "In the first test case, there exists only $ 3 $ strings of length $ 3 $ , which has exactly $ 1 $ symbol, equal to \"1\". These strings are: $ s_1 =  $ \"100\", $ s_2 =  $ \"010\", $ s_3 =  $ \"001\". The values of $ f $ for them are: $ f(s_1) = 3, f(s_2) = 4, f(s_3) = 3 $ , so the maximum value is $ 4 $ and the answer is $ 4 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, the string $ s $ with the maximum value is \"101\".\n\nIn the third test case, the string $ s $ with the maximum value is \"111\".\n\nIn the fourth test case, the only string $ s $ of length $ 4 $ , which has exactly $ 0 $ symbols, equal to \"1\" is \"0000\" and the value of $ f $ for that string is $ 0 $ , so the answer is $ 0 $ .\n\nIn the fifth test case, the string $ s $ with the maximum value is \"01010\" and it is described as an example in the problem statement.",
