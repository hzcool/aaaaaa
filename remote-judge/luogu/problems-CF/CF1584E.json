    "description": "Bob decided to take a break from calculus homework and designed a game for himself.\n\nThe game is played on a sequence of piles of stones, which can be described with a sequence of integers $ s_1, \\ldots, s_k $ , where $ s_i $ is the number of stones in the $ i $ -th pile. On each turn, Bob picks a pair of non-empty adjacent piles $ i $ and $ i+1 $ and takes one stone from each. If a pile becomes empty, its adjacent piles do not become adjacent. The game ends when Bob can't make turns anymore. Bob considers himself a winner if at the end all piles are empty.\n\nWe consider a sequence of piles winning if Bob can start with it and win with some sequence of moves.\n\nYou are given a sequence $ a_1, \\ldots, a_n $ , count the number of subsegments of $ a $ that describe a winning sequence of piles. In other words find the number of segments $ [l, r] $ ( $ 1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n $ ), such that the sequence $ a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r $ is winning.",
