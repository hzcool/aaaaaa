    "description": "All modern mobile applications are divided into free and paid. Even a single application developers often release two versions: a paid version without ads and a free version with ads.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF436F/c46aedeefaad64d2bb027e2acfd0cd5cd5b8a0fc.png)Suppose that a paid version of the app costs $ p $ ( $ p $ is an integer) rubles, and the free version of the application contains $ c $ ad banners. Each user can be described by two integers: $ a_{i} $ \u2014 the number of rubles this user is willing to pay for the paid version of the application, and $ b_{i} $ \u2014 the number of banners he is willing to tolerate in the free version.\n\nThe behavior of each member shall be considered strictly deterministic:\n\n- if for user $ i $ , value $ b_{i} $ is at least $ c $ , then he uses the free version,\n- otherwise, if value $ a_{i} $ is at least $ p $ , then he buys the paid version without advertising,\n- otherwise the user simply does not use the application.\n\nEach user of the free version brings the profit of $ c\u00d7w $ rubles. Each user of the paid version brings the profit of $ p $ rubles.\n\nYour task is to help the application developers to select the optimal parameters $ p $ and $ c $ . Namely, knowing all the characteristics of users, for each value of $ c $ from $ 0 $ to $ (max\u00a0b_{i})+1 $ you need to determine the maximum profit from the application and the corresponding parameter $ p $ .",

Each of the next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ $ (0<=a_{i},b_{i}<=10^{5}) $ \u2014 the characteristics of the $ i $ -th user.",
