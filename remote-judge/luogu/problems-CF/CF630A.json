The last applicant failed the interview the same way as 24 previous ones. \"Do I give such a hard task?\" \u2014 the HR manager thought. \"Just raise number $ 5 $ to the power of $ n $ and get last two digits of the number. Yes, of course, $ n $ can be rather big, and one cannot find the power using a calculator, but we need people who are able to think, not just follow the instructions.\"\n\nCould you pass the interview in the machine vision company in IT City?",
