    "description": "A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.\n\nYour favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of $ n $ different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type $ i $ has volume $ 2^{i-1} $ liters and costs $ c_{i} $ roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.\n\nYou want to buy at least $ L $ liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ L $ ( $ 1<=n<=30 $ ; $ 1<=L<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n} $ ( $ 1<=c_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the costs of bottles of different types.",

In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.\n\nIn the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.\n\nIn the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.",
