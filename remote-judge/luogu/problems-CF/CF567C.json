    "description": "Polycarp loves geometric progressions very much. Since he was only three years old, he loves only the progressions of length three. He also has a favorite integer $ k $ and a sequence $ a $ , consisting of $ n $ integers.\n\nHe wants to know how many subsequences of length three can be selected from $ a $ , so that they form a geometric progression with common ratio $ k $ .\n\nA subsequence of length three is a combination of three such indexes $ i_{1},i_{2},i_{3} $ , that $ 1<=i_{1}&lt;i_{2}&lt;i_{3}<=n $ . That is, a subsequence of length three are such groups of three elements that are not necessarily consecutive in the sequence, but their indexes are strictly increasing.\n\nA geometric progression with common ratio $ k $ is a sequence of numbers of the form $ b\u00b7k^{0},b\u00b7k^{1},...,b\u00b7k^{r-1} $ .\n\nPolycarp is only three years old, so he can not calculate this number himself. Help him to do it.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers, $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,k<=2\u00b710^{5} $ ), showing how many numbers Polycarp's sequence has and his favorite number.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 elements of the sequence.",
    "outputFormat": "Output a single number \u2014 the number of ways to choose a subsequence of length three, such that it forms a geometric progression with a common ratio $ k $ .",
