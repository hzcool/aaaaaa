In the museum, $ n $ exhibits (numbered $ 1 $ through $ n $ ) had been displayed for a long time; the $ i $ -th of those exhibits has value $ v_{i} $ and mass $ w_{i} $ .\n\nThen, the museum was bought by a large financial group and started to vary the exhibits. At about the same time, Kleof\u00e1\u0161... gained interest in the museum, so to say.\n\nYou should process $ q $ events of three types:\n\n- type $ 1 $ \u2014 the museum displays an exhibit with value $ v $ and mass $ w $ ; the exhibit displayed in the $ i $ -th event of this type is numbered $ n+i $ (see sample explanation for more details)\n- type $ 2 $ \u2014 the museum removes the exhibit with number $ x $ and stores it safely in its vault\n- type $ 3 $ \u2014 Kleof\u00e1\u0161 visits the museum and wonders (for no important reason at all, of course): if there was a robbery and exhibits with total mass at most $ m $ were stolen, what would their maximum possible total value be?\n\nFor each event of type 3, let $ s(m) $ be the maximum possible total value of stolen exhibits with total mass $ <=m $ .\n\nFormally, let $ D $ be the set of numbers of all exhibits that are currently displayed (so initially $ D $ = {1, ..., n}).
