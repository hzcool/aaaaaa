    "description": "You are given two integers $ x $ and $ y $ . You want to choose two strictly positive (greater than zero) integers $ a $ and $ b $ , and then apply the following operation to $ x $ exactly $ a $ times: replace $ x $ with $ b \\cdot x $ .\n\nYou want to find two positive integers $ a $ and $ b $ such that $ x $ becomes equal to $ y $ after this process. If there are multiple possible pairs, you can choose any of them. If there is no such pair, report it.\n\nFor example:\n\n- if $ x = 3 $ and $ y = 75 $ , you may choose $ a = 2 $ and $ b = 5 $ , so that $ x $ becomes equal to $ 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 = 75 $ ;\n- if $ x = 100 $ and $ y = 100 $ , you may choose $ a = 3 $ and $ b = 1 $ , so that $ x $ becomes equal to $ 100 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 100 $ ;\n- if $ x = 42 $ and $ y = 13 $ , there is no answer since you cannot decrease $ x $ with the given operations.",

The integers you print should be not less than $ 1 $ and not greater than $ 10^9 $  (it can be shown that if the answer exists, there is a pair of integers $ a $ and $ b $ meeting these constraints).
