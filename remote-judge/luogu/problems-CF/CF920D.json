    "description": "Petya sometimes has to water his field. To water the field, Petya needs a tank with exactly $ V $ ml of water.\n\nPetya has got $ N $ tanks, $ i $ -th of them initially containing $ a_{i} $ ml of water. The tanks are really large, any of them can contain any amount of water (no matter how large this amount is).\n\nAlso Petya has got a scoop that can contain up to $ K $ ml of water (initially the scoop is empty). This scoop can be used to get some water from some tank, and after that pour it all into some other tank (it is impossible to get water from multiple tanks without pouring it, or leave some water in the scoop when pouring it). When Petya tries to get some water from a tank, he gets $ min(v,K) $ water, where $ v $ is the current volume of water in the tank.\n\nIs it possible to obtain a tank with exactly $ V $ ml of water using these operations? If it is possible, print a sequence of operations that allows to do it. If there are multiple ways to obtain needed amount of water in some tank, print any of them.",
