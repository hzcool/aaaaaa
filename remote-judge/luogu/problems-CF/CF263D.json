    "description": "You've got a undirected graph $ G $ , consisting of $ n $ nodes. We will consider the nodes of the graph indexed by integers from 1 to $ n $ . We know that each node of graph $ G $ is connected by edges with at least $ k $ other nodes of this graph. Your task is to find in the given graph a simple cycle of length of at least $ k+1 $ .\n\nA simple cycle of length $ d $ $ (d&gt;1) $ in graph $ G $ is a sequence of distinct graph nodes $ v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{d} $ such, that nodes $ v_{1} $ and $ v_{d} $ are connected by an edge of the graph, also for any integer $ i $ $ (1<=i&lt;d) $ nodes $ v_{i} $ and $ v_{i+1} $ are connected by an edge of the graph.",
