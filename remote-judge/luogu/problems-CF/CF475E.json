    "description": "Imagine a city with $ n $ junctions and $ m $ streets. Junctions are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .\n\nIn order to increase the traffic flow, mayor of the city has decided to make each street one-way. This means in the street between junctions $ u $ and $ v $ , the traffic moves only from $ u $ to $ v $ or only from $ v $ to $ u $ .\n\nThe problem is to direct the traffic flow of streets in a way that maximizes the number of pairs $ (u,v) $ where $ 1<=u,v<=n $ and it is possible to reach junction $ v $ from $ u $ by passing the streets in their specified direction. Your task is to find out maximal possible number of such pairs.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains integers $ n $ and $ m $ , (![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF475E/05db91a084cfb5bf0fdc25594d21f636925d7afa.png)), denoting the number of junctions and streets of the city.\n\nEach of the following $ m $ lines contains two integers $ u $ and $ v $ , ( $ u\u2260v $ ), denoting endpoints of a street in the city.\n\nBetween every two junctions there will be at most one street. It is guaranteed that before mayor decision (when all streets were two-way) it was possible to reach each junction from any other junction.",
