The first tank has $ c $ ( $ 0 \\le c \\le a $ ) liters of water initially, the second tank has $ d $ ( $ 0 \\le d \\le b $ ) liters of water initially.\n\nYou want to perform $ n $ operations on them. The $ i $ -th operation is specified by a single non-zero integer $ v_i $ . If $ v_i > 0 $ , then you try to pour $ v_i $ liters of water from the first tank into the second one. If $ v_i < 0 $ , you try to pour $ -v_i $ liters of water from the second tank to the first one.\n\nWhen you try to pour $ x $ liters of water from the tank that has $ y $ liters currently available to the tank that can fit $ z $ more liters of water, the operation only moves $ \\min(x, y, z) $ liters of water.\n\nFor all pairs of the initial volumes of water $ (c, d) $ such that $ 0 \\le c \\le a $ and $ 0 \\le d \\le b $ , calculate the volume of water in the first tank after all operations are performed.",

Thus, $ \\min(2, 2, 1) = 1 $ liter is moved, the first tank now contains $ 4 $ liters, the second tank now contains $ 1 $ liter.\n- The second operation tries to move $ 1 $ liter of water from the first tank to the second one. $ \\min(1, 4, 3) = 1 $ liter is moved, the first tank now contains $ 3 $ liters, the second tank now contains $ 2 $ liter.\n- The third operation tries to move $ 2 $ liter of water from the first tank to the second one. $ \\min(2, 3, 2) = 2 $ liters are moved, the first tank now contains $ 1 $ liter, the second tank now contains $ 4 $ liters.\n\nThere's $ 1 $ liter of water in the first tank at the end.
