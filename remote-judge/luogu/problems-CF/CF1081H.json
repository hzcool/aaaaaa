    "description": "After learning some fancy algorithms about palindromes, Chouti found palindromes very interesting, so he wants to challenge you with this problem.\n\nChouti has got two strings $ A $ and $ B $ . Since he likes [palindromes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome), he would like to pick $ a $ as some non-empty palindromic substring of $ A $ and $ b $ as some non-empty palindromic substring of $ B $ . Concatenating them, he will get string $ ab $ .\n\nChouti thinks strings he could get this way are interesting, so he wants to know how many different strings he can get.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single string $ A $ ( $ 1 \\le |A| \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ).\n\nThe second line contains a single string $ B $ ( $ 1 \\le |B| \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ).\n\nStrings $ A $ and $ B $ contain only lowercase English letters.",
    "outputFormat": "The first and only line should contain a single integer \u2014 the number of possible strings.",
