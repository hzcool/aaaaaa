    "description": "There are $ n $ points on the plane, the $ i $ -th of which is at $ (x_i, y_i) $ . Tokitsukaze wants to draw a strange rectangular area and pick all the points in the area.\n\nThe strange area is enclosed by three lines, $ x = l $ , $ y = a $ and $ x = r $ , as its left side, its bottom side and its right side respectively, where $ l $ , $ r $ and $ a $ can be any real numbers satisfying that $ l < r $ . The upper side of the area is boundless, which you can regard as a line parallel to the $ x $ -axis at infinity. The following figure shows a strange rectangular area.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1190D/61dd515911e657abcecc735a28955cca0cecb620.png)A point $ (x_i, y_i) $ is in the strange rectangular area if and only if $ l < x_i < r $ and $ y_i > a $ . For example, in the above figure, $ p_1 $ is in the area while $ p_2 $ is not.\n\nTokitsukaze wants to know how many different non-empty sets she can obtain by picking all the points in a strange rectangular area, where we think two sets are different if there exists at least one point in one set of them but not in the other.",
