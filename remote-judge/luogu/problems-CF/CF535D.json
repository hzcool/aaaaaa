    "description": "Tavas is a strange creature. Usually \"zzz\" comes out of people's mouth while sleeping, but string $ s $ of length $ n $ comes out from Tavas' mouth instead.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF535D/edec2eae8d180d77009c457fa18d1007b3d9ea05.png)Today Tavas fell asleep in Malekas' place. While he was sleeping, Malekas did a little process on $ s $ . Malekas has a favorite string $ p $ . He determined all positions $ x_{1}&lt;x_{2}&lt;...&lt;x_{k} $ where $ p $ matches $ s $ . More formally, for each $ x_{i} $ ( $ 1<=i<=k $ ) he condition $ s_{xi}s_{xi}+1...\\ s_{xi}+|p|-1=p $ is fullfilled.\n\nThen Malekas wrote down one of subsequences of $ x_{1},x_{2},...\\ x_{k} $ (possibly, he didn't write anything) on a piece of paper. Here a sequence $ b $ is a subsequence of sequence $ a $ if and only if we can turn $ a $ into $ b $ by removing some of its elements (maybe no one of them or all).\n\nAfter Tavas woke up, Malekas told him everything. He couldn't remember string $ s $ , but he knew that both $ p $ and $ s $ only contains lowercase English letters and also he had the subsequence he had written on that piece of paper.\n\nTavas wonders, what is the number of possible values of $ s $ ? He asked SaDDas, but he wasn't smart enough to solve this. So, Tavas asked you to calculate this number for him.\n\nAnswer can be very large, so Tavas wants you to print the answer modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .",
