    "description": "We call a positive integer number fair if it is divisible by each of its nonzero digits. For example, $ 102 $ is fair (because it is divisible by $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ ), but $ 282 $ is not, because it isn't divisible by $ 8 $ . Given a positive integer $ n $ . Find the minimum integer $ x $ , such that $ n \\leq x $ and $ x $ is fair.",
