    "description": "You are given a tree (connected graph without cycles) consisting of $ n $ vertices. The tree is unrooted \u2014 it is just a connected undirected graph without cycles.\n\nIn one move, you can choose exactly $ k $ leaves (leaf is such a vertex that is connected to only one another vertex) connected to the same vertex and remove them with edges incident to them. I.e. you choose such leaves $ u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_k $ that there are edges $ (u_1,       v) $ , $ (u_2, v) $ , $ \\dots $ , $ (u_k, v) $ and remove these leaves and these edges.\n\nYour task is to find the maximum number of moves you can perform if you remove leaves optimally.\n\nYou have to answer $ t $ independent test cases.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1       \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ; $ 1 \\le k < n $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree and the number of leaves you remove in one move, respectively. The next $ n-1 $ lines describe edges. The $ i $ -th edge is represented as two integers $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ ( $ 1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n $ ), where $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ are vertices the $ i $ -th edge connects. It is guaranteed that the given set of edges forms a tree.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ does not exceed $ 2       \\cdot 10^5 $ ( $ \\sum n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ).",
