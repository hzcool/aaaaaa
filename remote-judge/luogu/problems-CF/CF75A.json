    "description": "Can you imagine our life if we removed all zeros from it? For sure we will have many problems.\n\nIn this problem we will have a simple example if we removed all zeros from our life, it's the addition operation. Let's assume you are given this equation $ a+b=c $ , where $ a $ and $ b $ are positive integers, and $ c $ is the sum of $ a $ and $ b $ . Now let's remove all zeros from this equation. Will the equation remain correct after removing all zeros?\n\nFor example if the equation is $ 101+102=203 $ , if we removed all zeros it will be $ 11+12=23 $ which is still a correct equation.\n\nBut if the equation is $ 105+106=211 $ , if we removed all zeros it will be $ 15+16=211 $ which is not a correct equation.",
    "inputFormat": "The input will consist of two lines, the first line will contain the integer $ a $ , and the second line will contain the integer $ b $ which are in the equation as described above ( $ 1<=a,b<=10^{9} $ ). There won't be any leading zeros in both. The value of $ c $ should be calculated as $ c=a+b $ .",
    "outputFormat": "The output will be just one line, you should print \"YES\" if the equation will remain correct after removing all zeros, and print \"NO\" otherwise.",
