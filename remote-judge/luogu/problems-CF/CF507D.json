    "description": "Amr doesn't like Maths as he finds it really boring, so he usually sleeps in Maths lectures. But one day the teacher suspected that Amr is sleeping and asked him a question to make sure he wasn't.\n\nFirst he gave Amr two positive integers $ n $ and $ k $ . Then he asked Amr, how many integer numbers $ x&gt;0 $ exist such that:\n\n- Decimal representation of $ x $ (without leading zeroes) consists of exactly $ n $ digits;\n- There exists some integer $ y&gt;0 $ such that: \n  - ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF507D/a168a0f3214943d3090a4c18ee0075fe3a3849dd.png);\n  - decimal representation of $ y $ is a suffix of decimal representation of $ x $ .\n\nAs the answer to this question may be pretty huge the teacher asked Amr to output only its remainder modulo a number $ m $ .\n\nCan you help Amr escape this embarrassing situation?",
