    "description": "Igor the analyst has adopted $ n $ little bunnies. As we all know, bunnies love carrots. Thus, Igor has bought a carrot to be shared between his bunnies. Igor wants to treat all the bunnies equally, and thus he wants to cut the carrot into $ n $ pieces of equal area.\n\nFormally, the carrot can be viewed as an isosceles triangle with base length equal to $ 1 $ and height equal to $ h $ . Igor wants to make $ n-1 $ cuts parallel to the base to cut the carrot into $ n $ pieces. He wants to make sure that all $ n $ pieces have the same area. Can you help Igor determine where to cut the carrot so that each piece have equal area?\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF794B/e0a493727cae2e59335accfa3d0c200bda3f1ec1.png)Illustration to the first example.",

In addition, $ 0&lt;x_{1}&lt;x_{2}&lt;...&lt;x_{n-1}&lt;h $ must hold.\n\nYour output will be considered correct if absolute or relative error of every number in your output doesn't exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .\n\nFormally, let your answer be $ a $ , and the jury's answer be $ b $ .
