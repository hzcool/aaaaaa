    "description": "In Aramic language words can only represent objects.\n\nWords in Aramic have special properties:\n\n- A word is a root if it does not contain the same letter more than once.\n- A root and all its permutations represent the same object.\n- The root $ x $ of a word $ y $ is the word that contains all letters that appear in $ y $ in a way that each letter appears once. For example, the root of \"aaaa\", \"aa\", \"aaa\" is \"a\", the root of \"aabb\", \"bab\", \"baabb\", \"ab\" is \"ab\".\n- Any word in Aramic represents the same object as its root.\n\nYou have an ancient script in Aramic. What is the number of different objects mentioned in the script?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^3 $ ) \u2014 the number of words in the script.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ words $ s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n $ \u2014 the script itself. The length of each string does not exceed $ 10^3 $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that all characters of the strings are small latin letters.",
    "outputFormat": "Output one integer \u2014 the number of different objects mentioned in the given ancient Aramic script.",

    "hint": "In the first test, there are two objects mentioned. The roots that represent them are \"a\",\"ab\".\n\nIn the second test, there is only one object, its root is \"amer\", the other strings are just permutations of \"amer\"."
