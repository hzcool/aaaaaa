    "description": "Julia is going to cook a chicken in the kitchen of her dormitory. To save energy, the stove in the kitchen automatically turns off after $ k $ minutes after turning on.\n\nDuring cooking, Julia goes to the kitchen every $ d $ minutes and turns on the stove if it is turned off. While the cooker is turned off, it stays warm. The stove switches on and off instantly.\n\nIt is known that the chicken needs $ t $ minutes to be cooked on the stove, if it is turned on, and $ 2t $ minutes, if it is turned off. You need to find out, how much time will Julia have to cook the chicken, if it is considered that the chicken is cooked evenly, with constant speed when the stove is turned on and at a constant speed when it is turned off.",
