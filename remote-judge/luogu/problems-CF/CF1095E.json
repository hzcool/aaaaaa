    "description": "You are given a bracket sequence $ s $ consisting of $ n $ opening '(' and closing ')' brackets.\n\nA regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters '1' and '+' between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences \"()()\", \"(())\" are regular (the resulting expressions are: \"(1)+(1)\", \"((1+1)+1)\"), and \")(\" and \"(\" are not.\n\nYou can change the type of some bracket $ s_i $ . It means that if $ s_i =  $ ')' then you can change it to '(' and vice versa.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of positions $ i $ such that if you change the type of the $ i $ -th bracket, then the resulting bracket sequence becomes regular.",
