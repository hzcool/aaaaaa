Luba wants to finish reading as fast as she can.\n\nBut she has some work to do in each of $ n $ next days. The number of seconds that Luba has to spend working during $ i $ -th day is $ a_{i} $ . If some free time remains, she can spend it on reading.\n\nHelp Luba to determine the minimum number of day when she finishes reading.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the answer doesn't exceed $ n $ .\n\nRemember that there are 86400 seconds in a day.",
