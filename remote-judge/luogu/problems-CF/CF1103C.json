    "description": "Today is tuesday, that means there is a dispute in JOHNNY SOLVING team again: they try to understand who is Johnny and who is Solving. That's why guys asked Umnik to help them. Umnik gave guys a connected graph with $ n $ vertices without loops and multiedges, such that a degree of any vertex is at least $ 3 $ , and also he gave a number $ 1 \\leq k \\leq n $ . Because Johnny is not too smart, he promised to find a simple path with length at least $ \\frac{n}{k} $ in the graph. In reply, Solving promised to find $ k $ simple by vertices cycles with representatives, such that:\n\n- Length of each cycle is at least $ 3 $ .\n- Length of each cycle is not divisible by $ 3 $ .\n- In each cycle must be a representative - vertex, which belongs only to this cycle among all printed cycles.\n\nYou need to help guys resolve the dispute, for that you need to find a solution for Johnny: a simple path with length at least $ \\frac{n}{k} $ ( $ n $ is not necessarily divided by $ k $ ), or solution for Solving: $ k $ cycles that satisfy all the conditions above. If there is no any solution - print $ -1 $ .",

In the following lines describe exactly $ k $ cycles in the following format: in the first line print the size of the cycle $ c $ ( $ c \\geq 3 $ ). In the second line print the cycle in route order. Also, the first vertex in the cycle must be a representative.\n\nPrint $ -1 $ if there is no any solution. The total amount of printed numbers in the output must be at most $ 10^6 $ .
