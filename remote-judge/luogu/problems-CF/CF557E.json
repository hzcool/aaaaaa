    "description": "Tomorrow Ann takes the hardest exam of programming where she should get an excellent mark.\n\nOn the last theoretical class the teacher introduced the notion of a half-palindrome.\n\nString $ t $ is a half-palindrome, if for all the odd positions $ i $ (![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF557E/e09f17f23488b7cc1450a3fdab11115b8478958b.png)) the following condition is held: $ t_{i}=t_{|t|-i+1} $ , where $ |t| $ is the length of string $ t $ if positions are indexed from $ 1 $ . For example, strings \"abaa\", \"a\", \"bb\", \"abbbaa\" are half-palindromes and strings \"ab\", \"bba\" and \"aaabaa\" are not.\n\nAnn knows that on the exam she will get string $ s $ , consisting only of letters a and b, and number $ k $ . To get an excellent mark she has to find the $ k $ -th in the lexicographical order string among all substrings of $ s $ that are half-palyndromes. Note that each substring in this order is considered as many times as many times it occurs in $ s $ .\n\nThe teachers guarantees that the given number $ k $ doesn't exceed the number of substrings of the given string that are half-palindromes.\n\nCan you cope with this problem?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains string $ s $ ( $ 1<=|s|<=5000 $ ), consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b', where $ |s| $ is the length of string $ s $ .\n\nThe second line contains a positive integer $ k $ \u2014 the lexicographical number of the requested string among all the half-palindrome substrings of the given string $ s $ . The strings are numbered starting from one.\n\nIt is guaranteed that number $ k $ doesn't exceed the number of substrings of the given string that are half-palindromes.",
