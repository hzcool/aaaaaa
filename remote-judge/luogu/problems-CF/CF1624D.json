    "description": "You have a string $ s $ consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters.\n\nYou can color some letters in colors from $ 1 $ to $ k $ . It is not necessary to paint all the letters. But for each color, there must be a letter painted in that color.\n\nThen you can swap any two symbols painted in the same color as many times as you want.\n\nAfter that, $ k $ strings will be created, $ i $ -th of them will contain all the characters colored in the color $ i $ , written in the order of their sequence in the string $ s $ .\n\nYour task is to color the characters of the string so that all the resulting $ k $ strings are palindromes, and the length of the shortest of these $ k $ strings is as large as possible.\n\nRead the note for the first test case of the example if you need a clarification.\n\nRecall that a string is a palindrome if it reads the same way both from left to right and from right to left. For example, the strings abacaba, cccc, z and dxd are palindromes, but the strings abab and aaabaa \u2014 are not.",

The second line of the description of each input data set contains a string $ s $ of length $ n $ consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",

    "hint": "- In the first test case, $ s $ =\"bxyaxzay\", $ k=2 $ . We use indices in the string from $ 1 $ to $ 8 $ . The following coloring will work: $ \\mathtt{\\mathbf{\\color{red}{b}\\color{blue}{xy}\\color{red}{a}\\color{blue}{x}z\\color{red}{a}\\color{blue}{y}}} $ (the letter z remained uncolored). After painting:\n  - swap two red characters (with the indices $ 1 $ and $ 4 $ ), we get $ \\mathtt{\\mathbf{\\color{red}{a}\\color{blue}{xy}\\color{red}{b}\\color{blue}{x}z\\color{red}{a}\\color{blue}{y}}} $ ;\n  - swap two blue characters (with the indices $ 5 $ and $ 8 $ ), we get $ \\mathtt{\\mathbf{\\color{red}{a}\\color{blue}{xy}\\color{red}{b}\\color{blue}{y}z\\color{red}{a}\\color{blue}{x}}} $ .\n  \n  Now, for each of the two colors we write out the corresponding characters from left to right, we get two strings $ \\mathtt{\\mathbf{\\color{red}{aba}}} $ and $ \\mathtt{\\mathbf{\\color{blue}{xyyx}}} $ . Both of them are palindromes, the length of the shortest is $ 3 $ . It can be shown that the greatest length of the shortest palindrome cannot be achieved.\n- In the second set of input data, the following coloring is suitable: $ [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3] $ . There is no need to swap characters. Both received strings are equal to aa, they are palindromes and their length is $ 2 $ .\n- In the third set of input data, you can color any character and take it into a string.\n- In the fourth set of input data, you can color the $ i $ th character in the color $ i $ .\n- In the fifth set of input data can be colored in each of the colors of one character.\n- In the sixth set of input data, the following coloring is suitable: $ [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0] $ . Rearrange the characters so as to get the palindromes abcba and acbca.",
