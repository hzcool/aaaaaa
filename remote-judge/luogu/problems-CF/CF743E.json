    "description": "Vladik was bored on his way home and decided to play the following game. He took $ n $ cards and put them in a row in front of himself. Every card has a positive integer number not exceeding $ 8 $ written on it. He decided to find the longest subsequence of cards which satisfies the following conditions:\n\n- the number of occurrences of each number from $ 1 $ to $ 8 $ in the subsequence doesn't differ by more then $ 1 $ from the number of occurrences of any other number. Formally, if there are $ c_{k} $ cards with number $ k $ on them in the subsequence, than for all pairs of integers ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF743E/0c6cc5f621659ae2ddf5ab0dac10dd28e326ec14.png) the condition $ |c_{i}-c_{j}|<=1 $ must hold.\n- if there is at least one card with number $ x $ on it in the subsequence, then all cards with number $ x $ in this subsequence must form a continuous segment in it (but not necessarily a continuous segment in the original sequence). For example, the subsequence $ [1,1,2,2] $ satisfies this condition while the subsequence $ [1,2,2,1] $ doesn't. Note that $ [1,1,2,2] $ doesn't satisfy the first condition.\n\nPlease help Vladik to find the length of the longest subsequence that satisfies both conditions.",
