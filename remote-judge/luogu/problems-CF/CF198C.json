    "description": "Qwerty the Ranger arrived to the Diatar system with a very important task. He should deliver a special carcinogen for scientific research to planet Persephone. This is urgent, so Qwerty has to get to the planet as soon as possible. A lost day may fail negotiations as nobody is going to pay for an overdue carcinogen.\n\nYou can consider Qwerty's ship, the planet Persephone and the star Diatar points on a plane. Diatar is located in the origin of coordinate axes \u2014 at point $ (0,0) $ . Persephone goes round Diatar along a circular orbit with radius $ R $ in the counter-clockwise direction at constant linear speed $ v_{p} $ (thus, for instance, a full circle around the star takes ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF198C/7f71d7fc5fa093338f75a2945295efbc06437170.png) of time). At the initial moment of time Persephone is located at point $ (x_{p},y_{p}) $ .\n\nAt the initial moment of time Qwerty's ship is at point $ (x,y) $ . Qwerty can move in any direction at speed of at most $ v $ ( $ v&gt;v_{p} $ ). The star Diatar is hot (as all stars), so Qwerty can't get too close to it. The ship's metal sheathing melts at distance $ r $ ( $ r&lt;R $ ) from the star.\n\nFind the minimum time Qwerty needs to get the carcinogen to planet Persephone.",
