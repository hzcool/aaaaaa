    "description": "There are $ n $ houses in your city arranged on an axis at points $ h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_n $ . You want to build a new house for yourself and consider two options where to place it: points $ p_1 $ and $ p_2 $ .\n\nAs you like visiting friends, you have calculated in advance the distances from both options to all existing houses. More formally, you have calculated two arrays $ d_1 $ , $ d_2 $ : $ d_{i, j} = \\left|p_i - h_j\\right| $ , where $ |x| $ defines the absolute value of $ x $ .\n\nAfter a long time of inactivity you have forgotten the locations of the houses $ h $ and the options $ p_1 $ , $ p_2 $ . But your diary still keeps two arrays \u2014 $ d_1 $ , $ d_2 $ , whose authenticity you doubt. Also, the values inside each array could be shuffled, so values at the same positions of $ d_1 $ and $ d_2 $ may correspond to different houses. Pay attention, that values from one array could not get to another, in other words, all values in the array $ d_1 $ correspond the distances from $ p_1 $ to the houses, and in the array $ d_2 $ \u2014 from $ p_2 $ to the houses.\n\nAlso pay attention, that the locations of the houses $ h_i $ and the considered options $ p_j $ could match. For example, the next locations are correct: $ h = \\{1, 0, 3, 3\\} $ , $ p = \\{1, 1\\} $ , that could correspond to already shuffled $ d_1 = \\{0, 2, 1, 2\\} $ , $ d_2 = \\{2, 2, 1, 0\\} $ .\n\nCheck whether there are locations of houses $ h $ and considered points $ p_1 $ , $ p_2 $ , for which the founded arrays of distances would be correct. If it is possible, find appropriate locations of houses and considered options.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^3 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 10^3 $ ) \u2014 the length of arrays $ d_1 $ , $ d_2 $ .\n\nThe next two lines contain $ n $ integers each: arrays $ d_1 $ and $ d_2 $ ( $ 0 \\le d_{i, j} \\le 10^9 $ ) respectively.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases doesn't exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^3 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line \"NO\" if there is no answer.\n\nOtherwise output three lines. The first line must contain \"YES\". In the second line, print $ n $ integers $ h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_n $ . In the third line print two integers $ p_1 $ , $ p_2 $ .\n\nIt must be satisfied that $ 0 \\le h_i, p_1, p_2 \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9 $ . We can show that if there is an answer, then there is one satisfying these constraints.\n\nIf there are several answers, output any of them.",
