    "description": "Given an undirected connected graph with $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges. The graph contains no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and multiple edges (i.e. no more than one edge between each pair of vertices). The vertices of the graph are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .\n\nFind the number of paths from a vertex $ s $ to $ t $ whose length differs from the shortest path from $ s $ to $ t $ by no more than $ 1 $ . It is necessary to consider all suitable paths, even if they pass through the same vertex or edge more than once (i.e. they are not simple).\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1650G/3360dade3a147f98c6dd4b25980520a2ae6123a6.png)Graph consisting of $ 6 $ of vertices and $ 8 $ of edgesFor example, let $ n = 6 $ , $ m = 8 $ , $ s = 6 $ and $ t = 1 $ , and let the graph look like the figure above.
