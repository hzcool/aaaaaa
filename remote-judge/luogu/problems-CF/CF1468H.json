    "description": "Let's denote the median of a sequence $ s $ with odd length as the value in the middle of $ s $ if we sort $ s $ in non-decreasing order. For example, let $ s = [1, 2, 5, 7, 2, 3, 12] $ . After sorting, we get sequence $ [1, 2, 2, \\underline{3}, 5, 7, 12] $ , and the median is equal to $ 3 $ .\n\nYou have a sequence of $ n $ integers $ [1, 2, \\dots, n] $ and an odd integer $ k $ .\n\nIn one step, you choose any $ k $ elements from the sequence and erase all chosen elements except their median. These elements do not have to go continuously (gaps are allowed between them).\n\nFor example, if you have a sequence $ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] $ (i.e. $ n=7 $ ) and $ k = 3 $ , then the following options for the first step are possible:\n\n- choose $ [1, \\underline{2}, 3] $ ; $ 2 $ is their median, so it is not erased, and the resulting sequence is $ [2, 4, 5, 6, 7] $ ;\n- choose $ [2, \\underline{4}, 6] $ ; $ 4 $ is their median, so it is not erased, and the resulting sequence is $ [1, 3, 4, 5, 7] $ ;\n- choose $ [1, \\underline{6}, 7] $ ; $ 6 $ is their median, so it is not erased, and the resulting sequence is $ [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] $ ;\n- and several others.\n\nYou can do zero or more steps. Can you get a sequence $ b_1 $ , $ b_2 $ , ..., $ b_m $ after several steps?\n\nYou'll be given $ t $ test cases. Solve each test case independently.",

    "hint": "In the first test case, you have sequence $ [1, 2, 3] $ . Since $ k = 3 $ you have only one way to choose $ k $ elements \u2014 it's to choose all elements $ [1, \\underline{2}, 3] $ with median $ 2 $ . That's why after erasing all chosen elements except its median you'll get sequence $ [2] $ . In other words, there is no way to get sequence $ b = [1] $ as the result.\n\nIn the second test case, you have sequence $ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] $ and one of the optimal strategies is following:\n\n1. choose $ k = 3 $ elements $ [2, \\underline{3}, 4] $ and erase them except its median; you'll get sequence $ [1, 3, 5, 6, 7] $ ;\n2. choose $ 3 $ elements $ [3, \\underline{5}, 6] $ and erase them except its median; you'll get desired sequence $ [1, 5, 7] $ ;\n\nIn the fourth test case, you have sequence $ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] $ . You can choose $ k=7 $ elements $ [2, 4, 6, \\underline{7}, 8, 10, 13] $ and erase them except its median to get sequence $ b $ .",
