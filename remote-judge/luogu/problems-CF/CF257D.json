    "description": "Vasya has found a piece of paper with an array written on it. The array consists of $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . Vasya noticed that the following condition holds for the array $ a_{i}<=a_{i+1}<=2\u00b7a_{i} $ for any positive integer $ i $ ( $ i&lt;n $ ).\n\nVasya wants to add either a \"+\" or a \"-\" before each number of array. Thus, Vasya will get an expression consisting of $ n $ summands. The value of the resulting expression is the sum of all its elements. The task is to add signs \"+\" and \"-\" before each number so that the value of expression $ s $ meets the limits $ 0<=s<=a_{1} $ . Print a sequence of signs \"+\" and \"-\", satisfying the given limits. It is guaranteed that the solution for the problem exists.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) \u2014 the size of the array. The second line contains space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the original array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the condition $ a_{i}<=a_{i+1}<=2\u00b7a_{i} $ fulfills for any positive integer $ i $ ( $ i&lt;n $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "In a single line print the sequence of $ n $ characters \"+\" and \"-\", where the $ i $ -th character is the sign that is placed in front of number $ a_{i} $ . The value of the resulting expression $ s $ must fit into the limits $ 0<=s<=a_{1} $ . If there are multiple solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.",
