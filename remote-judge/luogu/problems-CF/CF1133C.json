    "description": "You are a coach at your local university. There are $ n $ students under your supervision, the programming skill of the $ i $ -th student is $ a_i $ .\n\nYou have to create a team for a new programming competition. As you know, the more students some team has the more probable its victory is! So you have to create a team with the maximum number of students. But you also know that a team should be balanced. It means that the programming skill of each pair of students in a created team should differ by no more than $ 5 $ .\n\nYour task is to report the maximum possible number of students in a balanced team.",
