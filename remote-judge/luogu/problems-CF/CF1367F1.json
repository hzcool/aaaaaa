    "description": "This is an easy version of the problem. In this version, all numbers in the given array are distinct and the constraints on $ n $ are less than in the hard version of the problem.\n\nYou are given an array $ a $ of $ n $ integers (there are no equals elements in the array). You can perform the following operations on array elements:\n\n1. choose any index $ i $ ( $ 1 \\le i \\le n $ ) and move the element $ a[i] $ to the begin of the array;\n2. choose any index $ i $ ( $ 1 \\le i \\le n $ ) and move the element $ a[i] $ to the end of the array.\n\nFor example, if $ n = 5 $ , $ a = [4, 7, 2, 3, 9] $ , then the following sequence of operations can be performed:\n\n- after performing the operation of the first type to the second element, the array $ a $ will become $ [7, 4, 2, 3, 9] $ ;\n- after performing the operation of the second type to the second element, the array $ a $ will become $ [7, 2, 3, 9, 4] $ .\n\nYou can perform operations of any type any number of times in any order.\n\nFind the minimum total number of operations of the first and second type that will make the $ a $ array sorted in non-decreasing order. In other words, what is the minimum number of operations that must be performed so the array satisfies the inequalities $ a[1] \\le a[2] \\le \\ldots \\le a[n] $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case starts with a line containing an integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 3000 $ ) \u2014 length of the array $ a $ .\n\nThen follow $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 an array that needs to be sorted by the given operations. All numbers in the given array are distinct.\n\nThe sum of $ n $ for all test cases in one test does not exceed $ 3000 $ .",

Therefore, the desired sequence of operations: $ [4, 7, 2, 3, 9] \\rightarrow [3, 4, 7, 2, 9] \\rightarrow [2, 3, 4, 7, 9] $ .\n\nIn the second test case, you need to move the 1 to the beginning of the array, and the 8 \u2014 to the end. Therefore, the desired sequence of operations: $ [3, 5, 8, 1, 7] \\rightarrow [1, 3, 5, 8, 7] \\rightarrow [1, 3, 5, 7, 8] $ .\n\nIn the third test case, the array is already sorted.",
