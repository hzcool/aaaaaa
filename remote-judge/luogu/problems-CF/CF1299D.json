    "description": "Guy-Manuel and Thomas are planning $ 144 $ trips around the world.\n\nYou are given a simple weighted undirected connected graph with $ n $ vertexes and $ m $ edges with the following restriction: there isn't any simple cycle (i. e. a cycle which doesn't pass through any vertex more than once) of length greater than $ 3 $ which passes through the vertex $ 1 $ . The cost of a path (not necessarily simple) in this graph is defined as the [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of weights of all edges in that path with each edge being counted as many times as the path passes through it.\n\nBut the trips with cost $ 0 $ aren't exciting.\n\nYou may choose any subset of edges incident to the vertex $ 1 $ and remove them. How many are there such subsets, that, when removed, there is not any nontrivial cycle with the cost equal to $ 0 $ which passes through the vertex $ 1 $ in the resulting graph? A cycle is called nontrivial if it passes through some edge odd number of times. As the answer can be very big, output it modulo $ 10^9+7 $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \\le n,m \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertexes and edges in the graph. The $ i $ -th of the next $ m $ lines contains three integers $ a_i $ , $ b_i $ and $ w_i $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le n, a_i \\neq b_i, 0 \\le w_i < 32 $ ) \u2014 the endpoints of the $ i $ -th edge and its weight. It's guaranteed there aren't any multiple edges, the graph is connected and there isn't any simple cycle of length greater than $ 3 $ which passes through the vertex $ 1 $ .",
