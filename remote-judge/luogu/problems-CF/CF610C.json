    "description": "The semester is already ending, so Danil made an effort and decided to visit a lesson on harmony analysis to know how does the professor look like, at least. Danil was very bored on this lesson until the teacher gave the group a simple task: find $ 4 $ vectors in $ 4 $ -dimensional space, such that every coordinate of every vector is $ 1 $ or $ -1 $ and any two vectors are orthogonal. Just as a reminder, two vectors in $ n $ -dimensional space are considered to be orthogonal if and only if their scalar product is equal to zero, that is:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF610C/1ed68100811c8d9a7f92461867e21d565afe33d0.png).Danil quickly managed to come up with the solution for this problem and the teacher noticed that the problem can be solved in a more general case for $ 2^{k} $ vectors in $ 2^{k} $ -dimensinoal space. When Danil came home, he quickly came up with the solution for this problem. Can you cope with it?",

It's guaranteed that the answer always exists.\n\nIf there are many correct answers, print any.",
