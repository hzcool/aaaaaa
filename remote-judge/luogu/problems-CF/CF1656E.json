    "description": "You are given an undirected unrooted tree, i.e. a connected undirected graph without cycles.\n\nYou must assign a nonzero integer weight to each vertex so that the following is satisfied: if any vertex of the tree is removed, then each of the remaining connected components has the same sum of weights in its vertices.",
    "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 3 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices of the tree.\n\nThe next $ n-1 $ lines of each case contain each two integers $ u, v $ ( $ 1 \\leq u,v \\leq n $ ) denoting that there is an edge between vertices $ u $ and $ v $ . It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nThe sum of $ n $ for all test cases is at most $ 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, you must output one line with $ n $ space separated integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ , where $ a_i $ is the weight assigned to vertex $ i $ . The weights must satisfy $ -10^5 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^5 $ and $ a_i \\neq 0 $ .\n\nIt can be shown that there always exists a solution satisfying these constraints. If there are multiple possible solutions, output any of them.",
