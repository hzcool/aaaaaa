    "description": "For an array $ [b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m] $ define its number of inversions as the number of pairs $ (i, j) $ of integers such that $ 1 \\le i < j \\le m $ and $ b_i>b_j $ . Let's call array $ b $ odd if its number of inversions is odd.\n\nFor example, array $ [4, 2, 7] $ is odd, as its number of inversions is $ 1 $ , while array $ [2, 1, 4, 3] $ isn't, as its number of inversions is $ 2 $ .\n\nYou are given a permutation $ [p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n] $ of integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ (each of them appears exactly once in the permutation). You want to split it into several consecutive subarrays (maybe just one), so that the number of the odd subarrays among them is as large as possible.\n\nWhat largest number of these subarrays may be odd?",

    "hint": "In the first and third test cases, no matter how we split our permutation, there won't be any odd subarrays.\n\nIn the second test case, we can split our permutation into subarrays $ [4, 3], [2, 1] $ , both of which are odd since their numbers of inversions are $ 1 $ .\n\nIn the fourth test case, we can split our permutation into a single subarray $ [2, 1] $ , which is odd.\n\nIn the fifth test case, we can split our permutation into subarrays $ [4, 5], [6, 1, 2, 3] $ . The first subarray has $ 0 $ inversions, and the second has $ 3 $ , so it is odd.",
