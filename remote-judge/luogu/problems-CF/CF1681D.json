You may perform several operations with the integer $ x $ .\n\nEach operation you perform is the following one: choose any digit $ y $ that occurs in the decimal representation of $ x $ at least once, and replace $ x $ by $ x \\cdot y $ .\n\nYou want to make the length of decimal representation of $ x $ (without leading zeroes) equal to $ n $ . What is the minimum number of operations required to do that?",
