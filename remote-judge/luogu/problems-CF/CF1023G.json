    "description": "A group of researchers are studying fish population in a natural system of lakes and rivers. The system contains $ n $ lakes connected by $ n - 1 $ rivers. Each river has integer length (in kilometers) and can be traversed in both directions. It is possible to travel between any pair of lakes by traversing the rivers (that is, the network of lakes and rivers form a tree).\n\nThere is an unknown number of indistinguishable fish living in the lakes. On day $ 1 $ , fish can be at arbitrary lakes. Fish can travel between lakes by swimming the rivers. Each fish can swim a river $ l $ kilometers long in any direction in $ l $ days. Further, each fish can stay any number of days in any particular lake it visits. No fish ever appear or disappear from the lake system. Each lake can accomodate any number of fish at any time.\n\nThe researchers made several observations. The $ j $ -th of these observations is \"on day $ d_j $ there were at least $ f_j $ distinct fish in the lake $ p_j $ \". Help the researchers in determining the smallest possible total number of fish living in the lake system that doesn't contradict the observations.",

The $ j $ -th of these lines contains three integers $ d_j $ , $ f_j $ , $ p_j $ ( $ 1 \\leq d_j \\leq 10^8 $ , $ 1 \\leq f_j \\leq 10^4 $ , $ 1 \\leq p_j \\leq n $ ) \u2014 the day, the number of fish, and the lake index of the $ j $ -th observation.
