    "description": "You are playing a computer game, where you lead a party of $ m $ soldiers. Each soldier is characterised by his agility $ a_i $ .\n\nThe level you are trying to get through can be represented as a straight line segment from point $ 0 $ (where you and your squad is initially located) to point $ n + 1 $ (where the boss is located).\n\nThe level is filled with $ k $ traps. Each trap is represented by three numbers $ l_i $ , $ r_i $ and $ d_i $ . $ l_i $ is the location of the trap, and $ d_i $ is the danger level of the trap: whenever a soldier with agility lower than $ d_i $ steps on a trap (that is, moves to the point $ l_i $ ), he gets instantly killed. Fortunately, you can disarm traps: if you move to the point $ r_i $ , you disarm this trap, and it no longer poses any danger to your soldiers. Traps don't affect you, only your soldiers.\n\nYou have $ t $ seconds to complete the level \u2014 that is, to bring some soldiers from your squad to the boss. Before the level starts, you choose which soldiers will be coming with you, and which soldiers won't be. After that, you have to bring all of the chosen soldiers to the boss. To do so, you may perform the following actions:\n\n- if your location is $ x $ , you may move to $ x + 1 $ or $ x - 1 $ . This action consumes one second;\n- if your location is $ x $ and the location of your squad is $ x $ , you may move to $ x + 1 $ or to $ x - 1 $ with your squad in one second. You may not perform this action if it puts some soldier in danger (i. e. the point your squad is moving into contains a non-disarmed trap with $ d_i $ greater than agility of some soldier from the squad). This action consumes one second;\n- if your location is $ x $ and there is a trap $ i $ with $ r_i = x $ , you may disarm this trap. This action is done instantly (it consumes no time).\n\nNote that after each action both your coordinate and the coordinate of your squad should be integers.\n\nYou have to choose the maximum number of soldiers such that they all can be brought from the point $ 0 $ to the point $ n + 1 $ (where the boss waits) in no more than $ t $ seconds.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains four integers $ m $ , $ n $ , $ k $ and $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le m, n, k, t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ , $ n < t $ ) \u2014 the number of soldiers, the number of integer points between the squad and the boss, the number of traps and the maximum number of seconds you may spend to bring the squad to the boss, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $ m $ integers $ a_1 $ , $ a_2 $ , ..., $ a_m $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ), where $ a_i $ is the agility of the $ i $ -th soldier.\n\nThen $ k $ lines follow, containing the descriptions of traps. Each line contains three numbers $ l_i $ , $ r_i $ and $ d_i $ ( $ 1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n $ , $ 1 \\le d_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the location of the trap, the location where the trap can be disarmed, and its danger level, respectively.",

The course of action is as follows:\n\n- go to $ 2 $ without your squad;\n- disarm the trap $ 2 $ ;\n- go to $ 3 $ without your squad;\n- disartm the trap $ 3 $ ;\n- go to $ 0 $ without your squad;\n- go to $ 7 $ with your squad.\n\nThe whole plan can be executed in $ 13 $ seconds.",
