    "description": "You are given a string $ s $ consisting only of characters 0 and 1. A substring $ [l,r] $ of $ s $ is a string $ s_{l}s_{l+1}s_{l+2}...\\ s_{r} $ , and its length equals to $ r-l+1 $ . A substring is called balanced if the number of zeroes (0) equals to the number of ones in this substring.\n\nYou have to determine the length of the longest balanced substring of $ s $ .",

    "outputFormat": "If there is no non-empty balanced substring in $ s $ , print 0. Otherwise, print the length of the longest balanced substring.",
