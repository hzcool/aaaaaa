    "description": "Every superhero has been given a power value by the Felicity Committee. The avengers crew wants to maximize the average power of the superheroes in their team by performing certain operations.\n\nInitially, there are $ n $ superheroes in avengers team having powers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ , respectively. In one operation, they can remove one superhero from their team (if there are at least two) or they can increase the power of a superhero by $ 1 $ . They can do at most $ m $ operations. Also, on a particular superhero at most $ k $ operations can be done.\n\nCan you help the avengers team to maximize the average power of their crew?",
