    "description": "You are given a tree of $ n $ vertices numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , with edges numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n-1 $ . A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. You have to assign integer weights to each edge of the tree, such that the resultant graph is a prime tree.\n\nA prime tree is a tree where the weight of every path consisting of one or two edges is prime. A path should not visit any vertex twice. The weight of a path is the sum of edge weights on that path.\n\nConsider the graph below. It is a prime tree as the weight of every path of two or less edges is prime. For example, the following path of two edges: $ 2 \\to 1 \\to 3 $ has a weight of $ 11 + 2 = 13 $ , which is prime. Similarly, the path of one edge: $ 4 \\to 3 $ has a weight of $ 5 $ , which is also prime.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1627C/3add991eaafca4c0491e3513c8ebd38f1627bca9.png)Print any valid assignment of weights such that the resultant tree is a prime tree. If there is no such assignment, then print $ -1 $ . It can be proven that if a valid assignment exists, one exists with weights between $ 1 $ and $ 10^5 $ as well.",
    "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThen, $ n-1 $ lines follow. The $ i $ -th line contains two integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1 \\leq u, v \\leq n $ ) denoting that edge number $ i $ is between vertices $ u $ and $ v $ . It is guaranteed that the edges form a tree.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, if a valid assignment exists, then print a single line containing $ n-1 $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{n-1} $ ( $ 1 \\leq a_i \\le 10^5 $ ), where $ a_i $ denotes the weight assigned to the edge numbered $ i $ . Otherwise, print $ -1 $ .\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any.",
