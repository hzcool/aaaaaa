    "description": "Andrewid the Android is a galaxy-famous detective. He is now investigating the case of vandalism at the exhibition of contemporary art.\n\nThe main exhibit is a construction of $ n $ matryoshka dolls that can be nested one into another. The matryoshka dolls are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . A matryoshka with a smaller number can be nested in a matryoshka with a higher number, two matryoshkas can not be directly nested in the same doll, but there may be chain nestings, for example, $ 1\u21922\u21924\u21925 $ .\n\nIn one second, you can perform one of the two following operations:\n\n- Having a matryoshka $ a $ that isn't nested in any other matryoshka and a matryoshka $ b $ , such that $ b $ doesn't contain any other matryoshka and is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may put $ a $ in $ b $ ;\n- Having a matryoshka $ a $ directly contained in matryoshka $ b $ , such that $ b $ is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may get $ a $ out of $ b $ .\n\nAccording to the modern aesthetic norms the matryoshka dolls on display were assembled in a specific configuration, i.e. as several separate chains of nested matryoshkas, but the criminal, following the mysterious plan, took out all the dolls and assembled them into a single large chain ( $ 1\u21922\u2192...\u2192n $ ). In order to continue the investigation Andrewid needs to know in what minimum time it is possible to perform this action.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integers $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) and $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=10^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of matryoshkas and matryoshka chains in the initial configuration.\n\nThe next $ k $ lines contain the descriptions of the chains: the $ i $ -th line first contains number $ m_{i} $ ( $ 1<=m_{i}<=n $ ), and then $ m_{i} $ numbers $ a_{i1},a_{i2},...,a_{imi} $ \u2014 the numbers of matryoshkas in the chain (matryoshka $ a_{i1} $ is nested into matryoshka $ a_{i2} $ , that is nested into matryoshka $ a_{i3} $ , and so on till the matryoshka $ a_{imi} $ that isn't nested into any other matryoshka).\n\nIt is guaranteed that $ m_{1}+m_{2}+...+m_{k}=n $ , the numbers of matryoshkas in all the chains are distinct, in each chain the numbers of matryoshkas follow in the ascending order.",

In one second you can nest the first chain into the second one and get $ 1\u21922\u21923 $ .\n\nIn the second sample test you need to disassemble all the three chains into individual matryoshkas in 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 seconds and then assemble one big chain in 6 seconds.",
