    "description": "Polycarp watched TV-show where $ k $ jury members one by one rated a participant by adding him a certain number of points (may be negative, i. e. points were subtracted). Initially the participant had some score, and each the marks were one by one added to his score. It is known that the $ i $ -th jury member gave $ a_{i} $ points.\n\nPolycarp does not remember how many points the participant had before this $ k $ marks were given, but he remembers that among the scores announced after each of the $ k $ judges rated the participant there were $ n $ ( $ n<=k $ ) values $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ (it is guaranteed that all values $ b_{j} $ are distinct). It is possible that Polycarp remembers not all of the scores announced, i. e. $ n&lt;k $ . Note that the initial score wasn't announced.\n\nYour task is to determine the number of options for the score the participant could have before the judges rated the participant.",
