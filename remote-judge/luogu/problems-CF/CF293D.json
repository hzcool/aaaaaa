    "description": "Ksusha is a vigorous mathematician. She is keen on absolutely incredible mathematical riddles.\n\nToday Ksusha came across a convex polygon of non-zero area. She is now wondering: if she chooses a pair of distinct points uniformly among all integer points (points with integer coordinates) inside or on the border of the polygon and then draws a square with two opposite vertices lying in the chosen points, what will the expectation of this square's area be?\n\nA pair of distinct points is chosen uniformly among all pairs of distinct points, located inside or on the border of the polygon. Pairs of points $ p,q $ $ (p\u2260q) $ and $ q,p $ are considered the same.\n\nHelp Ksusha! Count the required expectation.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (3<=n<=10^{5}) $ \u2014 the number of vertices of Ksusha's convex polygon. Next $ n $ lines contain the coordinates of the polygon vertices in clockwise or counterclockwise order. The $ i $ -th line contains integers $ x_{i},y_{i} $ $ (|x_{i}|,|y_{i}|<=10^{6}) $ \u2014 the coordinates of the vertex that goes $ i $ -th in that order.",
    "outputFormat": "Print a single real number \u2014 the required expected area.\n\nThe answer will be considered correct if its absolute and relative error doesn't exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .",
