    "description": "Wu got hungry after an intense training session, and came to a nearby store to buy his favourite instant noodles. After Wu paid for his purchase, the cashier gave him an interesting task.\n\nYou are given a bipartite graph with positive integers in all vertices of the right half. For a subset $ S $ of vertices of the left half we define $ N(S) $ as the set of all vertices of the right half adjacent to at least one vertex in $ S $ , and $ f(S) $ as the sum of all numbers in vertices of $ N(S) $ . Find the greatest common divisor of $ f(S) $ for all possible non-empty subsets $ S $ (assume that GCD of empty set is $ 0 $ ).\n\nWu is too tired after his training to solve this problem. Help him!",

Test case descriptions follow.\n\nThe first line of each case description contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1~\\leq~n,~m~\\leq~500\\,000 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in either half of the graph, and the number of edges respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ c_i $ ( $ 1 \\leq c_i \\leq 10^{12} $ ). The $ i $ -th number describes the integer in the vertex $ i $ of the right half of the graph.\n\nEach of the following $ m $ lines contains a pair of integers $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ ( $ 1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n $ ), describing an edge between the vertex $ u_i $ of the left half and the vertex $ v_i $ of the right half. It is guaranteed that the graph does not contain multiple edges.\n\nTest case descriptions are separated with empty lines. The total value of $ n $ across all test cases does not exceed $ 500\\,000 $ , and the total value of $ m $ across all test cases does not exceed $ 500\\,000 $ as well.",
