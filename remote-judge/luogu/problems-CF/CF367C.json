    "description": "Let's call an array consisting of $ n $ integer numbers $ a_{1} $ , $ a_{2} $ , $ ... $ , $ a_{n} $ , beautiful if it has the following property:\n\n- consider all pairs of numbers $ x,y $ $ (x\u2260y) $ , such that number $ x $ occurs in the array $ a $ and number $ y $ occurs in the array $ a $ ;\n- for each pair $ x,y $ must exist some position $ j $ $ (1<=j&lt;n) $ , such that at least one of the two conditions are met, either $ a_{j}=x,a_{j+1}=y $ , or $ a_{j}=y,a_{j+1}=x $ .\n\nSereja wants to build a beautiful array $ a $ , consisting of $ n $ integers. But not everything is so easy, Sereja's friend Dima has $ m $ coupons, each contains two integers $ q_{i},w_{i} $ . Coupon $ i $ costs $ w_{i} $ and allows you to use as many numbers $ q_{i} $ as you want when constructing the array $ a $ . Values $ q_{i} $ are distinct. Sereja has no coupons, so Dima and Sereja have made the following deal. Dima builds some beautiful array $ a $ of $ n $ elements. After that he takes $ w_{i} $ rubles from Sereja for each $ q_{i} $ , which occurs in the array $ a $ . Sereja believed his friend and agreed to the contract, and now he is wondering, what is the maximum amount of money he can pay.\n\nHelp Sereja, find the maximum amount of money he can pay to Dima.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ $ (1<=n<=2\u00b710^{6},1<=m<=10^{5}) $ . Next $ m $ lines contain pairs of integers. The $ i $ -th line contains numbers $ q_{i},w_{i} $ $ (1<=q_{i},w_{i}<=10^{5}) $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that all $ q_{i} $ are distinct.",
