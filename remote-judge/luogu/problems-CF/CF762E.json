    "description": "In the lattice points of the coordinate line there are $ n $ radio stations, the $ i $ -th of which is described by three integers:\n\n- $ x_{i} $ \u2014 the coordinate of the $ i $ -th station on the line,\n- $ r_{i} $ \u2014 the broadcasting range of the $ i $ -th station,\n- $ f_{i} $ \u2014 the broadcasting frequency of the $ i $ -th station.\n\nWe will say that two radio stations with numbers $ i $ and $ j $ reach each other, if the broadcasting range of each of them is more or equal to the distance between them. In other words $ min(r_{i},r_{j})>=|x_{i}-x_{j}| $ .\n\nLet's call a pair of radio stations $ (i,j) $ bad if $ i&lt;j $ , stations $ i $ and $ j $ reach each other and they are close in frequency, that is, $ |f_{i}-f_{j}|<=k $ .\n\nFind the number of bad pairs of radio stations.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ , $ 0<=k<=10 $ ) \u2014 the number of radio stations and the maximum difference in the frequencies for the pair of stations that reach each other to be considered bad.\n\nIn the next $ n $ lines follow the descriptions of radio stations. Each line contains three integers $ x_{i} $ , $ r_{i} $ and $ f_{i} $ ( $ 1<=x_{i},r_{i}<=10^{9} $ , $ 1<=f_{i}<=10^{4} $ ) \u2014 the coordinate of the $ i $ -th radio station, it's broadcasting range and it's broadcasting frequency. No two radio stations will share a coordinate.",
