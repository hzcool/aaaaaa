    "description": "There are $ n $ military men in the Berland army. Some of them have given orders to other military men by now. Given $ m $ pairs ( $ x_{i} $ , $ y_{i} $ ), meaning that the military man $ x_{i} $ gave the $ i $ -th order to another military man $ y_{i} $ .\n\nIt is time for reform! The Berland Ministry of Defence plans to introduce ranks in the Berland army. Each military man should be assigned a rank \u2014 integer number between $ 1 $ and $ k $ , inclusive. Some of them have been already assigned a rank, but the rest of them should get a rank soon.\n\nHelp the ministry to assign ranks to the rest of the army so that:\n\n- for each of $ m $ orders it is true that the rank of a person giving the order (military man $ x_{i} $ ) is strictly greater than the rank of a person receiving the order (military man $ y_{i} $ );\n- for each rank from $ 1 $ to $ k $ there is at least one military man with this rank.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=2\u00b710^{5} $ , $ 0<=m<=2\u00b710^{5} $ , $ 1<=k<=2\u00b710^{5} $ ) \u2014 number of military men in the Berland army, number of orders and number of ranks.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ r_{1},r_{2},...,r_{n} $ , where $ r_{i}>0 $ (in this case $ 1<=r_{i}<=k $ ) means that the $ i $ -th military man has been already assigned the rank $ r_{i} $ ; $ r_{i}=0 $ means the $ i $ -th military man doesn't have a rank yet.\n\nThe following $ m $ lines contain orders one per line. Each order is described with a line containing two integers $ x_{i} $ , $ y_{i} $ ( $ 1<=x_{i},y_{i}<=n $ , $ x_{i}\u2260y_{i} $ ). This line means that the $ i $ -th order was given by the military man $ x_{i} $ to the military man $ y_{i} $ . For each pair $ (x,y) $ of military men there could be several orders from $ x $ to $ y $ .",
