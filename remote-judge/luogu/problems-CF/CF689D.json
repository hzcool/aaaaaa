Being given a query of the form of pair of integers $ (l,r) $ , Mike can instantly tell the value of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF689D/77a91e450d8c58a8cff349889db0f7900b8e3ace.png) while !Mike can instantly tell the value of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF689D/7594cca965e5cc163cc16e32e5bed1c0ba0fa037.png).\n\nNow suppose a robot (you!) asks them all possible different queries of pairs of integers $ (l,r) $ $ (1<=l<=r<=n) $ (so he will make exactly $ n(n+1)/2 $ queries) and counts how many times their answers coincide, thus for how many pairs ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF689D/72e28ce968021e0cd2b5fe1a6f144994e8f8338b.png) is satisfied.\n\nHow many occasions will the robot count?",
