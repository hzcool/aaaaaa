    "description": "You are given two strings $ a $ and $ b $ . You have to remove the minimum possible number of consecutive (standing one after another) characters from string $ b $ in such a way that it becomes a subsequence of string $ a $ . It can happen that you will not need to remove any characters at all, or maybe you will have to remove all of the characters from $ b $ and make it empty.\n\nSubsequence of string $ s $ is any such string that can be obtained by erasing zero or more characters (not necessarily consecutive) from string $ s $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains string $ a $ , and the second line \u2014 string $ b $ . Both of these strings are nonempty and consist of lowercase letters of English alphabet. The length of each string is no bigger than $ 10^{5} $ characters.",
    "outputFormat": "On the first line output a subsequence of string $ a $ , obtained from $ b $ by erasing the minimum number of consecutive characters.\n\nIf the answer consists of zero characters, output \u00ab-\u00bb (a minus sign).",

    "hint": "In the first example strings $ a $ and $ b $ don't share any symbols, so the longest string that you can get is empty.\n\nIn the second example ac is a subsequence of $ a $ , and at the same time you can obtain it by erasing consecutive symbols cepted from string $ b $ .",
