    "description": "The map of Europe can be represented by a set of $ n $ cities, numbered from $ 1 $ through $ n $ , which are connected by $ m $ bidirectional roads, each of which connects two distinct cities. A trip of length $ k $ is a sequence of $ k+1 $ cities $ v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_{k+1} $ such that there is a road connecting each consecutive pair $ v_i $ , $ v_{i+1} $ of cities, for all $ 1 \\le i \\le k $ . A special trip is a trip that does not use the same road twice in a row, i.e., a sequence of $ k+1 $ cities $ v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_{k+1} $ such that it forms a trip and $ v_i \\neq v_{i + 2} $ , for all $ 1 \\le i \\le k - 1 $ .\n\nGiven an integer $ k $ , compute the number of distinct special trips of length $ k $ which begin and end in the same city.
