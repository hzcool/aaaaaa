    "description": "The Smart Beaver from ABBYY began to develop a new educational game for children. The rules of the game are fairly simple and are described below.\n\nThe playing field is a sequence of $ n $ non-negative integers $ a_{i} $ numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The goal of the game is to make numbers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{k} $ (i.e. some prefix of the sequence) equal to zero for some fixed $ k $ $ (k<n) $ , and this should be done in the smallest possible number of moves.\n\nOne move is choosing an integer $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) such that $ a_{i}>0 $ and an integer $ t $ $ (t>=0) $ such that $ i+2^{t}<=n $ . After the values of $ i $ and $ t $ have been selected, the value of $ a_{i} $ is decreased by $ 1 $ , and the value of $ a_{i+2^{t}} $ is increased by $ 1 $ . For example, let $ n=4 $ and $ a=(1,0,1,2) $ , then it is possible to make move $ i=3 $ , $ t=0 $ and get $ a=(1,0,0,3) $ or to make move $ i=1 $ , $ t=1 $ and get $ a=(0,0,2,2) $ (the only possible other move is $ i=1 $ , $ t=0 $ ).\n\nYou are given $ n $ and the initial sequence $ a_{i} $ . The task is to calculate the minimum number of moves needed to make the first $ k $ elements of the original sequence equal to zero for each possible $ k $ $ (1<=k<n) $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first input line contains a single integer $ n $ . The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=10^{4} $ ), separated by single spaces.\n\nThe input limitations for getting 20 points are:\n\n- $ 1<=n<=300 $\n\nThe input limitations for getting 50 points are:\n\n- $ 1<=n<=2000 $\n\nThe input limitations for getting 100 points are:\n\n- $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $",
    "outputFormat": "Print exactly $ n-1 $ lines: the $ k $ -th output line must contain the minimum number of moves needed to make the first $ k $ elements of the original sequence $ a_{i} $ equal to zero.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams, or the %I64d specifier.",
