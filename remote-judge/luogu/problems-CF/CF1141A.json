    "description": "Polycarp plays \"Game 23\". Initially he has a number $ n $ and his goal is to transform it to $ m $ . In one move, he can multiply $ n $ by $ 2 $ or multiply $ n $ by $ 3 $ . He can perform any number of moves.\n\nPrint the number of moves needed to transform $ n $ to $ m $ . Print -1 if it is impossible to do so.\n\nIt is easy to prove that any way to transform $ n $ to $ m $ contains the same number of moves (i.e. number of moves doesn't depend on the way of transformation).",

Thus, the answer is $ 0 $ .\n\nIn the third example, it is impossible to transform $ 48 $ to $ 72 $ .",
