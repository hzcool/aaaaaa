    "description": "A telephone number is a sequence of exactly 11 digits, where the first digit is 8. For example, the sequence 80011223388 is a telephone number, but the sequences 70011223388 and 80000011223388 are not.\n\nYou are given a string $ s $ of length $ n $ , consisting of digits.\n\nIn one operation you can delete any character from string $ s $ . For example, it is possible to obtain strings 112, 111 or 121 from string 1121.\n\nYou need to determine whether there is such a sequence of operations (possibly empty), after which the string $ s $ becomes a telephone number.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the length of string $ s $ .\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string $ s $ ( $ |s| = n $ ) consisting of digits.",
    "outputFormat": "For each test print one line.\n\nIf there is a sequence of operations, after which $ s $ becomes a telephone number, print YES.\n\nOtherwise, print NO.",
