    "description": "You are given a tree (a graph with $ n $ vertices and $ n-1 $ edges in which it's possible to reach any vertex from any other vertex using only its edges).\n\nA vertex can be destroyed if this vertex has even degree. If you destroy a vertex, all edges connected to it are also deleted.\n\nDestroy all vertices in the given tree or determine that it is impossible.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2\u00b710^{5} $ ) \u2014 number of vertices in a tree.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ ( $ 0<=p_{i}<=n $ ). If $ p_{i}\u22600 $ there is an edge between vertices $ i $ and $ p_{i} $ . It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.",
    "outputFormat": "If it's possible to destroy all vertices, print \"YES\" (without quotes), otherwise print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\nIf it's possible to destroy all vertices, in the next $ n $ lines print the indices of the vertices in order you destroy them.

After that there are no edges in the tree, so you can remove remaining vertices in any order.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF963B/9b84e98fe96447b82c6a8ccba7a9e4a5189ce14b.png)",
