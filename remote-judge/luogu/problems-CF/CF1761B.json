    "description": "Define a cyclic sequence of size $ n $ as an array $ s $ of length $ n $ , in which $ s_n $ is adjacent to $ s_1 $ .\n\nMuxii has a ring represented by a cyclic sequence $ a $ of size $ n $ .\n\nHowever, the ring itself hates equal adjacent elements. So if two adjacent elements in the sequence are equal at any time, one of them will be erased immediately. The sequence doesn't contain equal adjacent elements initially.\n\nMuxii can perform the following operation until the sequence becomes empty:\n\n- Choose an element in $ a $ and erase it.\n\nFor example, if ring is $ [1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 2] $ , and Muxii erases element $ 4 $ , then ring would erase one of the elements equal to $ 2 $ , and the ring will become $ [1, 2, 3, 2] $ .\n\nMuxii wants to find the maximum number of operations he could perform.\n\nNote that in a ring of size $ 1 $ , its only element isn't considered adjacent to itself (so it's not immediately erased).",
