    "description": "Roma works in a company that sells TVs. Now he has to prepare a report for the last year.\n\nRoma has got a list of the company's incomes. The list is a sequence that consists of $ n $ integers. The total income of the company is the sum of all integers in sequence. Roma decided to perform exactly $ k $ changes of signs of several numbers in the sequence. He can also change the sign of a number one, two or more times.\n\nThe operation of changing a number's sign is the operation of multiplying this number by - $ 1 $ .\n\nHelp Roma perform the changes so as to make the total income of the company (the sum of numbers in the resulting sequence) maximum. Note that Roma should perform exactly $ k $ changes.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ $ (1<=n,k<=10^{5}) $ , showing, how many numbers are in the sequence and how many swaps are to be made.\n\nThe second line contains a non-decreasing sequence, consisting of $ n $ integers $ a_{i} $ $ (|a_{i}|<=10^{4}) $ .\n\nThe numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces. Please note that the given sequence is sorted in non-decreasing order.",

    "hint": "In the first sample we can get sequence \\[1, 1, 1\\], thus the total income equals $ 3 $ .\n\nIn the second test, the optimal strategy is to get sequence \\[-1, 1, 1\\], thus the total income equals $ 1 $ .",
