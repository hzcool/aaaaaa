    "description": "Fox Ciel is playing a card game with her friend Fox Jiro. There are $ n $ piles of cards on the table. And there is a positive integer on each card.\n\nThe players take turns and Ciel takes the first turn. In Ciel's turn she takes a card from the top of any non-empty pile, and in Jiro's turn he takes a card from the bottom of any non-empty pile. Each player wants to maximize the total sum of the cards he took. The game ends when all piles become empty.\n\nSuppose Ciel and Jiro play optimally, what is the score of the game?",

Each of the next $ n $ lines contains a description of the pile: the first integer in the line is $ s_{i} $ ( $ 1<=s_{i}<=100 $ ) \u2014 the number of cards in the $ i $ -th pile; then follow $ s_{i} $ positive integers $ c_{1} $ , $ c_{2} $ , ..., $ c_{k} $ , ..., $ c_{si} $ ( $ 1<=c_{k}<=1000 $ ) \u2014 the sequence of the numbers on the cards listed from top of the current pile to bottom of the pile.",
