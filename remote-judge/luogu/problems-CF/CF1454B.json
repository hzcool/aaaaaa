    "description": "There is a game called \"Unique Bid Auction\". You can read more about it here: <a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique\\_bid\\_auction</a> (though you don't have to do it to solve this problem).\n\nLet's simplify this game a bit. Formally, there are $ n $ participants, the $ i $ -th participant chose the number $ a_i $ . The winner of the game is such a participant that the number he chose is unique (i. e. nobody else chose this number except him) and is minimal (i. e. among all unique values of $ a $ the minimum one is the winning one).\n\nYour task is to find the index of the participant who won the game (or -1 if there is no winner). Indexing is $ 1 $ -based, i. e. the participants are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .\n\nYou have to answer $ t $ independent test cases.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of participants. The second line of the test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le n $ ), where $ a_i $ is the $ i $ -th participant chosen number.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ( $ \\sum n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the answer \u2014 the index of the participant who won the game (or -1 if there is no winner). Note that the answer is always unique.",
