    "description": "When Petya has free from computer games time, he attends university classes. Every day the lessons on Petya\u2019s faculty consist of two double classes. The floor where the lessons take place is a long corridor with $ M $ classrooms numbered from $ 1 $ to $ M $ , situated along it.\n\nAll the students of Petya\u2019s year are divided into $ N $ groups. Petya has noticed recently that these groups\u2019 timetable has the following peculiarity: the number of the classroom where the first lesson of a group takes place does not exceed the number of the classroom where the second lesson of this group takes place.\n\nOnce Petya decided to count the number of ways in which one can make a lesson timetable for all these groups. The timetable is a set of $ 2N $ numbers: for each group the number of the rooms where the first and the second lessons take place. Unfortunately, he quickly lost the track of his calculations and decided to count only the timetables that satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1\\) On the first lesson in classroom $ i $ exactly $ X_{i} $ groups must be present.\n\n2\\) In classroom $ i $ no more than $ Y_{i} $ groups may be placed.\n\nHelp Petya count the number of timetables satisfying all those conditions\u044e As there can be a lot of such timetables, output modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ M $ ( $ 1<=M<=100 $ ) \u2014 the number of classrooms.\n\nThe second line contains $ M $ space-separated integers \u2014 $ X_{i} $ ( $ 0<=X_{i}<=100 $ ) the amount of groups present in classroom $ i $ during the first lesson.\n\nThe third line contains $ M $ space-separated integers \u2014 $ Y_{i} $ ( $ 0<=Y_{i}<=100 $ ) the maximal amount of groups that can be present in classroom $ i $ at the same time.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all the $ X_{i}<=Y_{i} $ , and that the sum of all the $ X_{i} $ is positive and does not exceed $ 1000 $ .",
