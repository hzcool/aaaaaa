In this version, the given array can contain equal elements and the constraints on $ n $ are greater than in the easy version of the problem.\n\nYou are given an array $ a $ of $ n $ integers (the given array can contain equal elements). You can perform the following operations on array elements:\n\n1. choose any index $ i $ ( $ 1 \\le i \\le n $ ) and move the element $ a[i] $ to the begin of the array;\n2. choose any index $ i $ ( $ 1 \\le i \\le n $ ) and move the element $ a[i] $ to the end of the array.\n\nFor example, if $ n = 5 $ , $ a = [4, 7, 2, 2, 9] $ , then the following sequence of operations can be performed:\n\n- after performing the operation of the first type to the second element, the array $ a $ will become $ [7, 4, 2, 2, 9] $ ;\n- after performing the operation of the second type to the second element, the array $ a $ will become $ [7, 2, 2, 9, 4] $ .\n\nYou can perform operations of any type any number of times in any order.\n\nFind the minimum total number of operations of the first and second type that will make the $ a $ array sorted in non-decreasing order. In other words, what is the minimum number of operations must be performed so the array satisfies the inequalities $ a[1] \\le a[2] \\le \\ldots \\le a[n] $ .",
