    "description": "There are $ n $ boys and $ m $ girls attending a theatre club. To set a play \"The Big Bang Theory\", they need to choose a group containing exactly $ t $ actors containing no less than 4 boys and no less than one girl. How many ways are there to choose a group? Of course, the variants that only differ in the composition of the troupe are considered different.\n\nPerform all calculations in the 64-bit type: long long for \u0421/\u0421++, int64 for Delphi and long for Java.",
    "inputFormat": "The only line of the input data contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ t $ ( $ 4<=n<=30,1<=m<=30,5<=t<=n+m $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "Find the required number of ways.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.",
