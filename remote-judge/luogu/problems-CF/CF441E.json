    "description": "Valera is a coder. Recently he wrote a funny program. The pseudo code for this program is given below:\n\n```plain\n//input: integers x, k, p\na = x;\nfor(step = 1; step <= k; step = step + 1){\n    rnd = [random integer from 1 to 100];\n    if(rnd <= p)\n        a = a * 2;\n    else\n        a = a + 1;\n}\n\ns = 0;\n\nwhile(remainder after dividing a by 2 equals 0){\n    a = a / 2;\n    s = s + 1;\n}\n```\n\nNow Valera wonders: given the values $ x $ , $ k $ and $ p $ , what is the expected value of the resulting number $ s $ ?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains three integers $ x,k,p $ ( $ 1<=x<=10^{9};\u00a01<=k<=200;\u00a00<=p<=100 $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "Print the required expected value. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .",
