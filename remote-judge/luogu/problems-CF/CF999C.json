    "description": "You are given a string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ lowercase Latin letters. Polycarp wants to remove exactly $ k $ characters ( $ k \\le n $ ) from the string $ s $ . Polycarp uses the following algorithm $ k $ times:\n\n- if there is at least one letter 'a', remove the leftmost occurrence and stop the algorithm, otherwise go to next item;\n- if there is at least one letter 'b', remove the leftmost occurrence and stop the algorithm, otherwise go to next item;\n- ...\n- remove the leftmost occurrence of the letter 'z' and stop the algorithm.\n\nThis algorithm removes a single letter from the string. Polycarp performs this algorithm exactly $ k $ times, thus removing exactly $ k $ characters.\n\nHelp Polycarp find the resulting string.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le k \\le n \\le 4 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the length of the string and the number of letters Polycarp will remove.\n\nThe second line contains the string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ lowercase Latin letters.",
    "outputFormat": "Print the string that will be obtained from $ s $ after Polycarp removes exactly $ k $ letters using the above algorithm $ k $ times.\n\nIf the resulting string is empty, print nothing. It is allowed to print nothing or an empty line (line break).",
