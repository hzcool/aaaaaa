    "description": "Ildar is the algorithm teacher of William and Harris. Today, Ildar is teaching Cartesian Tree. However, Harris is sick, so Ildar is only teaching William.\n\nA cartesian tree is a rooted tree, that can be constructed from a sequence of distinct integers. We build the cartesian tree as follows:\n\n1. If the sequence is empty, return an empty tree;\n2. Let the position of the maximum element be $ x $ ;\n3. Remove element on the position $ x $ from the sequence and break it into the left part and the right part (which might be empty) (not actually removing it, just taking it away temporarily);\n4. Build cartesian tree for each part;\n5. Create a new vertex for the element, that was on the position $ x $ which will serve as the root of the new tree. Then, for the root of the left part and right part, if exists, will become the children for this vertex;\n6. Return the tree we have gotten.\n\nFor example, this is the cartesian tree for the sequence $ 4, 2, 7, 3, 5, 6, 1 $ :\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1290E/acc7800e10b8c919d4950616a18f2140e891d16a.png)After teaching what the cartesian tree is, Ildar has assigned homework. He starts with an empty sequence $ a $ .\n\nIn the $ i $ -th round, he inserts an element with value $ i $ somewhere in $ a $ . Then, he asks a question: what is the sum of the sizes of the subtrees for every node in the cartesian tree for the current sequence $ a $ ?\n\nNode $ v $ is in the node $ u $ subtree if and only if $ v = u $ or $ v $ is in the subtree of one of the vertex $ u $ children. The size of the subtree of node $ u $ is the number of nodes $ v $ such that $ v $ is in the subtree of $ u $ .\n\nIldar will do $ n $ rounds in total. The homework is the sequence of answers to the $ n $ questions.\n\nThe next day, Ildar told Harris that he has to complete the homework as well. Harris obtained the final state of the sequence $ a $ from William. However, he has no idea how to find the answers to the $ n $ questions. Help Harris!",
