    "description": "Pak Chanek plans to build a garage. He wants the garage to consist of a square and a right triangle that are arranged like the following illustration.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1725G/7e485d3e8037daefec2b8ca00b8b11546f3e5f77.png)Define $ a $ and $ b $ as the lengths of two of the sides in the right triangle as shown in the illustration. An integer $ x $ is suitable if and only if we can construct a garage with assigning positive integer values for the lengths $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ a<b $ ) so that the area of the square at the bottom is exactly $ x $ . As a good friend of Pak Chanek, you are asked to help him find the $ N $ -th smallest suitable number.",
