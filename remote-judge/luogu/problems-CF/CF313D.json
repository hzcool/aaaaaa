    "description": "Everything is great about Ilya's city, except the roads. The thing is, the only ZooVille road is represented as $ n $ holes in a row. We will consider the holes numbered from 1 to $ n $ , from left to right.\n\nIlya is really keep on helping his city. So, he wants to fix at least $ k $ holes (perharps he can fix more) on a single ZooVille road.\n\nThe city has $ m $ building companies, the $ i $ -th company needs $ c_{i} $ money units to fix a road segment containing holes with numbers of at least $ l_{i} $ and at most $ r_{i} $ . The companies in ZooVille are very greedy, so, if they fix a segment containing some already fixed holes, they do not decrease the price for fixing the segment.\n\nDetermine the minimum money Ilya will need to fix at least $ k $ holes.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ n,m,k $ $ (1<=n<=300,1<=m<=10^{5},1<=k<=n) $ . The next $ m $ lines contain the companies' description. The $ i $ -th line contains three integers $ l_{i},r_{i},c_{i} $ $ (1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=n,1<=c_{i}<=10^{9}) $ .",
