    "description": "Fox Ciel has a board with $ n $ rows and $ n $ columns. So, the board consists of $ n\u00d7n $ cells. Each cell contains either a symbol '.', or a symbol '\\#'.\n\nA cross on the board is a connected set of exactly five cells of the board that looks like a cross. The picture below shows how it looks.\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF389B/5ccac31668e0d529fa8a5f9e69b4dcfcf1f3b650.png)Ciel wants to draw several (may be zero) crosses on the board. Each cross must cover exactly five cells with symbols '\\#', and any cell with symbol '\\#' must belong to some cross. No two crosses can share a cell.\n\nPlease, tell Ciel if she can draw the crosses in the described way.",
