    "description": "Let's consider an $ n\u00d7n $ square matrix, consisting of digits one and zero.\n\nWe'll consider a matrix good, if it meets the following condition: in each row of the matrix all ones go in one group. That is, each row of the matrix looks like that $ 00...0011...1100...00 $ (or simply consists of zeroes if it has no ones).\n\nYou are given matrix $ a $ of size $ n\u00d7n $ , consisting of zeroes and ones. Your task is to determine whether you can get a good matrix $ b $ from it by rearranging the columns or not.",

    "outputFormat": "Print \"YES\" in the first line, if you can rearrange the matrix columns so as to get a good matrix $ b $ . In the next $ n $ lines print the good matrix $ b $ . If there are multiple answers, you are allowed to print any of them.\n\nIf it is impossible to get a good matrix, print \"NO\".",
