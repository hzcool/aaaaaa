    "description": "While Vasya finished eating his piece of pizza, the lesson has already started. For being late for the lesson, the teacher suggested Vasya to solve one interesting problem. Vasya has an array $ a $ and integer $ x $ . He should find the number of different ordered pairs of indexes $ (i,j) $ such that $ a_{i}<=a_{j} $ and there are exactly $ k $ integers $ y $ such that $ a_{i}<=y<=a_{j} $ and $ y $ is divisible by $ x $ .\n\nIn this problem it is meant that pair $ (i,j) $ is equal to $ (j,i) $ only if $ i $ is equal to $ j $ . For example pair $ (1,2) $ is not the same as $ (2,1) $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains 3 integers $ n,x,k $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5},1<=x<=10^{9},0<=k<=10^{9} $ ), where $ n $ is the size of the array $ a $ and $ x $ and $ k $ are numbers from the statement.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the elements of the array $ a $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Print one integer \u2014 the answer to the problem.",

    "hint": "In first sample there are only three suitable pairs of indexes \u2014 $ (1,2),(2,3),(3,4) $ .\n\nIn second sample there are four suitable pairs of indexes $ (1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4) $ .\n\nIn third sample every pair $ (i,j) $ is suitable, so the answer is $ 5*5=25 $ .",
