    "description": "The Berland language consists of words having exactly two letters. Moreover, the first letter of a word is different from the second letter. Any combination of two different Berland letters (which, by the way, are the same as the lowercase letters of Latin alphabet) is a correct word in Berland language.\n\nThe Berland dictionary contains all words of this language. The words are listed in a way they are usually ordered in dictionaries. Formally, word $ a $ comes earlier than word $ b $ in the dictionary if one of the following conditions hold:\n\n- the first letter of $ a $ is less than the first letter of $ b $ ;\n- the first letters of $ a $ and $ b $ are the same, and the second letter of $ a $ is less than the second letter of $ b $ .\n\nSo, the dictionary looks like that:\n\n- Word $ 1 $ : ab\n- Word $ 2 $ : ac\n- ...\n- Word $ 25 $ : az\n- Word $ 26 $ : ba\n- Word $ 27 $ : bc\n- ...\n- Word $ 649 $ : zx\n- Word $ 650 $ : zy\n\nYou are given a word $ s $ from the Berland language. Your task is to find its index in the dictionary.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 650 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing $ s $ \u2014 a string consisting of exactly two different lowercase Latin letters (i. e. a correct word of the Berland language).",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the index of the word $ s $ in the dictionary.",
