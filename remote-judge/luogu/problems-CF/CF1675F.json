    "description": "Vlad and Nastya live in a city consisting of $ n $ houses and $ n-1 $ road. From each house, you can get to the other by moving only along the roads. That is, the city is a tree.\n\nVlad lives in a house with index $ x $ , and Nastya lives in a house with index $ y $ . Vlad decided to visit Nastya. However, he remembered that he had postponed for later $ k $ things that he has to do before coming to Nastya. To do the $ i $ -th thing, he needs to come to the $ a_i $ -th house, things can be done in any order. In $ 1 $ minute, he can walk from one house to another if they are connected by a road.\n\nVlad does not really like walking, so he is interested what is the minimum number of minutes he has to spend on the road to do all things and then come to Nastya. Houses $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k $ he can visit in any order. He can visit any house multiple times (if he wants).",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of input test cases.
