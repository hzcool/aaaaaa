    "description": "You are given a string $ s $ consisting of the characters '0', '1', and '?'. You need to replace all the characters with '?' in the string $ s $ by '0' or '1' so that the string becomes a palindrome and has exactly $ a $ characters '0' and exactly $ b $ characters '1'. Note that each of the characters '?' is replaced independently from the others.\n\nA string $ t $ of length $ n $ is called a palindrome if the equality $ t[i] = t[n-i+1] $ is true for all $ i $ ( $ 1 \\le i \\le n $ ).\n\nFor example, if $ s= $ \"01?????0\", $ a=4 $ and $ b=4 $ , then you can replace the characters '?' in the following ways:\n\n- \"01011010\";\n- \"01100110\".\n\nFor the given string $ s $ and the numbers $ a $ and $ b $ , replace all the characters with '?' in the string $ s $ by '0' or '1' so that the string becomes a palindrome and has exactly $ a $ characters '0' and exactly $ b $ characters '1'.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ). Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 0 \\le a, b \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ , $ a + b \\ge 1 $ ).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string $ s $ of length $ a+b $ , consisting of the characters '0', '1', and '?'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the string lengths of $ s $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
