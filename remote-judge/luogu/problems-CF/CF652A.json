    "description": "The $ 9 $ -th grade student Gabriel noticed a caterpillar on a tree when walking around in a forest after the classes. The caterpillar was on the height $ h_{1} $ cm from the ground. On the height $ h_{2} $ cm ( $ h_{2}&gt;h_{1} $ ) on the same tree hung an apple and the caterpillar was crawling to the apple.\n\nGabriel is interested when the caterpillar gets the apple. He noted that the caterpillar goes up by $ a $ cm per hour by day and slips down by $ b $ cm per hour by night.\n\nIn how many days Gabriel should return to the forest to see the caterpillar get the apple. You can consider that the day starts at $ 10 $ am and finishes at $ 10 $ pm. Gabriel's classes finish at $ 2 $ pm. You can consider that Gabriel noticed the caterpillar just after the classes at $ 2 $ pm.\n\nNote that the forest is magic so the caterpillar can slip down under the ground and then lift to the apple.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ h_{1},h_{2} $ ( $ 1<=h_{1}&lt;h_{2}<=10^{5} $ ) \u2014 the heights of the position of the caterpillar and the apple in centimeters.\n\nThe second line contains two integers $ a,b $ ( $ 1<=a,b<=10^{5} $ ) \u2014 the distance the caterpillar goes up by day and slips down by night, in centimeters per hour.",
    "outputFormat": "Print the only integer $ k $ \u2014 the number of days Gabriel should wait to return to the forest and see the caterpillar getting the apple.\n\nIf the caterpillar can't get the apple print the only integer $ -1 $ .",
