    "description": "Dima loves making pictures on a piece of squared paper. And yet more than that Dima loves the pictures that depict one of his favorite figures.\n\nA piece of squared paper of size $ n\u00d7m $ is represented by a table, consisting of $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns. All squares are white on blank squared paper. Dima defines a picture as an image on a blank piece of paper, obtained by painting some squares black.\n\nThe picture portrays one of Dima's favorite figures, if the following conditions hold:\n\n- The picture contains at least one painted cell;\n- All painted cells form a connected set, that is, you can get from any painted cell to any other one (you can move from one cell to a side-adjacent one);\n- The minimum number of moves needed to go from the painted cell at coordinates $ (x_{1},y_{1}) $ to the painted cell at coordinates $ (x_{2},y_{2}) $ , moving only through the colored cells, equals $ |x_{1}-x_{2}|+|y_{1}-y_{2}| $ .\n\nNow Dima is wondering: how many paintings are on an $ n\u00d7m $ piece of paper, that depict one of his favorite figures? Count this number modulo $ 1000000007\u00a0(10^{9}+7) $ .",
