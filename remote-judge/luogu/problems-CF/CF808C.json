    "description": "Polycarp invited all his friends to the tea party to celebrate the holiday. He has $ n $ cups, one for each of his $ n $ friends, with volumes $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . His teapot stores $ w $ milliliters of tea ( $ w<=a_{1}+a_{2}+...+a_{n} $ ). Polycarp wants to pour tea in cups in such a way that:\n\n- Every cup will contain tea for at least half of its volume\n- Every cup will contain integer number of milliliters of tea\n- All the tea from the teapot will be poured into cups\n- All friends will be satisfied.\n\nFriend with cup $ i $ won't be satisfied, if there exists such cup $ j $ that cup $ i $ contains less tea than cup $ j $ but $ a_{i}&gt;a_{j} $ .\n\nFor each cup output how many milliliters of tea should be poured in it. If it's impossible to pour all the tea and satisfy all conditions then output -1.",
