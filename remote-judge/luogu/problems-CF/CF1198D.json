    "description": "There is a square grid of size $ n \\times n $ . Some cells are colored in black, all others are colored in white. In one operation you can select some rectangle and color all its cells in white. It costs $ \\max(h, w) $ to color a rectangle of size $ h \\times w $ . You are to make all cells white for minimum total cost.",

The $ j $ -th character of the $ i $ -th line is '\\#' if the cell with coordinates $ (i, j) $ is black, otherwise it is white.",
