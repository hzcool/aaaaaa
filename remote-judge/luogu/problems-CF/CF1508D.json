    "description": "Based on a peculiar incident at basketball practice, Akari came up with the following competitive programming problem!\n\nYou are given $ n $ points on the plane, no three of which are collinear. The $ i $ -th point initially has a label $ a_i $ , in such a way that the labels $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ form a permutation of $ 1, 2, \\dots, n $ .\n\nYou are allowed to modify the labels through the following operation:\n\n1. Choose two distinct integers $ i $ and $ j $ between $ 1 $ and $ n $ .\n2. Swap the labels of points $ i $ and $ j $ , and finally\n3. Draw the segment between points $ i $ and $ j $ .\n\nA sequence of operations is valid if after applying all of the operations in the sequence in order, the $ k $ -th point ends up having the label $ k $ for all $ k $ between $ 1 $ and $ n $ inclusive, and the drawn segments don't intersect each other internally. Formally, if two of the segments intersect, then they must do so at a common endpoint of both segments.\n\nIn particular, all drawn segments must be distinct.\n\nFind any valid sequence of operations, or say that none exist.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 3 \\le n \\le 2000 $ ) \u2014 the number of points.\n\nThe $ i $ -th of the following $ n $ lines contains three integers $ x_i $ , $ y_i $ , $ a_i $ ( $ -10^6 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^6 $ , $ 1 \\le a_i \\le n $ ), representing that the $ i $ -th point has coordinates $ (x_i, y_i) $ and initially has label $ a_i $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that all points are distinct, no three points are collinear, and the labels $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ form a permutation of $ 1, 2, \\dots, n $ .",
    "outputFormat": "If it is impossible to perform a valid sequence of operations, print $ -1 $ .\n\nOtherwise, print an integer $ k $ ( $ 0 \\le k \\le \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2} $ ) \u2014 the number of operations to perform, followed by $ k $ lines, each containing two integers $ i $ and $ j $ ( $ 1 \\le i, j \\le n $ , $ i\\neq j $ ) \u2014 the indices of the points chosen for the operation.\n\nNote that you are not required to minimize or maximize the value of $ k $ .\n\nIf there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.",
