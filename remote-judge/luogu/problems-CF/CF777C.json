    "description": "During the lesson small girl Alyona works with one famous spreadsheet computer program and learns how to edit tables.\n\nNow she has a table filled with integers. The table consists of $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns. By $ a_{i,j} $ we will denote the integer located at the $ i $ -th row and the $ j $ -th column. We say that the table is sorted in non-decreasing order in the column $ j $ if $ a_{i,j}<=a_{i+1,j} $ for all $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n-1 $ .\n\nTeacher gave Alyona $ k $ tasks. For each of the tasks two integers $ l $ and $ r $ are given and Alyona has to answer the following question: if one keeps the rows from $ l $ to $ r $ inclusive and deletes all others, will the table be sorted in non-decreasing order in at least one column? Formally, does there exist such $ j $ that $ a_{i,j}<=a_{i+1,j} $ for all $ i $ from $ l $ to $ r-1 $ inclusive.\n\nAlyona is too small to deal with this task and asks you to help!",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two positive integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n\u00b7m<=100000 $ ) \u2014 the number of rows and the number of columns in the table respectively. Note that your are given a constraint that bound the product of these two integers, i.e. the number of elements in the table.\n\nEach of the following $ n $ lines contains $ m $ integers. The $ j $ -th integers in the $ i $ of these lines stands for $ a_{i,j} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i,j}<=10^{9} $ ).\n\nThe next line of the input contains an integer $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=100000 $ ) \u2014 the number of task that teacher gave to Alyona.\n\nThe $ i $ -th of the next $ k $ lines contains two integers $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=n $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "Print \"Yes\" to the $ i $ -th line of the output if the table consisting of rows from $ l_{i} $ to $ r_{i} $ inclusive is sorted in non-decreasing order in at least one column. Otherwise, print \"No\".",
