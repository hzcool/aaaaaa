    "description": "Vasya is an active Internet user. One day he came across an Internet resource he liked, so he wrote its address in the notebook. We know that the address of the written resource has format:\n\n <protocol>://<domain>.ru\\[/<context>\\]where:\n\n- <protocol> can equal either \"http\" (without the quotes) or \"ftp\" (without the quotes),\n- <domain> is a non-empty string, consisting of lowercase English letters,\n- the /<context> part may not be present. If it is present, then <context> is a non-empty string, consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nIf string <context> isn't present in the address, then the additional character \"/\" isn't written. Thus, the address has either two characters \"/\" (the ones that go before the domain), or three (an extra one in front of the context).\n\nWhen the boy came home, he found out that the address he wrote in his notebook had no punctuation marks. Vasya must have been in a lot of hurry and didn't write characters \":\", \"/\", \".\".\n\nHelp Vasya to restore the possible address of the recorded Internet resource.",
