    "description": "One day Om Nom found a thread with $ n $ beads of different colors. He decided to cut the first several beads from this thread to make a bead necklace and present it to his girlfriend Om Nelly.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF526D/76315fd43cfbe5e147469d75b9c643c18f6f5673.png)Om Nom knows that his girlfriend loves beautiful patterns. That's why he wants the beads on the necklace to form a regular pattern. A sequence of beads $ S $ is regular if it can be represented as $ S=A+B+A+B+A+...+A+B+A $ , where $ A $ and $ B $ are some bead sequences, \" $ + $ \" is the concatenation of sequences, there are exactly $ 2k+1 $ summands in this sum, among which there are $ k+1 $ \" $ A $ \" summands and $ k $ \" $ B $ \" summands that follow in alternating order. Om Nelly knows that her friend is an eager mathematician, so she doesn't mind if $ A $ or $ B $ is an empty sequence.\n\nHelp Om Nom determine in which ways he can cut off the first several beads from the found thread (at least one; probably, all) so that they form a regular pattern. When Om Nom cuts off the beads, he doesn't change their order.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,k<=1000000 $ ) \u2014 the number of beads on the thread that Om Nom found and number $ k $ from the definition of the regular sequence above.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of $ n $ lowercase Latin letters that represent the colors of the beads. Each color corresponds to a single letter.",
    "outputFormat": "Print a string consisting of $ n $ zeroes and ones. Position $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) must contain either number one if the first $ i $ beads on the thread form a regular sequence, or a zero otherwise.",
