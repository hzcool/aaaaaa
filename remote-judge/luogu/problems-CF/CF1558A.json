    "description": "Alice and Borys are playing tennis.\n\nA tennis match consists of games. In each game, one of the players is serving and the other one is receiving.\n\nPlayers serve in turns: after a game where Alice is serving follows a game where Borys is serving, and vice versa.\n\nEach game ends with a victory of one of the players. If a game is won by the serving player, it's said that this player holds serve. If a game is won by the receiving player, it's said that this player breaks serve.\n\nIt is known that Alice won $ a $ games and Borys won $ b $ games during the match. It is unknown who served first and who won which games.\n\nFind all values of $ k $ such that exactly $ k $ breaks could happen during the match between Alice and Borys in total.",
