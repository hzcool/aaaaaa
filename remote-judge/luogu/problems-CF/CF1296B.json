    "description": "Mishka wants to buy some food in the nearby shop. Initially, he has $ s $ burles on his card.\n\nMishka can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose some positive integer number $ 1 \\le x \\le s $ , buy food that costs exactly $ x $ burles and obtain $ \\lfloor\\frac{x}{10}\\rfloor $ burles as a cashback (in other words, Mishka spends $ x $ burles and obtains $ \\lfloor\\frac{x}{10}\\rfloor $ back). The operation $ \\lfloor\\frac{a}{b}\\rfloor $ means $ a $ divided by $ b $ rounded down.\n\nIt is guaranteed that you can always buy some food that costs $ x $ for any possible value of $ x $ .\n\nYour task is to say the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.\n\nFor example, if Mishka has $ s=19 $ burles then the maximum number of burles he can spend is $ 21 $ . Firstly, he can spend $ x=10 $ burles, obtain $ 1 $ burle as a cashback. Now he has $ s=10 $ burles, so can spend $ x=10 $ burles, obtain $ 1 $ burle as a cashback and spend it too.\n\nYou have to answer $ t $ independent test cases.",
