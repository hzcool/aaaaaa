You want to remove some integers in such a way that the resulting sequence of integers satisfies the following three conditions:\n\n1. the resulting sequence is not empty;\n2. the exclusive or ( $ xor $ operation) of all the integers in the resulting sequence equals $ 0 $ ;\n3. if you write all the integers of the resulting sequence (from beginning to the end) in a row in the decimal numeral system and without any spaces, the written number is divisible by $ p $ .\n\nYou are given the sequence of $ n $ integers $ a $ and a prime number $ p $ , find a way to satisfy the described conditions.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ p $ $ (1<=n,p<=50000) $ . Next line contains $ n $ space-separated distinct integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=n) $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that $ p $ is a prime number.",
    "outputFormat": "If there is no solution for the given input, print \"No\" (without quotes) in the only line of the output.\n\nOtherwise print \"Yes\" in the first line of output.
