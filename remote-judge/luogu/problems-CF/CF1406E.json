    "description": "This is an interactive problem.\n\nThere is an unknown integer $ x $ ( $ 1\\le x\\le n $ ). You want to find $ x $ .\n\nAt first, you have a set of integers $ \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\} $ . You can perform the following operations no more than $ 10000 $ times:\n\n- A $ a $ : find how many numbers are multiples of $ a $ in the current set.\n- B $ a $ : find how many numbers are multiples of $ a $ in this set, and then delete all multiples of $ a $ , but $ x $ will never be deleted (even if it is a multiple of $ a $ ). In this operation, $ a $ must be greater than $ 1 $ .\n- C $ a $ : it means that you know that $ x=a $ . This operation can be only performed once.\n\nRemember that in the operation of type B $ a>1 $ must hold.\n\nWrite a program, that will find the value of $ x $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1\\le n\\le 10^5 $ ). The remaining parts of the input will be given throughout the interaction process.",
    "outputFormat": "In each round, your program needs to print a line containing one uppercase letter A, B or C and an integer $ a $ ( $ 1\\le a\\le n $ for operations A and C, $ 2\\le a\\le n $ for operation B). This line desribes operation you make.\n\nIf your operation has type C your program should terminate immediately.\n\nElse your program should read one line containing a single integer, which is the answer to your operation.\n\nAfter outputting each line, don't forget to flush the output. To do it use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C/C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- sys.stdout.flush() in Python;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- See the documentation for other languages.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that the number $ x $ is fixed and won't change during the interaction process.\n\nHacks:\n\nTo make a hack, use such input format:\n\nThe only line should contain two integers $ n $ , $ x $ ( $ 1 \\leq x \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $ ).",

    "hint": "Note that to make the sample more clear, we added extra empty lines. You shouldn't print any extra empty lines during the interaction process.\n\nIn the first test $ n=10 $ and $ x=4 $ .\n\nInitially the set is: $ \\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\\} $ .\n\nIn the first operation, you ask how many numbers are multiples of $ 4 $ and delete them. The answer is $ 2 $ because there are two numbers divisible by $ 4 $ : $ \\{4,8\\} $ . $ 8 $ will be deleted but $ 4 $ won't, because the number $ x $ will never be deleted. Now the set is $ \\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10\\} $ .\n\nIn the second operation, you ask how many numbers are multiples of $ 2 $ . The answer is $ 4 $ because there are four numbers divisible by $ 2 $ : $ \\{2,4,6,10\\} $ .\n\nIn the third operation, you ask how many numbers are multiples of $ 8 $ . The answer is $ 0 $ because there isn't any number divisible by $ 8 $ in the current set.\n\nIn the fourth operation, you know that $ x=4 $ , which is the right answer.",
