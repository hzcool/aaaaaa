    "description": "Stephen Queen wants to write a story. He is a very unusual writer, he uses only letters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' and 'e'!\n\nTo compose a story, Stephen wrote out $ n $ words consisting of the first $ 5 $ lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. He wants to select the maximum number of words to make an interesting story.\n\nLet a story be a sequence of words that are not necessarily different. A story is called interesting if there exists a letter which occurs among all words of the story more times than all other letters together.\n\nFor example, the story consisting of three words \"bac\", \"aaada\", \"e\" is interesting (the letter 'a' occurs $ 5 $ times, all other letters occur $ 4 $ times in total). But the story consisting of two words \"aba\", \"abcde\" is not (no such letter that it occurs more than all other letters in total).\n\nYou are given a sequence of $ n $ words consisting of letters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' and 'e'. Your task is to choose the maximum number of them to make an interesting story. If there's no way to make a non-empty story, output $ 0 $ .",

Then $ n $ lines follow, each of them contains a word \u2014 a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. The words in the sequence may be non-distinct (i. e. duplicates are allowed). Only the letters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' and 'e' may occur in the words.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases doesn't exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ; the sum of the lengths of all words over all test cases doesn't exceed $ 4 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
