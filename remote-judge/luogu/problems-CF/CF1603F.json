    "description": "It was October 18, 2017. Shohag, a melancholic soul, made a strong determination that he will pursue Competitive Programming seriously, by heart, because he found it fascinating. Fast forward to 4 years, he is happy that he took this road. He is now creating a contest on Codeforces. He found an astounding problem but has no idea how to solve this. Help him to solve the final problem of the round.\n\nYou are given three integers $ n $ , $ k $ and $ x $ . Find the number, modulo $ 998\\,244\\,353 $ , of integer sequences $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ such that the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n- $ 0 \\le a_i \\lt 2^k $ for each integer $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .\n- There is no non-empty subsequence in $ a $ such that the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of the elements of the subsequence is $ x $ .\n\nA sequence $ b $ is a subsequence of a sequence $ c $ if $ b $ can be obtained from $ c $ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.",
