    "description": "There are $ n $ piles of pebbles on the table, the $ i $ -th pile contains $ a_{i} $ pebbles. Your task is to paint each pebble using one of the $ k $ given colors so that for each color $ c $ and any two piles $ i $ and $ j $ the difference between the number of pebbles of color $ c $ in pile $ i $ and number of pebbles of color $ c $ in pile $ j $ is at most one.\n\nIn other words, let's say that $ b_{i,c} $ is the number of pebbles of color $ c $ in the $ i $ -th pile. Then for any $ 1<=c<=k $ , $ 1<=i,j<=n $ the following condition must be satisfied $ |b_{i,c}-b_{j,c}|<=1 $ . It isn't necessary to use all $ k $ colors: if color $ c $ hasn't been used in pile $ i $ , then $ b_{i,c} $ is considered to be zero.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains positive integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,k<=100 $ ), separated by a space \u2014 the number of piles and the number of colors respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ positive integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=100 $ ) denoting number of pebbles in each of the piles.",
    "outputFormat": "If there is no way to paint the pebbles satisfying the given condition, output \"NO\" (without quotes) .\n\nOtherwise in the first line output \"YES\" (without quotes). Then $ n $ lines should follow, the $ i $ -th of them should contain $ a_{i} $ space-separated integers. $ j $ -th ( $ 1<=j<=a_{i} $ ) of these integers should be equal to the color of the $ j $ -th pebble in the $ i $ -th pile. If there are several possible answers, you may output any of them.",
