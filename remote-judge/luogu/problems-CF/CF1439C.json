The cost of a meal in the $ i $ -th shop is equal to $ a_i $ .\n\nYou should process $ q $ queries of two types:\n\n- 1 x y: for each shop $ 1 \\leq i \\leq x $ set $ a_{i} = max(a_{i}, y) $ .\n- 2 x y: let's consider a hungry man with $ y $ money. He visits the shops from $ x $ -th shop to $ n $ -th and if he can buy a meal in the current shop he buys one item of it. Find how many meals he will purchase.
