    "description": "Berland is a tourist country! At least, it can become such \u2014 the government of Berland is confident about this.\n\nThere are $ n $ cities in Berland, some pairs of which are connected by two-ways roads. Each road connects two different cities. In Berland there are no roads which connect the same pair of cities. It is possible to get from any city to any other city using given two-ways roads.\n\nAccording to the reform each road will become one-way. It will be oriented to one of two directions.\n\nTo maximize the tourist attraction of Berland, after the reform for each city $ i $ the value $ r_{i} $ will be calculated. It will equal to the number of cities $ x $ for which there is an oriented path from the city $ i $ to the city $ x $ . In other words, $ r_{i} $ will equal the number of cities which can be reached from the city $ i $ by roads.\n\nThe government is sure that tourist's attention will be focused on the minimum value of $ r_{i} $ .\n\nHelp the government of Berland make the reform to maximize the minimum of $ r_{i} $ .",

It is guaranteed that it is possible to get from any city to any other by following two-ways roads. In Berland there are no roads which connect the same pair of cities.",
    "outputFormat": "In the first line print single integer \u2014 the maximum possible value $ min_{1<=i<=n}{r_{i}} $ after the orientation of roads.\n\nThe next $ m $ lines must contain the description of roads after the orientation: the $ j $ -th of them must contain two integers $ u_{j},v_{j} $ , it means that the $ j $ -th road will be directed from the city $ u_{j} $ to the city $ v_{j} $ . Print roads in the same order as they are given in the input data.",
