    "description": "Mark has just purchased a rack of $ n $ lightbulbs. The state of the lightbulbs can be described with binary string $ s = s_1s_2\\dots s_n $ , where $ s_i=\\texttt{1} $ means that the $ i $ -th lightbulb is turned on, while $ s_i=\\texttt{0} $ means that the $ i $ -th lightbulb is turned off.\n\nUnfortunately, the lightbulbs are broken, and the only operation he can perform to change the state of the lightbulbs is the following:\n\n- Select an index $ i $ from $ 2,3,\\dots,n-1 $ such that $ s_{i-1}\\ne s_{i+1} $ .\n- Toggle $ s_i $ . Namely, if $ s_i $ is $ \\texttt{0} $ , set $ s_i $ to $ \\texttt{1} $ or vice versa.\n\nMark wants the state of the lightbulbs to be another binary string $ t $ . Help Mark determine the minimum number of operations to do so.",
