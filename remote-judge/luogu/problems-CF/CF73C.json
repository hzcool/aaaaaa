    "description": "Vasya plays the LionAge II. He was bored of playing with a stupid computer, so he installed this popular MMORPG, to fight with his friends. Vasya came up with the name of his character \u2014 non-empty string $ s $ , consisting of a lowercase Latin letters. However, in order not to put up a front of friends, Vasya has decided to change no more than $ k $ letters of the character name so that the new name sounded as good as possible. Euphony of the line is defined as follows: for each pair of adjacent letters $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ x $ immediately precedes $ y $ ) the bonus $ c(x,y) $ is added to the result. Your task is to determine what the greatest Euphony can be obtained by changing at most $ k $ letters in the name of the Vasya's character.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains character's name $ s $ and an integer number $ k $ ( $ 0<=k<=100 $ ). The length of the nonempty string $ s $ does not exceed $ 100 $ . The second line contains an integer number $ n $ ( $ 0<=n<=676 $ ) \u2014 amount of pairs of letters, giving bonus to the euphony. The next $ n $ lines contain description of these pairs \u00ab $ x $ $ y $ $ c $ \u00bb, which means that sequence $ xy $ gives bonus $ c $ ( $ x,y $ \u2014 lowercase Latin letters, $ -1000<=c<=1000) $ . It is guaranteed that no pair $ x $ $ y $ mentioned twice in the input data.",
    "outputFormat": "Output the only number \u2014 maximum possible euphony \u043ef the new character's name.",
