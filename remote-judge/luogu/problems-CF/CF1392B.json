    "description": "Being stuck at home, Ray became extremely bored. To pass time, he asks Lord Omkar to use his time bending power: Infinity Clock! However, Lord Omkar will only listen to mortals who can solve the following problem:\n\nYou are given an array $ a $ of $ n $ integers. You are also given an integer $ k $ . Lord Omkar wants you to do $ k $ operations with this array.\n\nDefine one operation as the following:\n\n1. Set $ d $ to be the maximum value of your array.\n2. For every $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , replace $ a_{i} $ with $ d-a_{i} $ .\n\nThe goal is to predict the contents in the array after $ k $ operations. Please help Ray determine what the final sequence will look like!",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 100 $ ). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\leq k \\leq       10^{18} $ ) \u2013 the length of your array and the number of operations to perform.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (-10^9 \\leq a_{i} \\leq 10^9) $ \u2013 the initial contents of your array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
