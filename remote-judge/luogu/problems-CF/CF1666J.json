    "description": "Julia's $ n $ friends want to organize a startup in a new country they moved to. They assigned each other numbers from 1 to $ n $ according to the jobs they have, from the most front-end tasks to the most back-end ones. They also estimated a matrix $ c $ , where $ c_{ij} = c_{ji} $ is the average number of messages per month between people doing jobs $ i $ and $ j $ .\n\nNow they want to make a hierarchy tree. It will be a binary tree with each node containing one member of the team. Some member will be selected as a leader of the team and will be contained in the root node. In order for the leader to be able to easily reach any subordinate, for each node $ v $ of the tree, the following should apply: all members in its left subtree must have smaller numbers than $ v $ , and all members in its right subtree must have larger numbers than $ v $ .\n\nAfter the hierarchy tree is settled, people doing jobs $ i $ and $ j $ will be communicating via the shortest path in the tree between their nodes. Let's denote the length of this path as $ d_{ij} $ . Thus, the cost of their communication is $ c_{ij} \\cdot d_{ij} $ .\n\nYour task is to find a hierarchy tree that minimizes the total cost of communication over all pairs: $ \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le n} c_{ij} \\cdot d_{ij} $ .",

To do so, for each team member from 1 to $ n $ output the number of the member in its parent node, or 0 for the leader. If there are many optimal trees, output a description of any one of them.",
