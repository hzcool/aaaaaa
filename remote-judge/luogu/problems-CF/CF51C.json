    "description": "The New Vasjuki village is stretched along the motorway and that's why every house on it is characterized by its shift relative to some fixed point \u2014 the $ x_{i} $ coordinate. The village consists of $ n $ houses, the $ i $ -th house is located in the point with coordinates of $ x_{i} $ .\n\nTELE3, a cellular communication provider planned to locate three base stations so as to provide every house in the village with cellular communication. The base station having power $ d $ located in the point $ t $ provides with communication all the houses on the segment $ [t-d,t+d] $ (including boundaries).\n\nTo simplify the integration (and simply not to mix anything up) all the three stations are planned to possess the equal power of $ d $ . Which minimal value of $ d $ is enough to provide all the houses in the village with cellular communication.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2\u00b710^{5} $ ) which represents the number of houses in the village. The second line contains the coordinates of houses \u2014 the sequence $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n} $ of integer numbers ( $ 1<=x_{i}<=10^{9} $ ). It is possible that two or more houses are located on one point. The coordinates are given in a arbitrary order.",
    "outputFormat": "Print the required minimal power $ d $ . In the second line print three numbers \u2014 the possible coordinates of the base stations' location. Print the coordinates with 6 digits after the decimal point. The positions of the stations can be any from $ 0 $ to $ 2\u00b710^{9} $ inclusively. It is accepted for the base stations to have matching coordinates. If there are many solutions, print any of them.",
