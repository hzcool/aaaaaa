    "description": "On a history lesson the teacher asked Vasya to name the dates when $ n $ famous events took place. He doesn't remembers the exact dates but he remembers a segment of days $ [l_{i},r_{i}] $ (inclusive) on which the event could have taken place. However Vasya also remembers that there was at most one event in one day. Help him choose such $ n $ dates of famous events that will fulfill both conditions. It is guaranteed that it is possible.",

Then follow $ n $ lines containing two integers $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ each ( $ 1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=10^{7} $ ) \u2014 the earliest acceptable date and the latest acceptable date of the $ i $ -th event.",
