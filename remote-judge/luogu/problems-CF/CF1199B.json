    "description": "While sailing on a boat, Inessa noticed a beautiful water lily flower above the lake's surface. She came closer and it turned out that the lily was exactly $ H $ centimeters above the water surface. Inessa grabbed the flower and sailed the distance of $ L $ centimeters. Exactly at this point the flower touched the water surface.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1199B/42f6cea9c2bcade7ac8750d98129857158bca8c3.png)Suppose that the lily grows at some point $ A $ on the lake bottom, and its stem is always a straight segment with one endpoint at point $ A $ . Also suppose that initially the flower was exactly above the point $ A $ , i.e. its stem was vertical. Can you determine the depth of the lake at point $ A $ ?",
