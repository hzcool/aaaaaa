    "description": "New Year is coming! Vasya has prepared a New Year's verse and wants to recite it in front of Santa Claus.\n\nVasya's verse contains $ n $ parts. It takes $ a_i $ seconds to recite the $ i $ -th part. Vasya can't change the order of parts in the verse: firstly he recites the part which takes $ a_1 $ seconds, secondly \u2014 the part which takes $ a_2 $ seconds, and so on. After reciting the verse, Vasya will get the number of presents equal to the number of parts he fully recited.\n\nVasya can skip at most one part of the verse while reciting it (if he skips more than one part, then Santa will definitely notice it).\n\nSanta will listen to Vasya's verse for no more than $ s $ seconds. For example, if $ s = 10 $ , $ a = [100, 9, 1, 1] $ , and Vasya skips the first part of verse, then he gets two presents.\n\nNote that it is possible to recite the whole verse (if there is enough time).\n\nDetermine which part Vasya needs to skip to obtain the maximum possible number of gifts. If Vasya shouldn't skip anything, print 0. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nYou have to process $ t $ test cases.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ s $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 10^5, 1 \\le s \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the number of parts in the verse and the maximum number of seconds Santa will listen to Vasya, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the time it takes to recite each part of the verse.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
