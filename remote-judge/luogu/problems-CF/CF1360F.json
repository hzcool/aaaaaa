    "description": "You are given $ n $ strings $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ : all of them have the same length $ m $ . The strings consist of lowercase English letters.\n\nFind any string $ s $ of length $ m $ such that each of the given $ n $ strings differs from $ s $ in at most one position. Formally, for each given string $ a_i $ , there is no more than one position $ j $ such that $ a_i[j] \\ne s[j] $ .\n\nNote that the desired string $ s $ may be equal to one of the given strings $ a_i $ , or it may differ from all the given strings.\n\nFor example, if you have the strings abac and zbab, then the answer to the problem might be the string abab, which differs from the first only by the last character, and from the second only by the first.",
