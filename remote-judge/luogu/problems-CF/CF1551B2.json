    "description": "This problem is an extension of the problem \"Wonderful Coloring - 1\". It has quite many differences, so you should read this statement completely.\n\nRecently, Paul and Mary have found a new favorite sequence of integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ . They want to paint it using pieces of chalk of $ k $ colors. The coloring of a sequence is called wonderful if the following conditions are met:\n\n1. each element of the sequence is either painted in one of $ k $ colors or isn't painted;\n2. each two elements which are painted in the same color are different (i. e. there's no two equal values painted in the same color);\n3. let's calculate for each of $ k $ colors the number of elements painted in the color \u2014 all calculated numbers must be equal;\n4. the total number of painted elements of the sequence is the maximum among all colorings of the sequence which meet the first three conditions.\n\nE. g. consider a sequence $ a=[3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 10, 3, 10, 10, 2] $ and $ k=3 $ . One of the wonderful colorings of the sequence is shown in the figure.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1551B2/dbd09f59a345c41308d3382019b949ebfdfed535.png)The example of a wonderful coloring of the sequence $ a=[3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 10, 3, 10, 10, 2] $ and $ k=3 $ . Note that one of the elements isn't painted.Help Paul and Mary to find a wonderful coloring of a given sequence $ a $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10000 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines. The first one contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5 $ , $ 1 \\le k \\le n $ ) \u2014 the length of a given sequence and the number of colors, respectively. The second one contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le n $ ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases doesn't exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Output $ t $ lines, each of them must contain a description of a wonderful coloring for the corresponding test case.\n\nEach wonderful coloring must be printed as a sequence of $ n $ integers $ c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n $ ( $ 0 \\le c_i \\le k $ ) separated by spaces where\n\n- $ c_i=0 $ , if $ i $ -th element isn't painted;\n- $ c_i>0 $ , if $ i $ -th element is painted in the $ c_i $ -th color.\n\nRemember that you need to maximize the total count of painted elements for the wonderful coloring.
