    "description": "Dasha is fond of challenging puzzles: Rubik's Cube $ 3\u00d73\u00d73 $ , $ 4\u00d74\u00d74 $ , $ 5\u00d75\u00d75 $ and so on. This time she has a cyclic table of size $ n\u00d7m $ , and each cell of the table contains a lowercase English letter. Each cell has coordinates $ (i,j) $ ( $ 0<=i&lt;n $ , $ 0<=j&lt;m $ ). The table is cyclic means that to the right of cell $ (i,j) $ there is the cell ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF754E/a5d005af310d530b73654f2e5c374c68f16d2ee4.png), and to the down there is the cell ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF754E/1a381522c9ac4a424562398196989e9e4585022e.png).\n\nDasha has a pattern as well. A pattern is a non-cyclic table of size $ r\u00d7c $ . Each cell is either a lowercase English letter or a question mark. Each cell has coordinates $ (i,j) $ ( $ 0<=i&lt;r $ , $ 0<=j&lt;c $ ).\n\nThe goal of the puzzle is to find all the appearance positions of the pattern in the cyclic table.\n\nWe say that the cell $ (i,j) $ of cyclic table is an appearance position, if for every pair $ (x,y) $ such that $ 0<=x&lt;r $ and $ 0<=y&lt;c $ one of the following conditions holds:\n\n- There is a question mark in the cell $ (x,y) $ of the pattern, or\n- The cell ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF754E/54ce001d702da711f4c8fe98e24e25993cb660d2.png) of the cyclic table equals to the cell $ (x,y) $ of the pattern.\n\nDasha solved this puzzle in no time, as well as all the others she ever tried. Can you solve it?.",
