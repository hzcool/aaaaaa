    "description": "After a drawn-out mooclear arms race, Farmer John and the Mischievous Mess Makers have finally agreed to establish peace. They plan to divide the territory of Bovinia with a line passing through at least two of the $ n $ outposts scattered throughout the land. These outposts, remnants of the conflict, are located at the points $ (x_{1},y_{1}),(x_{2},y_{2}),...,(x_{n},y_{n}) $ .\n\nIn order to find the optimal dividing line, Farmer John and Elsie have plotted a map of Bovinia on the coordinate plane. Farmer John's farm and the Mischievous Mess Makers' base are located at the points $ P=(a,0) $ and $ Q=(-a,0) $ , respectively. Because they seek a lasting peace, Farmer John and Elsie would like to minimize the maximum difference between the distances from any point on the line to $ P $ and $ Q $ .\n\nFormally, define the difference of a line ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF645G/2753c32f9c54ae7cab12385d23f18081312044d2.png) relative to two points $ P $ and $ Q $ as the smallest real number $ d $ so that for all points $ X $ on line ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF645G/2753c32f9c54ae7cab12385d23f18081312044d2.png), $ |PX-QX|<=d $ .
