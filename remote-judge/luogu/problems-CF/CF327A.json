    "description": "Iahub got bored, so he invented a game to be played on paper.\n\nHe writes $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . Each of those integers can be either 0 or 1. He's allowed to do exactly one move: he chooses two indices $ i $ and $ j $ ( $ 1<=i<=j<=n $ ) and flips all values $ a_{k} $ for which their positions are in range $ [i,j] $ (that is $ i<=k<=j $ ). Flip the value of $ x $ means to apply operation $ x=1 $ - $ x $ .\n\nThe goal of the game is that after exactly one move to obtain the maximum number of ones. Write a program to solve the little game of Iahub.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ). In the second line of the input there are $ n $ integers: $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . It is guaranteed that each of those $ n $ values is either 0 or 1.",

    "hint": "In the first case, flip the segment from 2 to 5 $ (i=2,j=5) $ . That flip changes the sequence, it becomes: \\[1 1 1 0 1\\]. So, it contains four ones. There is no way to make the whole sequence equal to \\[1 1 1 1 1\\].\n\nIn the second case, flipping only the second and the third element $ (i=2,j=3) $ will turn all numbers into 1.",
