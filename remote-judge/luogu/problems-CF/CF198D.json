Your task is to number all unit cubes in this cube with positive integers from $ 1 $ to $ n^{3} $ so that:\n\n- each number was used as a cube's number exactly once;\n- for each $ 1<=i&lt;n^{3} $ , unit cubes with numbers $ i $ and $ i+1 $ were neighbouring (that is, shared a side);\n- for each $ 1<=i&lt;n $ there were at least two different subcubes with sizes $ i\u00d7i\u00d7i $ , made from unit cubes, which are numbered with consecutive numbers. That is, there are such two numbers $ x $ and $ y $ , that the unit cubes of the first subcube are numbered by numbers $ x $ , $ x+1 $ , $ ... $ , $ x+i^{3}-1 $ , and the unit cubes of the second subcube are numbered by numbers $ y $ , $ y+1 $ , $ ... $ , $ y+i^{3}-1 $ .\n\nFind and print the required numeration of unit cubes of the cube.",
