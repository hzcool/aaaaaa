    "description": "You are given a sequence of $ n $ digits $ d_1d_2 \\dots d_{n} $ . You need to paint all the digits in two colors so that:\n\n- each digit is painted either in the color $ 1 $ or in the color $ 2 $ ;\n- if you write in a row from left to right all the digits painted in the color $ 1 $ , and then after them all the digits painted in the color $ 2 $ , then the resulting sequence of $ n $ digits will be non-decreasing (that is, each next digit will be greater than or equal to the previous digit).\n\nFor example, for the sequence $ d=914 $ the only valid coloring is $ 211 $ (paint in the color $ 1 $ two last digits, paint in the color $ 2 $ the first digit). But $ 122 $ is not a valid coloring ( $ 9 $ concatenated with $ 14 $ is not a non-decreasing sequence).\n\nIt is allowed that either of the two colors is not used at all. Digits painted in the same color are not required to have consecutive positions.\n\nFind any of the valid ways to paint the given sequence of digits or determine that it is impossible to do.",

The digits are written in a row without spaces or any other separators. The sequence can start with 0.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values \u200b\u200bof $ n $ for all test cases in the input does not exceed $ 2\\cdot10^5 $ .",
