    "description": "Famil Door wants to celebrate his birthday with his friends from Far Far Away. He has $ n $ friends and each of them can come to the party in a specific range of days of the year from $ a_{i} $ to $ b_{i} $ . Of course, Famil Door wants to have as many friends celebrating together with him as possible.\n\nFar cars are as weird as Far Far Away citizens, so they can only carry two people of opposite gender, that is exactly one male and one female. However, Far is so far from here that no other transportation may be used to get to the party.\n\nFamil Door should select some day of the year and invite some of his friends, such that they all are available at this moment and the number of male friends invited is equal to the number of female friends invited. Find the maximum number of friends that may present at the party.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=5000 $ ) \u2014 then number of Famil Door's friends.\n\nThen follow $ n $ lines, that describe the friends. Each line starts with a capital letter 'F' for female friends and with a capital letter 'M' for male friends. Then follow two integers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=b_{i}<=366 $ ), providing that the $ i $ -th friend can come to the party from day $ a_{i} $ to day $ b_{i} $ inclusive.",
