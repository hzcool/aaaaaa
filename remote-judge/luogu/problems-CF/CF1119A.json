    "description": "Ilya lives in a beautiful city of Chordalsk.\n\nThere are $ n $ houses on the street Ilya lives, they are numerated from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from left to right; the distance between every two neighboring houses is equal to $ 1 $ unit. The neighboring houses are $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ , ..., $ n-1 $ and $ n $ . The houses $ n $ and $ 1 $ are not neighboring.\n\nThe houses are colored in colors $ c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n $ so that the $ i $ -th house is colored in the color $ c_i $ . Everyone knows that Chordalsk is not boring, so there are at least two houses colored in different colors.\n\nIlya wants to select two houses $ i $ and $ j $ so that $ 1 \\leq i < j \\leq n $ , and they have different colors: $ c_i \\neq c_j $ . He will then walk from the house $ i $ to the house $ j $ the distance of $ (j-i) $ units.\n\nIlya loves long walks, so he wants to choose the houses so that the distance between them is the maximum possible.\n\nHelp Ilya, find this maximum possible distance.",
