    "hint": "In the first testcase, all cells are isolated. A knight can't move from any cell of the board to any other one. Thus, any cell on board is a correct answer.\n\nIn the second testcase, there are no isolated cells. On a normal chess board, a knight has at least two moves from any cell. Thus, again, any cell is a correct answer.\n\nIn the third testcase, only the middle cell of the board is isolated. The knight can move freely around the border of the board, but can't escape the middle.",
