    "description": "Vanya invented an interesting trick with a set of integers.\n\nLet an illusionist have a set of positive integers $ S $ . He names a positive integer $ x $ . Then an audience volunteer must choose some subset (possibly, empty) of $ S $ without disclosing it to the illusionist. The volunteer tells the illusionist the size of the chosen subset. And here comes the trick: the illusionist guesses whether the sum of the subset elements does not exceed $ x $ . The sum of elements of an empty subset is considered to be $ 0 $ .\n\nVanya wants to prepare the trick for a public performance. He prepared some set of distinct positive integers $ S $ . Vasya wants the trick to be successful. He calls a positive number $ x $ unsuitable, if he can't be sure that the trick would be successful for every subset a viewer can choose.\n\nVanya wants to count the number of unsuitable integers for the chosen set $ S $ .\n\nVanya plans to try different sets $ S $ . He wants you to write a program that finds the number of unsuitable integers for the initial set $ S $ , and after each change to the set $ S $ . Vanya will make $ q $ changes to the set, and each change is one of the following two types:\n\n- add a new integer $ a $ to the set $ S $ , or\n- remove some integer $ a $ from the set $ S $ .",

    "hint": "In the first example the initial set is $ S = \\{1, 2, 3\\} $ . For this set the trick can be unsuccessful for $ x \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} $ . For example, if $ x = 4 $ , the volunteer can choose the subset $ \\{1, 2\\} $ with sum $ 3 \\leq x $ , and can choose the subset $ \\{2, 3\\} $ with sum $ 5 > x $ . However, in both cases the illusionist only know the same size of the subset ( $ 2 $ ), so he can't be sure answering making a guess. Since there is only one subset of size $ 3 $ , and the sum of each subset of smaller size does not exceed $ 5 $ , all $ x \\ge 5 $ are suitable.",
