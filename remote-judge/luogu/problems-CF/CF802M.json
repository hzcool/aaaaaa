    "description": "The marmots have prepared a very easy problem for this year's HC $ ^{2} $ \u2013 this one. It involves numbers $ n $ , $ k $ and a sequence of $ n $ positive integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . They also came up with a beautiful and riveting story for the problem statement. It explains what the input means, what the program should output, and it also reads like a good criminal.\n\nHowever I, Heidi, will have none of that. As my joke for today, I am removing the story from the statement and replacing it with these two unhelpful paragraphs. Now solve the problem, fools!",
