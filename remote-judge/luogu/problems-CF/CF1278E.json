    "description": "We had a really tough time generating tests for problem D. In order to prepare strong tests, we had to solve the following problem.\n\nGiven an undirected labeled tree consisting of $ n $ vertices, find a set of segments such that:\n\n1. both endpoints of each segment are integers from $ 1 $ to $ 2n $ , and each integer from $ 1 $ to $ 2n $ should appear as an endpoint of exactly one segment;\n2. all segments are non-degenerate;\n3. for each pair $ (i, j) $ such that $ i \\ne j $ , $ i \\in [1, n] $ and $ j \\in [1, n] $ , the vertices $ i $ and $ j $ are connected with an edge if and only if the segments $ i $ and $ j $ intersect, but neither segment $ i $ is fully contained in segment $ j $ , nor segment $ j $ is fully contained in segment $ i $ .\n\nCan you solve this problem too?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThen $ n - 1 $ lines follow, each containing two integers $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ ( $ 1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n $ , $ x_i \\ne y_i $ ) denoting the endpoints of the $ i $ -th edge.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.",
    "outputFormat": "Print $ n $ pairs of integers, the $ i $ -th pair should contain two integers $ l_i $ and $ r_i $ ( $ 1 \\le l_i < r_i \\le 2n $ ) \u2014 the endpoints of the $ i $ -th segment. All $ 2n $ integers you print should be unique.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the answer always exists.",
