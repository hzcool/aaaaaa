We call component a set of cells with same numbers and between any pair of cells from that set there exists a path through adjacent cells from same component. Here is the example of the partitioning some flag matrix into components:\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF811E/9c3d5d03c8614a33f231cd8f8efd0e706383885b.png)But this time he decided to change something in the process. Now he wants to estimate not the entire flag, but some segment. Segment of flag can be described as a submatrix of the flag matrix with opposite corners at $ (1,l) $ and $ (n,r) $ , where conditions $ 1<=l<=r<=m $ are satisfied.\n\nHelp Vladik to calculate the beauty for some segments of the given flag.",
