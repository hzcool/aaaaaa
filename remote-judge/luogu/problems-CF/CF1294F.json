    "description": "You are given an unweighted tree with $ n $ vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.\n\nYour task is to choose three distinct vertices $ a, b, c $ on this tree such that the number of edges which belong to at least one of the simple paths between $ a $ and $ b $ , $ b $ and $ c $ , or $ a $ and $ c $ is the maximum possible. See the notes section for a better understanding.\n\nThe simple path is the path that visits each vertex at most once.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer number $ n $ ( $ 3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nNext $ n - 1 $ lines describe the edges of the tree in form $ a_i, b_i $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i $ , $ b_i \\le n $ , $ a_i \\ne b_i $ ). It is guaranteed that given graph is a tree.",

The union of these paths is $ (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6) $ so the answer is $ 5 $ . It can be shown that there is no better answer.",
