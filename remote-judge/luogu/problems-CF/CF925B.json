    "description": "One department of some software company has $ n $ servers of different specifications. Servers are indexed with consecutive integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Suppose that the specifications of the $ j $ -th server may be expressed with a single integer number $ c_j $ of artificial resource units.\n\nIn order for production to work, it is needed to deploy two services $ S_1 $ and $ S_2 $ to process incoming requests using the servers of the department. Processing of incoming requests of service $ S_i $ takes $ x_i $ resource units.\n\nThe described situation happens in an advanced company, that is why each service may be deployed using not only one server, but several servers simultaneously. If service $ S_i $ is deployed using $ k_i $ servers, then the load is divided equally between these servers and each server requires only $ x_i / k_i $ (that may be a fractional number) resource units.\n\nEach server may be left unused at all, or be used for deploying exactly one of the services (but not for two of them simultaneously). The service should not use more resources than the server provides.\n\nDetermine if it is possible to deploy both services using the given servers, and if yes, determine which servers should be used for deploying each of the services.",

    "outputFormat": "If it is impossible to deploy both services using the given servers, print the only word \"No\" (without the quotes).\n\nOtherwise print the word \"Yes\" (without the quotes).\n\nIn the second line print two integers $ k_1 $ and $ k_2 $ ( $ 1 \\leq k_1, k_2 \\leq n $ ) \u2014 the number of servers used for each of the services.\n\nIn the third line print $ k_1 $ integers, the indices of the servers that will be used for the first service.\n\nIn the fourth line print $ k_2 $ integers, the indices of the servers that will be used for the second service.\n\nNo index may appear twice among the indices you print in the last two lines. If there are several possible answers, it is allowed to print any of them.",
