    "description": "It's marriage season in Ringland!\n\nRingland has a form of a circle's boundary of length $ L $ . There are $ n $ bridegrooms and $ n $ brides, and bridegrooms decided to marry brides.\n\nOf course, each bridegroom should choose exactly one bride, and each bride should be chosen by exactly one bridegroom.\n\nAll objects in Ringland are located on the boundary of the circle, including the capital, bridegrooms' castles and brides' palaces. The castle of the $ i $ -th bridegroom is located at the distance $ a_i $ from the capital in clockwise direction, and the palace of the $ i $ -th bride is located at the distance $ b_i $ from the capital in clockwise direction.\n\nLet's define the inconvenience of a marriage the maximum distance that some bride should walk along the circle from her palace to her bridegroom's castle in the shortest direction (in clockwise or counter-clockwise direction).\n\nHelp the bridegrooms of Ringland to choose brides in such a way that the inconvenience of the marriage is the smallest possible.",
