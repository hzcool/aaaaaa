    "description": "You are given an array $ a $ of $ n $ positive integers. Determine if, by rearranging the elements, you can make the array strictly increasing. In other words, determine if it is possible to rearrange the elements such that $ a_1 < a_2 < \\dots < a_n $ holds.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 100 $ ) \u2014 the length of the array.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_i $ ( $ 1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the elements of the array.",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if the array satisfies the condition, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).",
