    "description": "Karl likes Codeforces and subsequences. He wants to find a string of lowercase English letters that contains at least $ k $ subsequences codeforces. Out of all possible strings, Karl wants to find a shortest one.\n\nFormally, a codeforces subsequence of a string $ s $ is a subset of ten characters of $ s $ that read codeforces from left to right. For example, codeforces contains codeforces a single time, while codeforcesisawesome contains codeforces four times:  codeforcesisawesome,  codeforcesisawesome,  codeforcesisawesome,  codeforcesisawesome.\n\nHelp Karl find any shortest string that contains at least $ k $ codeforces subsequences.",
