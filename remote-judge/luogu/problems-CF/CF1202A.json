    "description": "You are given two binary strings $ x $ and $ y $ , which are binary representations of some two integers (let's denote these integers as $ f(x) $ and $ f(y) $ ). You can choose any integer $ k \\ge 0 $ , calculate the expression $ s_k = f(x) + f(y) \\cdot 2^k $ and write the binary representation of $ s_k $ in reverse order (let's denote it as $ rev_k $ ). For example, let $ x = 1010 $ and $ y = 11 $ ; you've chosen $ k = 1 $ and, since $ 2^1 = 10_2 $ , so $ s_k = 1010_2 + 11_2 \\cdot 10_2 = 10000_2 $ and $ rev_k = 00001 $ .\n\nFor given $ x $ and $ y $ , you need to choose such $ k $ that $ rev_k $ is lexicographically minimal (read notes if you don't know what does \"lexicographically\" means).\n\nIt's guaranteed that, with given constraints, $ k $ exists and is finite.",

    "hint": "The first query was described in the legend.\n\nIn the second query, it's optimal to choose $ k = 3 $ . The $ 2^3 = 1000_2 $ so $ s_3 = 10001_2 + 110_2 \\cdot 1000_2 = 10001 + 110000 = 1000001 $ and $ rev_3 = 1000001 $ . For example, if $ k = 0 $ , then $ s_0 = 10111 $ and $ rev_0 = 11101 $ , but $ rev_3 = 1000001 $ is lexicographically smaller than $ rev_0 = 11101 $ .\n\nIn the third query $ s_0 = 10 $ and $ rev_0 = 01 $ . For example, $ s_2 = 101 $ and $ rev_2 = 101 $ . And $ 01 $ is lexicographically smaller than $ 101 $ .\n\nThe quote from Wikipedia: \"To determine which of two strings of characters comes when arranging in lexicographical order, their first letters are compared. If they differ, then the string whose first letter comes earlier in the alphabet comes before the other string. If the first letters are the same, then the second letters are compared, and so on. If a position is reached where one string has no more letters to compare while the other does, then the first (shorter) string is deemed to come first in alphabetical order.\"",
