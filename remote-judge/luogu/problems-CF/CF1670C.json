    "description": "While searching for the pizza, baby Hosssam came across two permutations $ a $ and $ b $ of length $ n $ .\n\nRecall that a permutation is an array consisting of $ n $ distinct integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in arbitrary order. For example, $ [2,3,1,5,4] $ is a permutation, but $ [1,2,2] $ is not a permutation ( $ 2 $ appears twice in the array) and $ [1,3,4] $ is also not a permutation ( $ n=3 $ but there is $ 4 $ in the array).\n\nBaby Hosssam forgot about the pizza and started playing around with the two permutations. While he was playing with them, some elements of the first permutation got mixed up with some elements of the second permutation, and to his surprise those elements also formed a permutation of size $ n $ .\n\nSpecifically, he mixed up the permutations to form a new array $ c $ in the following way.\n\n- For each $ i $ ( $ 1\\le i\\le n $ ), he either made $ c_i=a_i $ or $ c_i=b_i $ .\n- The array $ c $ is a permutation.\n\nYou know permutations $ a $ , $ b $ , and values at some positions in $ c $ . Please count the number different permutations $ c $ that are consistent with the described process and the given values. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo $ 10^9+7 $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that there exists at least one permutation $ c $ that satisfies all the requirements.",
