    "description": "You are given $ n $ pairwise non-collinear two-dimensional vectors. You can make shapes in the two-dimensional plane with these vectors in the following fashion:\n\n1. Start at the origin $ (0, 0) $ .\n2. Choose a vector and add the segment of the vector to the current point. For example, if your current point is at $ (x, y) $ and you choose the vector $ (u, v) $ , draw a segment from your current point to the point at $ (x + u, y + v) $ and set your current point to $ (x + u, y + v) $ .\n3. Repeat step 2 until you reach the origin again.\n\nYou can reuse a vector as many times as you want.\n\nCount the number of different, non-degenerate (with an area greater than $ 0 $ ) and convex shapes made from applying the steps, such that the shape can be contained within a $ m \\times m $ square. Since this number can be too large, you should calculate it by modulo $ 998244353 $ .\n\nTwo shapes are considered the same if there exists some parallel translation of the first shape to another.\n\nA shape can be contained within a $ m \\times m $ square if there exists some parallel translation of this shape so that every point $ (u, v) $ inside or on the border of the shape satisfies $ 0 \\leq u, v \\leq m $ .",
