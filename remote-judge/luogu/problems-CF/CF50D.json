    "description": "The commanding officers decided to drop a nuclear bomb on the enemy's forces. You are ordered to determine the power of the warhead that needs to be used.\n\nThe enemy has $ N $ strategically important objects. Their positions are known due to the intelligence service. The aim of the strike is to deactivate at least $ K $ important objects of the enemy. The bombing impact point is already determined and has coordinates of $ [X_{0};\\ Y_{0}] $ .\n\nThe nuclear warhead is marked by the estimated impact radius $ R>=0 $ . All the buildings that are located closer than $ R $ to the bombing epicentre will be destroyed. All the buildings that are located further than $ R $ from the epicentre, can also be deactivated with some degree of probability. Let's assume that $ D $ is the distance between a building and the epicentre. This building's deactivation probability $ P(D,R) $ is calculated according to the following formula:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF50D/711e1c419c06d4e6b9f16e86aeb94f1d25925635.png) We should regard ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF50D/5966d57c740e5c247c71ce7e978aac36c0d9200d.png) as $ e^{a} $ , where $ e\u22482.7182818284590452353602874713527 $ If the estimated impact radius of the warhead is equal to zero, then all the buildings located in the impact point will be completely demolished and all the rest of important objects will not be damaged.\n\nThe commanding officers want the probability of failing the task to be no more than $ \u03b5 $ . Nuclear warheads are too expensive a luxury, that's why you have to minimise the estimated impact radius of the warhead.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $ N $ which represents the number of the enemy's objects ( $ 1<=N<=100 $ ). The second line contains two integers: $ K $ is the required number of deactivated objects, and $ \u03b5 $ is the maximally permitted probability of not completing the task, given in per mils ( $ 1<=K<=N $ , $ 1<=\u03b5<=999 $ ). The third line contains $ X_{0} $ and $ Y_{0} $ which are the coordinates of the strike impact point. The next $ N $ lines contain two numbers $ X_{i} $ and $ Y_{i} $ each which are the coordinates of every strategically important object. All the coordinates are integer, their absolute values do not exceed $ 1000 $ .\n\nLet us remind you that there are a thousand per mils in unity (number one).\n\nThere can be several objects in one point.",
