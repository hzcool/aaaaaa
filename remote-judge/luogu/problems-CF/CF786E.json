    "description": "ALT is a planet in a galaxy called \"Encore\". Humans rule this planet but for some reason there's no dog in their planet, so the people there are sad and depressed. Rick and Morty are universal philanthropists and they want to make people in ALT happy.\n\nALT has $ n $ cities numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ and $ n-1 $ bidirectional roads numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n-1 $ . One can go from any city to any other city using these roads.\n\nThere are two types of people in ALT:\n\n1. Guardians. A guardian lives in a house alongside a road and guards the road.\n2. Citizens. A citizen lives in a house inside a city and works in an office in another city.\n\nEvery person on ALT is either a guardian or a citizen and there's exactly one guardian alongside each road.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF786E/98823384a51131ca904b345eb24e1dfd63229a39.png)Rick and Morty talked to all the people in ALT, and here's what they got:\n\n- There are $ m $ citizens living in ALT.\n- Citizen number $ i $ lives in city number $ x_{i} $ and works in city number $ y_{i} $ .\n- Every day each citizen will go through all roads along the shortest path from his home to his work.\n- A citizen will be happy if and only if either he himself has a puppy himself or all of guardians along his path to his work has a puppy (he sees the guardian's puppy in each road and will be happy).\n- A guardian is always happy.\n\nYou need to tell Rick and Morty the minimum number of puppies they need in order to make all people in ALT happy, and also provide an optimal way to distribute these puppies.",
