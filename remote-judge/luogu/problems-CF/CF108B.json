    "description": "Tattah's youngest brother, Tuftuf, is new to programming.\n\nSince his older brother is such a good programmer, his biggest dream is to outshine him. Tuftuf is a student at the German University in Cairo (GUC) where he learns to write programs in Gava.\n\nToday, Tuftuf was introduced to Gava's unsigned integer datatypes. Gava has $ n $ unsigned integer datatypes of sizes (in bits) $ a_{1},a_{2},...\\ a_{n} $ . The $ i $ -th datatype have size $ a_{i} $ bits, so it can represent every integer between $ 0 $ and $ 2^{a_{i}}-1 $ inclusive.\n\nTuftuf is thinking of learning a better programming language. If there exists an integer $ x $ , such that $ x $ fits in some type $ i $ (in $ a_{i} $ bits) and $ x\u00b7x $ does not fit in some other type $ j $ (in $ a_{j} $ bits) where $ a_{i}&lt;a_{j} $ , then Tuftuf will stop using Gava.\n\nYour task is to determine Tuftuf's destiny.",
