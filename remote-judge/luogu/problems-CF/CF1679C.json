    "description": "You have a square chessboard of size $ n \\times n $ . Rows are numbered from top to bottom with numbers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , and columns \u2014 from left to right with numbers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . So, each cell is denoted with pair of integers $ (x, y) $ ( $ 1 \\le x, y \\le n $ ), where $ x $ is a row number and $ y $ is a column number.\n\nYou have to perform $ q $ queries of three types:\n\n- Put a new rook in cell $ (x, y) $ .\n- Remove a rook from cell $ (x, y) $ . It's guaranteed that the rook was put in this cell before.\n- Check if each cell of subrectangle $ (x_1, y_1) - (x_2, y_2) $ of the board is attacked by at least one rook.\n\nSubrectangle is a set of cells $ (x, y) $ such that for each cell two conditions are satisfied: $ x_1 \\le x \\le x_2 $ and $ y_1 \\le y \\le y_2 $ .\n\nRecall that cell $ (a, b) $ is attacked by a rook placed in cell $ (c, d) $ if either $ a = c $ or $ b = d $ . In particular, the cell containing a rook is attacked by this rook.",

Description begins with integer $ t $ ( $ t \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $ ) which denotes type of a query:\n\n- If $ t = 1 $ , two integers $ x $ and $ y $ follows ( $ 1 \\le x, y \\le n $ ) \u2014 coordinated of the cell where the new rook should be put in. It's guaranteed that there is no rook in the cell $ (x, y) $ at the moment of the given query.\n- If $ t = 2 $ , two integers $ x $ and $ y $ follows ( $ 1 \\le x, y \\le n $ ) \u2014 coordinates of the cell to remove a rook from. It's guaranteed that there is a rook in the cell $ (x, y) $ at the moment of the given query.\n- If $ t = 3 $ , four integers $ x_1, y_1, x_2 $ and $ y_2 $ follows ( $ 1 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le n $ , $ 1 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 \\le n $ ) \u2014 subrectangle to check if each cell of it is attacked by at least one rook.\n\nIt's guaranteed that among $ q $ queries there is at least one query of the third type.",
