    "description": "Little C loves number \u00ab3\u00bb very much. He loves all things about it.\n\nNow he is playing a game on a chessboard of size $ n \\times m $ . The cell in the $ x $ -th row and in the $ y $ -th column is called $ (x,y) $ . Initially, The chessboard is empty. Each time, he places two chessmen on two different empty cells, the Manhattan distance between which is exactly $ 3 $ . The Manhattan distance between two cells $ (x_i,y_i) $ and $ (x_j,y_j) $ is defined as $ |x_i-x_j|+|y_i-y_j| $ .\n\nHe want to place as many chessmen as possible on the chessboard. Please help him find the maximum number of chessmen he can place.",
    "inputFormat": "A single line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \\leq n,m \\leq 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the number of rows and the number of columns of the chessboard.",
