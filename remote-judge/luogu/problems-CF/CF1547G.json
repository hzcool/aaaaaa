    "description": "You are given a directed graph $ G $ which can contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). Multi-edges are absent in $ G $ which means that for all ordered pairs $ (u, v) $ exists at most one edge from $ u $ to $ v $ . Vertices are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .\n\nA path from $ u $ to $ v $ is a sequence of edges such that:\n\n- vertex $ u $ is the start of the first edge in the path;\n- vertex $ v $ is the end of the last edge in the path;\n- for all pairs of adjacent edges next edge starts at the vertex that the previous edge ends on.\n\nWe will assume that the empty sequence of edges is a path from $ u $ to $ u $ .\n\nFor each vertex $ v $ output one of four values:\n\n- $ 0 $ , if there are no paths from $ 1 $ to $ v $ ;\n- $ 1 $ , if there is only one path from $ 1 $ to $ v $ ;\n- $ 2 $ , if there is more than one path from $ 1 $ to $ v $ and the number of paths is finite;\n- $ -1 $ , if the number of paths from $ 1 $ to $ v $ is infinite.\n\nLet's look at the example shown in the figure.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1547G/a4b02f44561ea758b32895e8c86bf8c61025231c.png)Then:\n\n- the answer for vertex $ 1 $ is $ 1 $ : there is only one path from $ 1 $ to $ 1 $ (path with length $ 0 $ );\n- the answer for vertex $ 2 $ is $ 0 $ : there are no paths from $ 1 $ to $ 2 $ ;\n- the answer for vertex $ 3 $ is $ 1 $ : there is only one path from $ 1 $ to $ 3 $ (it is the edge $ (1, 3) $ );\n- the answer for vertex $ 4 $ is $ 2 $ : there are more than one paths from $ 1 $ to $ 4 $ and the number of paths are finite (two paths: $ [(1, 3), (3, 4)] $ and $ [(1, 4)] $ );\n- the answer for vertex $ 5 $ is $ -1 $ : the number of paths from $ 1 $ to $ 5 $ is infinite (the loop can be used in a path many times);\n- the answer for vertex $ 6 $ is $ -1 $ : the number of paths from $ 1 $ to $ 6 $ is infinite (the loop can be used in a path many times).",
