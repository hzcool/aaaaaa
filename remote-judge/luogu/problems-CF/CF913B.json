    "description": "Consider a rooted tree. A rooted tree has one special vertex called the root. All edges are directed from the root. Vertex $ u $ is called a child of vertex $ v $ and vertex $ v $ is called a parent of vertex $ u $ if there exists a directed edge from $ v $ to $ u $ . A vertex is called a leaf if it doesn't have children and has a parent.\n\nLet's call a rooted tree a spruce if its every non-leaf vertex has at least $ 3 $ leaf children. You are given a rooted tree, check whether it's a spruce.\n\nThe definition of a rooted tree can be found [here](https://goo.gl/1dqvzz).",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ n $ \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree ( $ 3<=n<=1000 $ ). Each of the next $ n-1 $ lines contains one integer $ p_{i} $ ( $ 1<=i<=n-1 $ ) \u2014 the index of the parent of the $ i+1 $ -th vertex ( $ 1<=p_{i}<=i $ ).\n\nVertex $ 1 $ is the root. It's guaranteed that the root has at least $ 2 $ children.",
