    "description": "Consider a deck of cards. Each card has one of $ 4 $ suits, and there are exactly $ n $ cards for each suit \u2014 so, the total number of cards in the deck is $ 4n $ . The deck is shuffled randomly so that each of $ (4n)! $ possible orders of cards in the deck has the same probability of being the result of shuffling. Let $ c_i $ be the $ i $ -th card of the deck (from top to bottom).\n\nMonocarp starts drawing the cards from the deck one by one. Before drawing a card, he tries to guess its suit. Monocarp remembers the suits of the $ k $ last cards, and his guess is the suit that appeared the least often among the last $ k $ cards he has drawn. So, while drawing the $ i $ -th card, Monocarp guesses that its suit is the suit that appears the minimum number of times among the cards $ c_{i-k}, c_{i-k+1}, \\dots, c_{i-1} $ (if $ i \\le k $ , Monocarp considers all previously drawn cards, that is, the cards $ c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_{i-1} $ ). If there are multiple suits that appeared the minimum number of times among the previous cards Monocarp remembers, he chooses a random suit out of those for his guess (all suits that appeared the minimum number of times have the same probability of being chosen).\n\nAfter making a guess, Monocarp draws a card and compares its suit to his guess. If they match, then his guess was correct; otherwise it was incorrect.\n\nYour task is to calculate the expected number of correct guesses Monocarp makes after drawing all $ 4n $ cards from the deck.",
