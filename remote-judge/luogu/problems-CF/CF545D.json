    "description": "Little girl Susie went shopping with her mom and she wondered how to improve service quality.\n\nThere are $ n $ people in the queue. For each person we know time $ t_{i} $ needed to serve him. A person will be disappointed if the time he waits is more than the time needed to serve him. The time a person waits is the total time when all the people who stand in the queue in front of him are served. Susie thought that if we swap some people in the queue, then we can decrease the number of people who are disappointed.\n\nHelp Susie find out what is the maximum number of not disappointed people can be achieved by swapping people in the queue.",
