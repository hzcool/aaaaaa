All other cells are colored in black.\n\nYou have $ w $ white dominoes ( $ 2 \\times 1 $ tiles, both cells are colored in white) and $ b $ black dominoes ( $ 2 \\times 1 $ tiles, both cells are colored in black).\n\nYou can place a white domino on the board if both board's cells are white and not occupied by any other domino. In the same way, you can place a black domino if both cells are black and not occupied by any other domino.\n\nCan you place all $ w + b $ dominoes on the board if you can place dominoes both horizontally and vertically?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 3000 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $ n $ , $ k_1 $ and $ k_2 $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 1000 $ ; $ 0 \\le k_1, k_2 \\le n $ ).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains two integers $ w $ and $ b $ ( $ 0 \\le w, b \\le n $ ).",

    "hint": "In the first test case, $ n = 1 $ , $ k_1 = 0 $ and $ k_2 = 1 $ . It means that $ 2 \\times 1 $ board has black cell $ (1, 1) $ and white cell $ (2, 1) $ . So, you can't place any white domino, since there is only one white cell.\n\nIn the second test case, the board of the same size $ 2 \\times 1 $ , but both cell are white. Since $ w = 0 $ and $ b = 0 $ , so you can place $ 0 + 0 = 0 $ dominoes on the board.\n\nIn the third test case, board $ 2 \\times 3 $ , but fully colored in black (since $ k_1 = k_2 = 0 $ ), so you can't place any white domino.\n\nIn the fourth test case, cells $ (1, 1) $ , $ (1, 2) $ , $ (1, 3) $ , and $ (2, 1) $ are white and other cells are black. You can place $ 2 $ white dominoes at positions $ ((1, 1), (2, 1)) $ and $ ((1, 2), (1, 3)) $ and $ 2 $ black dominoes at positions $ ((1, 4), (2, 4)) $ $ ((2, 2), (2, 3)) $ .",
