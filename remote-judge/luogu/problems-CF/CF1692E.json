In one operation, he removes either the first or the last element of the array.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of operations Slavic has to perform such that the total sum of the array is equal to $ s $ after performing all the operations?

The array turns into $ [1, 0] $ , which has a sum equal to $ 1 $ .\n\nIn the third test case, the sum of the array is $ 5 $ and we need it to be $ 3 $ .
