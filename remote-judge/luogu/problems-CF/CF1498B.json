Each rectangle's width is a power of $ 2 $ (i. e. it can be represented as $ 2^x $ for some non-negative integer $ x $ ).\n\nYou are also given a two-dimensional box of width $ W $ . Note that $ W $ may or may not be a power of $ 2 $ . Moreover, $ W $ is at least as large as the width of the largest rectangle.\n\nYou have to find the smallest height of this box, such that it is able to fit all the given rectangles. It is allowed to have some empty space left in this box after fitting all the rectangles.\n\nYou cannot rotate the given rectangles to make them fit into the box. Moreover, any two distinct rectangles must not overlap, i. e., any two distinct rectangles must have zero intersection area.\n\nSee notes for visual explanation of sample input.",
