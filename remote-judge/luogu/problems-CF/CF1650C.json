The coordinates of all points are different, and the points are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ m $ .\n\nA sequence of $ n $ segments $ [l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \\dots, [l_n, r_n] $ is called system of nested segments if for each pair $ i, j $ ( $ 1 \\le i < j \\le n $ ) the condition $ l_i < l_j < r_j < r_i $ is satisfied. In other words, the second segment is strictly inside the first one, the third segment is strictly inside the second one, and so on.\n\nFor a given number $ n $ , find a system of nested segments such that:\n\n- both ends of each segment are one of $ m $ given points;\n- the sum of the weights $ 2\\cdot n $ of the points used as ends of the segments is minimal.\n\nFor example, let $ m = 8 $ . The given points are marked in the picture, their weights are marked in red, their coordinates are marked in blue. Make a system of three nested segments:\n\n- weight of the first segment: $ 1 + 1 = 2 $\n- weight of the second segment: $ 10 + (-1) = 9 $\n- weight of the third segment: $ 3 + (-2) = 1 $\n- sum of the weights of all the segments in the system: $ 2 + 9 + 1 = 12 $\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1650C/5aeab71f3d5a716d6e18fda5439622dc4cd35cbc.png)System of three nested segments",
