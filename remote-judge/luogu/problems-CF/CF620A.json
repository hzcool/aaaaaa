    "description": "Professor GukiZ makes a new robot. The robot are in the point with coordinates $ (x_{1},y_{1}) $ and should go to the point $ (x_{2},y_{2}) $ . In a single step the robot can change any of its coordinates (maybe both of them) by one (decrease or increase). So the robot can move in one of the $ 8 $ directions. Find the minimal number of steps the robot should make to get the finish position.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ x_{1},y_{1} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=x_{1},y_{1}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the start position of the robot.\n\nThe second line contains two integers $ x_{2},y_{2} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=x_{2},y_{2}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the finish position of the robot.",

    "hint": "In the first example robot should increase both of its coordinates by one four times, so it will be in position $ (4,4) $ . After that robot should simply increase its $ y $ coordinate and get the finish position.\n\nIn the second example robot should simultaneously increase $ x $ coordinate and decrease $ y $ coordinate by one three times.",
