    "description": "You are given two permutations $ p $ and $ q $ , consisting of $ n $ elements, and $ m $ queries of the form: $ l_{1},r_{1},l_{2},r_{2} $ $ (l_{1}<=r_{1};\u00a0l_{2}<=r_{2}) $ . The response for the query is the number of such integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , that their position in the first permutation is in segment $ [l_{1},r_{1}] $ (borders included), and position in the second permutation is in segment $ [l_{2},r_{2}] $ (borders included too).\n\nA permutation of $ n $ elements is the sequence of $ n $ distinct integers, each not less than $ 1 $ and not greater than $ n $ .\n\nPosition of number $ v $ $ (1<=v<=n) $ in permutation $ g_{1},g_{2},...,g_{n} $ is such number $ i $ , that $ g_{i}=v $ .",

The following line contains $ n $ integers, separated with spaces: $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n}\\ (1<=p_{i}<=n) $ . These are elements of the first permutation. The next line contains the second permutation $ q_{1},q_{2},...,q_{n} $ in same format.\n\nThe following line contains an integer $ m\\ (1<=m<=2\u00b710^{5}) $ , that is the number of queries.\n\nThe following $ m $ lines contain descriptions of queries one in a line. The description of the $ i $ -th query consists of four integers: $ a,b,c,d\\ (1<=a,b,c,d<=n) $ . Query parameters $ l_{1},r_{1},l_{2},r_{2} $ are obtained from the numbers $ a,b,c,d $ using the following algorithm:\n\n1. Introduce variable $ x $ . If it is the first query, then the variable equals $ 0 $ , else it equals the response for the previous query plus one.\n2. Introduce function $ f(z)=((z-1+x)\\ mod\\ n)+1 $ .\n3. Suppose $ l_{1}=min(f(a),f(b)),r_{1}=max(f(a),f(b)),l_{2}=min(f(c),f(d)),r_{2}=max(f(c),f(d)) $ .",
