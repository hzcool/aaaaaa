A tree is an undirected connected acyclic graph.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1244D/0b019d9da08990633b2a6779b2699db8afb883d7.png)Example of a tree.You have to paint each vertex into one of three colors. For each vertex, you know the cost of painting it in every color.\n\nYou have to paint the vertices so that any path consisting of exactly three distinct vertices does not contain any vertices with equal colors. In other words, let's consider all triples $ (x, y, z) $ such that $ x \\neq y, y \\neq z, x \\neq z $ , $ x $ is connected by an edge with $ y $ , and $ y $ is connected by an edge with $ z $ . The colours of $ x $ , $ y $ and $ z $ should be pairwise distinct. Let's call a painting which meets this condition good.\n\nYou have to calculate the minimum cost of a good painting and find one of the optimal paintings. If there is no good painting, report about it.",

    "hint": "All vertices should be painted in different colors in the first example. The optimal way to do it is to paint the first vertex into color $ 1 $ , the second vertex \u2014 into color $ 3 $ , and the third vertex \u2014 into color $ 2 $ .
