The segment contains all the points in the range $ [l_i, r_i] $ , inclusive, and its color denoted by $ c_i $ :\n\n- if $ c_i = 0 $ , it is a red segment;\n- if $ c_i = 1 $ , it is a blue segment.\n\nWe say that two segments of different colors are connected, if they share at least one common point. Two segments belong to the same group, if they are either connected directly, or through a sequence of directly connected segments. Find the number of groups of segments.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1691E/82e599b6f05721e46a21456ef572639590d4dbf3.png)",
