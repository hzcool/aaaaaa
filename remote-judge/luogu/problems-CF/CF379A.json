    "description": "Vasily the Programmer loves romance, so this year he decided to illuminate his room with candles.\n\nVasily has $ a $ candles.When Vasily lights up a new candle, it first burns for an hour and then it goes out. Vasily is smart, so he can make $ b $ went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.\n\nNow Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.",
