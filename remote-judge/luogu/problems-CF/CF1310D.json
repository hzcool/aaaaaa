    "description": "Masha lives in a country with $ n $ cities numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . She lives in the city number $ 1 $ .\n\nThere is a direct train route between each pair of distinct cities $ i $ and $ j $ , where $ i \\neq j $ . In total there are $ n(n-1) $ distinct routes. Every route has a cost, cost for route from $ i $ to $ j $ may be different from the cost of route from $ j $ to $ i $ .\n\nMasha wants to start her journey in city $ 1 $ , take exactly $ k $ routes from one city to another and as a result return to the city $ 1 $ . Masha is really careful with money, so she wants the journey to be as cheap as possible. To do so Masha doesn't mind visiting a city multiple times or even taking the same route multiple times.\n\nMasha doesn't want her journey to have odd cycles. Formally, if you can select visited by Masha city $ v $ , take odd number of routes used by Masha in her journey and return to the city $ v $ , such journey is considered unsuccessful.\n\nHelp Masha to find the cheapest (with minimal total cost of all taken routes) successful journey.",
    "inputFormat": "First line of input had two integer numbers $ n,k $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 80; 2 \\leq k \\leq 10 $ ): number of cities in the country and number of routes in Masha's journey. It is guaranteed that $ k $ is even.\n\nNext $ n $ lines hold route descriptions: $ j $ -th number in $ i $ -th line represents the cost of route from $ i $ to $ j $ if $ i \\neq j $ , and is 0 otherwise (there are no routes $ i \\to i $ ). All route costs are integers from $ 0 $ to $ 10^8 $ .",
