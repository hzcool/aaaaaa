    "description": "Mike wants to prepare for IMO but he doesn't know geometry, so his teacher gave him an interesting geometry problem. Let's define $ f([l,r])=r-l+1 $ to be the number of integer points in the segment $ [l,r] $ with $ l<=r $ (say that ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF689E/eeb8344fc6181df63840b4617c77d0b7d8f368f7.png)). You are given two integers $ n $ and $ k $ and $ n $ closed intervals $ [l_{i},r_{i}] $ on $ OX $ axis and you have to find:\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF689E/babb2cf528ef0c11f1d2962e2d5be706b0377f3a.png)In other words, you should find the sum of the number of integer points in the intersection of any $ k $ of the segments.\n\nAs the answer may be very large, output it modulo $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ).\n\nMike can't solve this problem so he needs your help. You will help him, won't you?",
