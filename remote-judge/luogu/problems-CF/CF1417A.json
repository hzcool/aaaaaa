He has got $ n $ piles of candies, the $ i $ -th pile initially contains $ a_i $ candies. BThero can cast a copy-paste spell as follows:\n\n1. He chooses two piles $ (i, j) $ such that $ 1 \\le i, j \\le n $ and $ i \\ne j $ .\n2. All candies from pile $ i $ are copied into pile $ j $ . Formally, the operation $ a_j := a_j + a_i $ is performed.\n\nBThero can cast this spell any number of times he wants to \u2014 but unfortunately, if some pile contains strictly more than $ k $ candies, he loses his magic power. What is the maximum number of times BThero can cast the spell without losing his power?",
