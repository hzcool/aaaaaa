    "description": "Annie has gotten bored of winning every coding contest and farming unlimited rating. Today, she is going to farm potatoes instead.\n\nAnnie's garden is an infinite 2D plane. She has $ n $ potatoes to plant, and the $ i $ -th potato must be planted at $ (x_i,y_i) $ . Starting at the point $ (0, 0) $ , Annie begins walking, in one step she can travel one unit right or up (increasing her $ x $ or $ y $ coordinate by $ 1 $ respectively). At any point $ (X,Y) $ during her walk she can plant some potatoes at arbitrary points using her potato gun, consuming $ \\max(|X-x|,|Y-y|) $ units of energy in order to plant a potato at $ (x,y) $ . Find the minimum total energy required to plant every potato.\n\nNote that Annie may plant any number of potatoes from any point.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains the integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 800\\,000 $ ).\n\nThe next $ n $ lines contain two integers $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ ( $ 0 \\le x_i,y_i \\le 10^9 $ ), representing the location of the $ i $ -th potato. It is possible that some potatoes should be planted in the same location.",
