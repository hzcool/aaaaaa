He has to find the number of ways to split the polygon into non-degenerate triangles, each way must satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- each vertex of each triangle is one of the polygon vertex;\n- each side of the polygon must be the side of exactly one triangle;\n- the area of intersection of every two triangles equals to zero, and the sum of all areas of triangles equals to the area of the polygon;\n- each triangle must be completely inside the polygon;\n- each side of each triangle must contain exactly two vertices of the polygon.\n\nThe picture below depicts an example of a correct splitting.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF437E/a8e2701cc66365983a77c546adbf6d2315ebb4eb.png)Please, help the child.
