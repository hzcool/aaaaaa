    "description": "Vasya the carpenter has an estate that is separated from the wood by a fence. The fence consists of $ n $ planks put in a line. The fence is not closed in a circle. The planks are numbered from left to right from 1 to $ n $ , the $ i $ -th plank is of height $ a_{i} $ . All planks have the same width, the lower edge of each plank is located at the ground level.\n\nRecently a local newspaper \"Malevich and Life\" wrote that the most fashionable way to decorate a fence in the summer is to draw a fuchsia-colored rectangle on it, the lower side of the rectangle must be located at the lower edge of the fence.\n\nVasya is delighted with this idea! He immediately bought some fuchsia-colored paint and began to decide what kind of the rectangle he should paint. Vasya is sure that the rectangle should cover $ k $ consecutive planks. In other words, he will paint planks number $ x $ , $ x+1 $ , $ ... $ , $ x+k-1 $ for some $ x $ $ (1<=x<=n-k+1) $ . He wants to paint the rectangle of maximal area, so the rectangle height equals $ min\\ a_{i} $ for $ x<=i<=x+k-1 $ , $ x $ is the number of the first colored plank.\n\nVasya has already made up his mind that the rectangle width can be equal to one of numbers of the sequence $ k_{1},k_{2},...,k_{m} $ . For each $ k_{i} $ he wants to know the expected height of the painted rectangle, provided that he selects $ x $ for such fence uniformly among all $ n-k_{i}+1 $ possible values. Help him to find the expected heights.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{6}) $ \u2014 the number of planks in the fence. The second line contains a sequence of integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) where $ a_{i} $ is the height of the $ i $ -th plank of the fence.\n\nThe third line contains an integer $ m $ $ (1<=m<=10^{6}) $ and the next line contains $ m $ space-separated integers $ k_{1},k_{2},...,k_{m} $ $ (1<=k_{i}<=n) $ where $ k_{i} $ is the width of the desired fuchsia-colored rectangle in planks.",
    "outputFormat": "Print $ m $ whitespace-separated real numbers, the $ i $ -th number equals the expected value of the rectangle height, if its width in planks equals $ k_{i} $ . The value will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $ 10^{-9} $ .",

For the first position $ (x=1) $ the height is 3, for the second one $ (x=2) $ the height is 2, for the third one $ (x=3) $ the height is 1.
