    "description": "Hossam makes a big party, and he will invite his friends to the party.\n\nHe has $ n $ friends numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . They will be arranged in a queue as follows: $ 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n $ .\n\nHossam has a list of $ m $ pairs of his friends that don't know each other. Any pair not present in this list are friends.\n\nA subsegment of the queue starting from the friend $ a $ and ending at the friend $ b $ is $ [a, a + 1, a + 2, \\ldots, b] $ . A subsegment of the queue is called good when all pairs of that segment are friends.\n\nHossam wants to know how many pairs $ (a, b) $ there are ( $ 1 \\le a \\le b \\le n $ ), such that the subsegment starting from the friend $ a $ and ending at the friend $ b $ is good.",
    "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4 $ ), the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integer numbers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 10^5 $ , $ 0 \\le m \\le 10^5 $ ) representing the number of friends and the number of pairs, respectively.\n\nThe $ i $ -th of the next $ m $ lines contains two integers $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ ( $ 1 \\le x_i, y_i\\le n $ , $ x_i \\neq y_i $ ) representing a pair of Hossam's friends that don't know each other.\n\nNote that pairs can be repeated.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 10^5 $ , and the sum of $ m $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
