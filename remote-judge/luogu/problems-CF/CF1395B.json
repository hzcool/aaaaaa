    "description": "Boboniu likes playing chess with his employees. As we know, no employee can beat the boss in the chess game, so Boboniu has never lost in any round.\n\nYou are a new applicant for his company. Boboniu will test you with the following chess question:\n\nConsider a $ n\\times m $ grid (rows are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , and columns are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ m $ ). You have a chess piece, and it stands at some cell $ (S_x,S_y) $ which is not on the border (i.e. $ 2 \\le S_x \\le n-1 $ and $ 2       \\le S_y \\le m-1 $ ).\n\nFrom the cell $ (x,y) $ , you can move your chess piece to $ (x,y') $ ( $ 1\\le y'\\le m, y' \\neq y $ ) or $ (x',y) $ ( $ 1\\le x'\\le n, x'\\neq x $ ). In other words, the chess piece moves as a rook. From the cell, you can move to any cell on the same row or column.\n\nYour goal is to visit each cell exactly once. Can you find a solution?\n\nNote that cells on the path between two adjacent cells in your route are not counted as visited, and it is not required to return to the starting point.",
    "inputFormat": "The only line of the input contains four integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ S_x $ and $ S_y $ ( $ 3\\le n,m\\le 100 $ , $ 2 \\le       S_x \\le n-1 $ , $ 2 \\le S_y \\le m-1 $ ) \u2014 the number of rows, the number of columns, and the initial position of your chess piece, respectively.",
    "outputFormat": "You should print $ n\\cdot m $ lines.\n\nThe $ i $ -th line should contain two integers $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ ( $ 1 \\leq x_i \\leq n $ , $ 1 \\leq y_i \\leq m $ ), denoting the $ i $ -th cell that you visited. You should print exactly $ nm $ pairs $ (x_i, y_i) $ , they should cover all possible pairs $ (x_i, y_i) $ , such that $ 1 \\leq x_i \\leq       n $ , $ 1 \\leq y_i \\leq m $ .\n\nWe can show that under these constraints there always exists a solution. If there are multiple answers, print any.",
