    "description": "Little Dima has two sequences of points with integer coordinates: sequence $ (a_{1},1),(a_{2},2),...,(a_{n},n) $ and sequence $ (b_{1},1),(b_{2},2),...,(b_{n},n) $ .\n\nNow Dima wants to count the number of distinct sequences of points of length $ 2\u00b7n $ that can be assembled from these sequences, such that the $ x $ -coordinates of points in the assembled sequence will not decrease. Help him with that. Note that each element of the initial sequences should be used exactly once in the assembled sequence.\n\nDima considers two assembled sequences $ (p_{1},q_{1}),(p_{2},q_{2}),...,(p_{2\u00b7n},q_{2\u00b7n}) $ and $ (x_{1},y_{1}),(x_{2},y_{2}),...,(x_{2\u00b7n},y_{2\u00b7n}) $ distinct, if there is such $ i $ $ (1<=i<=2\u00b7n) $ , that $ (p_{i},q_{i})\u2260(x_{i},y_{i}) $ .\n\nAs the answer can be rather large, print the remainder from dividing the answer by number $ m $ .",
