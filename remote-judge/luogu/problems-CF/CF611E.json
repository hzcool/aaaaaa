    "description": "Do you know the story about the three musketeers? Anyway, you must help them now.\n\nRichelimakieu is a cardinal in the city of Bearis. He found three brave warriors and called them the three musketeers. Athos has strength $ a $ , Borthos strength $ b $ , and Caramis has strength $ c $ .\n\nThe year 2015 is almost over and there are still $ n $ criminals to be defeated. The $ i $ -th criminal has strength $ t_{i} $ . It's hard to defeat strong criminals \u2014 maybe musketeers will have to fight together to achieve it.\n\nRichelimakieu will coordinate musketeers' actions. In each hour each musketeer can either do nothing or be assigned to one criminal. Two or three musketeers can be assigned to the same criminal and then their strengths are summed up. A criminal can be defeated in exactly one hour (also if two or three musketeers fight him). Richelimakieu can't allow the situation where a criminal has strength bigger than the sum of strengths of musketeers fighting him \u2014 a criminal would win then!\n\nIn other words, there are three ways to defeat a criminal.\n\n- A musketeer of the strength $ x $ in one hour can defeat a criminal of the strength not greater than $ x $ . So, for example Athos in one hour can defeat criminal $ i $ only if $ t_{i}<=a $ .\n- Two musketeers can fight together and in one hour defeat a criminal of the strength not greater than the sum of strengths of these two musketeers. So, for example Athos and Caramis in one hour can defeat criminal $ i $ only if $ t_{i}<=a+c $ . Note that the third remaining musketeer can either do nothing or fight some other criminal.\n- Similarly, all three musketeers can fight together and in one hour defeat a criminal of the strength not greater than the sum of musketeers' strengths, i.e. $ t_{i}<=a+b+c $ .\n\nRichelimakieu doesn't want musketeers to fight during the New Year's Eve. Thus, he must coordinate their actions in order to minimize the number of hours till all criminals will be defeated.\n\nFind the minimum number of hours to defeat all criminals. If musketeers can't defeat them all then print \"-1\" (without the quotes) instead.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=200000 $ ) \u2014 the number of criminals.\n\nThe second line contains three integers $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ ( $ 1<=a,b,c<=10^{8} $ ) \u2014 strengths of musketeers.\n\nThe third line contains $ n $ integers $ t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n} $ ( $ 1<=t_{i}<=10^{8} $ ) \u2014 strengths of criminals.",
    "outputFormat": "Print one line with the answer.\n\nIf it's impossible to defeat all criminals, print \"-1\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print the minimum number of hours the three musketeers will spend on defeating all criminals.",

They can defeat all criminals in two hours:\n\n- Borthos and Caramis should together fight a criminal with strength $ 50 $ . In the same hour Athos can fight one of four criminals with strength $ 1 $ .\n- There are three criminals left, each with strength $ 1 $ . Each musketeer can fight one criminal in the second hour.\n\nIn the second sample all three musketeers must together fight a criminal with strength $ 51 $ . It takes one hour. In the second hour they can fight separately, each with one criminal. In the third hour one criminal is left and any of musketeers can fight him.",
