    "description": "Polycarp is the project manager in the IT-company. Right now, he needs to choose developers for his team to start a new project. The company has $ n $ developers \"on the bench\" (i.e not involved in other projects). Polycarp assessed the skills of each of them: $ a_i $ ( $ -10^4 \\le a_i \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 an integer characteristic of the $ i $ -th developer. This value can be either positive, zero or even negative (some developers cause distractions).\n\nAfter Polycarp chooses a subset of developers for his team, the strength of the team will be determined by the sum of $ a_i $ values for all selected developers.\n\nPolycarp fears that if he chooses a team in such a way that maximizes the sum of the characteristics of $ a_i $ , other managers may find this unacceptable. For this reason, he plans to create such a team that the sum of the $ a_i $ values for it is strictly less than the maximum possible value.\n\nHelp Polycarp choose any team that:\n\n- the sum of the characteristics $ a_i $ for all members of the selected team is strictly less than the maximum value that can be achieved by choosing the team in some other way\n- and at the same time, the sum of the characteristics of $ a_i $ for all members of the selected team is the greatest possible.\n\nIf, following the requirements above, you can select a team in several ways, then just find any of them.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of the characteristics in the desired subset is strictly positive (i.e. Polycarp can always choose a non-empty team).",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case begins with a line containing one integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of developers \"on the bench\".\n\nThe second line of a test case contains a sequence of integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ ( $ -10^4 \\le a_i \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the characteristics of the $ n $ developers. It is guaranteed that the characteristics are such that the sum of the characteristics in the answer is strictly positive.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Print the answers for the given $ t $ test cases in the order that they appear in the input. In the first line of each answer, print a positive integer $ s $ \u2014 the sum of the characteristics in the desired subset. The second line should contain only the characters 0 and 1 and match the answer:\n\n- the character in the $ i $ -th position should be equal to 1 if the $ i $ -th developer belongs to the team;\n- the character in the $ i $ -th position should be equal to 0 if the $ i $ -th developer does not belong to the team.\n\nIf there are several answers, print any of them.",

    "hint": "In the first test case, the maximum subset $ a_1, a_3, a_5 $ has a sum equal to $ 3 $ , so Polycarp should choose a team with the maximum total sum which is less than $ 3 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, the maximum subset $ a_1, a_2 $ has a sum equal to $ 12 $ , so Polycarp should choose a team with the maximum total sum which is less than $ 12 $ .\n\nIn the third test case, the maximum subset $ a_1, a_3 $ has a sum equal to $ 9 $ .\n\nIn the fourth test case, the maximum subset $ a_1, a_2 $ has a sum equal to $ 8 $ .\n\nIn the fifth test case, there are several subsets with a maximum sum equal to $ 3 $ , so Polycarp should choose a team with a lower total sum."
