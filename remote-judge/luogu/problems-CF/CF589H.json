    "description": "It is not that easy to create a tourist guide as one might expect. A good tourist guide should properly distribute flow of tourists across the country and maximize the revenue stream from the tourism. This is why there is a number of conditions to be met before a guide may be declared as an official tourist guide and approved by Ministry of Tourism.\n\nMinistry of Tourism has created a list of $ k $ remarkable cities out of $ n $ cities in the country. Basically, it means that in order to conform to strict regulations and to be approved by the ministry a tourist guide should be represented as a set of routes between remarkable cities so that the following conditions are met:\n\n- the first and the last city of every route are distinct remarkable cities,\n- each remarkable city can be an endpoint of at most one route,\n- there is no pair of routes which share a road.\n\nPlease note that a route may pass through a remarkable city. Revenue stream from the tourism highly depends on a number of routes included in a tourist guide so the task is to find out a set of routes conforming the rules of a tourist guide with a maximum number of routes included.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integer numbers $ n,m,k $ $ (1<=n<=50000,0<=m<=50000,1<=k<=n) $ \u2014 the number of cities in the country, the number of roads in the country and the number of remarkable cities correspondingly.\n\nEach of the following $ m $ lines contains two integer numbers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ $ (1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n) $ \u2014 meaning that cities $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ are connected by a bidirectional road. It is guaranteed that $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ are distinct numbers and there is no more than one road between a pair of cities.\n\nThe last line contains $ k $ distinct integer numbers \u2014 a list of remarkable cities. All cities are numbered from 1 to $ n $ .",
    "outputFormat": "The first line of the output should contain $ c $ \u2014 the number of routes in a tourist guide. The following $ c $ lines should contain one tourist route each. Every route should be printed in a form of \" $ t $ $ v_{1} $ $ v_{2} $ ... $ v_{t+1} $ \", where $ t $ is a number of roads in a route and $ v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{t+1} $ \u2014 cities listed in the order they are visited on the route.\n\nIf there are multiple answers print any of them.",
