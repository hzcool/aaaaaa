    "description": "It's the year 5555. You have a graph, and you want to find a long cycle and a huge independent set, just because you can. But for now, let's just stick with finding either.\n\nGiven a connected graph with $ n $ vertices, you can choose to either:\n\n- find an independent set that has exactly $ \\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil $ vertices.\n- find a simple cycle of length at least $ \\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil $ .\n\nAn independent set is a set of vertices such that no two of them are connected by an edge. A simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice. I have a proof you can always solve one of these problems, but it's too long to fit this margin.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 5 \\le n \\le 10^5 $ , $ n-1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices and edges in the graph.\n\nEach of the next $ m $ lines contains two space-separated integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1 \\le u,v \\le n $ ) that mean there's an edge between vertices $ u $ and $ v $ . It's guaranteed that the graph is connected and doesn't contain any self-loops or multiple edges.",
    "outputFormat": "If you choose to solve the first problem, then on the first line print \"1\", followed by a line containing $ \\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil $ distinct integers not exceeding $ n $ , the vertices in the desired independent set.\n\nIf you, however, choose to solve the second problem, then on the first line print \"2\", followed by a line containing one integer, $ c $ , representing the length of the found cycle, followed by a line containing $ c $ distinct integers integers not exceeding $ n $ , the vertices in the desired cycle, in the order they appear in the cycle.",
