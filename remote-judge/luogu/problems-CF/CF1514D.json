    "description": "Baby Ehab has a piece of Cut and Stick with an array $ a $ of length $ n $ written on it. He plans to grab a pair of scissors and do the following to it:\n\n- pick a range $ (l, r) $ and cut out every element $ a_l $ , $ a_{l + 1} $ , ..., $ a_r $ in this range;\n- stick some of the elements together in the same order they were in the array;\n- end up with multiple pieces, where every piece contains some of the elements and every element belongs to some piece.\n\nMore formally, he partitions the sequence $ a_l $ , $ a_{l + 1} $ , ..., $ a_r $ into subsequences. He thinks a partitioning is beautiful if for every piece (subsequence) it holds that, if it has length $ x $ , then no value occurs strictly more than $ \\lceil \\frac{x}{2} \\rceil $ times in it.\n\nHe didn't pick a range yet, so he's wondering: for $ q $ ranges $ (l, r) $ , what is the minimum number of pieces he needs to partition the elements $ a_l $ , $ a_{l + 1} $ , ..., $ a_r $ into so that the partitioning is beautiful.\n\nA sequence $ b $ is a subsequence of an array $ a $ if $ b $ can be obtained from $ a $ by deleting some (possibly zero) elements. Note that it does not have to be contiguous.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 1 \\le n,q \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the length of the array $ a $ and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1 $ , $ a_2 $ , ..., $ a_{n} $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le n $ ) \u2014 the elements of the array $ a $ .\n\nEach of the next $ q $ lines contains two integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n $ ) \u2014 the range of this query.",
    "outputFormat": "For each query, print the minimum number of subsequences you need to partition this range into so that the partitioning is beautiful. We can prove such partitioning always exists.",

    ],
    "hint": "In the first query, you can just put the whole array in one subsequence, since its length is $ 6 $ , and no value occurs more than $ 3 $ times in it.\n\nIn the second query, the elements of the query range are $ [3,2,3,3] $ . You can't put them all in one subsequence, since its length is $ 4 $ , and $ 3 $ occurs more than $ 2 $ times. However, you can partition it into two subsequences: $ [3] $ and $ [2,3,3] $ .",
