    "description": "You are given a permutation $ p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n $ . A permutation of length $ n $ is a sequence such that each integer between $ 1 $ and $ n $ occurs exactly once in the sequence.\n\nFind the number of pairs of indices $ (l, r) $ ( $ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n $ ) such that the value of the median of $ p_l, p_{l+1}, \\dots, p_r $ is exactly the given number $ m $ .\n\nThe median of a sequence is the value of the element which is in the middle of the sequence after sorting it in non-decreasing order. If the length of the sequence is even, the left of two middle elements is used.\n\nFor example, if $ a=[4, 2, 7, 5] $ then its median is $ 4 $ since after sorting the sequence, it will look like $ [2, 4, 5, 7] $ and the left of two middle elements is equal to $ 4 $ . The median of $ [7, 1, 2, 9, 6] $ equals $ 6 $ since after sorting, the value $ 6 $ will be in the middle of the sequence.\n\nWrite a program to find the number of pairs of indices $ (l, r) $ ( $ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n $ ) such that the value of the median of $ p_l, p_{l+1}, \\dots, p_r $ is exactly the given number $ m $ .",
