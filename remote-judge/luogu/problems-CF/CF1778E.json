    "description": "Recently, a tree has fallen on Bob's head from the sky. The tree has $ n $ nodes. Each node $ u $ of the tree has an integer number $ a_u $ written on it. But the tree has no fixed root, as it has fallen from the sky.\n\nBob is currently studying the tree. To add some twist, Alice proposes a game. First, Bob chooses some node $ r $ to be the root of the tree. After that, Alice chooses a node $ v $ and tells him. Bob then can pick one or more nodes from the subtree of $ v $ . His score will be the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of all the values written on the nodes picked by him. Bob has to find the maximum score he can achieve for the given $ r $ and $ v $ .\n\nAs Bob is not a good problem-solver, he asks you to help him find the answer. Can you help him? You need to find the answers for several combinations of $ r $ and $ v $ for the same tree.\n\nRecall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. The subtree of a node $ u $ is the set of all nodes $ y $ such that the simple path from $ y $ to the root passes through $ u $ . Note that $ u $ is in the subtree of $ u $ .",
