    "description": "Vanya got bored and he painted $ n $ distinct points on the plane. After that he connected all the points pairwise and saw that as a result many triangles were formed with vertices in the painted points. He asks you to count the number of the formed triangles with the non-zero area.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2000 $ ) \u2014 the number of the points painted on the plane.\n\nNext $ n $ lines contain two integers each $ x_{i},y_{i} $ ( $ -100<=x_{i},y_{i}<=100 $ ) \u2014 the coordinates of the $ i $ -th point. It is guaranteed that no two given points coincide.",
