    "description": "Professor GukiZ has two arrays of integers, a and b. Professor wants to make the sum of the elements in the array a $ s_{a} $ as close as possible to the sum of the elements in the array b $ s_{b} $ . So he wants to minimize the value $ v=|s_{a}-s_{b}| $ .\n\nIn one operation professor can swap some element from the array a and some element from the array b. For example if the array a is $ [5,1,3,2,4] $ and the array b is $ [3,3,2] $ professor can swap the element $ 5 $ from the array a and the element $ 2 $ from the array b and get the new array a $ [2,1,3,2,4] $ and the new array b $ [3,3,5] $ .\n\nProfessor doesn't want to make more than two swaps. Find the minimal value $ v $ and some sequence of no more than two swaps that will lead to the such value $ v $ . Professor makes swaps one by one, each new swap he makes with the new arrays a and b.",

    "outputFormat": "In the first line print the minimal value $ v=|s_{a}-s_{b}| $ that can be got with no more than two swaps.\n\nThe second line should contain the number of swaps $ k $ ( $ 0<=k<=2 $ ).\n\nEach of the next $ k $ lines should contain two integers $ x_{p},y_{p} $ ( $ 1<=x_{p}<=n,1<=y_{p}<=m $ ) \u2014 the index of the element in the array a and the index of the element in the array b in the $ p $ -th swap.\n\nIf there are several optimal solutions print any of them. Print the swaps in order the professor did them.",
