    "description": "Phoenix loves beautiful arrays. An array is beautiful if all its subarrays of length $ k $ have the same sum. A subarray of an array is any sequence of consecutive elements.\n\nPhoenix currently has an array $ a $ of length $ n $ . He wants to insert some number of integers, possibly zero, into his array such that it becomes beautiful. The inserted integers must be between $ 1 $ and $ n $ inclusive. Integers may be inserted anywhere (even before the first or after the last element), and he is not trying to minimize the number of inserted integers.",
    "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 50 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le k \\le n \\le 100 $ ).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ space-separated integers ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le n $ ) \u2014 the array that Phoenix currently has. This array may or may not be already beautiful.",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, if it is impossible to create a beautiful array, print -1. Otherwise, print two lines.\n\nThe first line should contain the length of the beautiful array $ m $ ( $ n \\le m \\le 10^4 $ ). You don't need to minimize $ m $ .\n\nThe second line should contain $ m $ space-separated integers ( $ 1 \\le b_i \\le n $ ) \u2014 a beautiful array that Phoenix can obtain after inserting some, possibly zero, integers into his array $ a $ . You may print integers that weren't originally in array $ a $ .\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any. It's guaranteed that if we can make array $ a $ beautiful, we can always make it with resulting length no more than $ 10^4 $ .",

    "hint": "In the first test case, we can make array $ a $ beautiful by inserting the integer $ 1 $ at index $ 3 $ (in between the two existing $ 2 $ s). Now, all subarrays of length $ k=2 $ have the same sum $ 3 $ . There exists many other possible solutions, for example:\n\n- $ 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1 $\n- $ 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2 $\n\nIn the second test case, the array is already beautiful: all subarrays of length $ k=3 $ have the same sum $ 5 $ .\n\nIn the third test case, it can be shown that we cannot insert numbers to make array $ a $ beautiful.\n\nIn the fourth test case, the array $ b $ shown is beautiful and all subarrays of length $ k=4 $ have the same sum $ 10 $ . There exist other solutions also.",
