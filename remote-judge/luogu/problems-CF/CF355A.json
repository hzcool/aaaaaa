    "description": "Vasya has recently found out what a digital root of a number is and he decided to share his knowledge with you.\n\nLet's assume that $ S(n) $ is the sum of digits of number $ n $ , for example, $ S(4098)=4+0+9+8=21 $ . Then the digital root of number $ n $ equals to:\n\n1. $ dr(n)=S(n) $ , if $ S(n)&lt;10 $ ;\n2. $ dr(n)=dr(S(n)) $ , if $ S(n)>=10 $ .\n\nFor example, $ dr(4098)=dr(21)=3 $ .\n\nVasya is afraid of large numbers, so the numbers he works with are at most $ 10^{1000} $ . For all such numbers, he has proved that $ dr(n)=S(S(S(S(n)))) $ $ (n<=10^{1000}) $ .\n\nNow Vasya wants to quickly find numbers with the given digital root. The problem is, he hasn't learned how to do that and he asked you to help him. You task is, given numbers $ k $ and $ d $ , find the number consisting of exactly $ k $ digits (the leading zeroes are not allowed), with digital root equal to $ d $ , or else state that such number does not exist.",
