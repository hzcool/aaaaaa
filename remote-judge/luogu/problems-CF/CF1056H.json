    "description": "You successfully found poor Arkady near the exit of the station you've perfectly predicted. You sent him home on a taxi and suddenly came up with a question.\n\nThere are $ n $ crossroads in your city and several bidirectional roads connecting some of them. A taxi ride is a path from some crossroads to another one without passing the same crossroads twice. You have a collection of rides made by one driver and now you wonder if this driver can be a robot or they are definitely a human.\n\nYou think that the driver can be a robot if for every two crossroads $ a $ and $ b $ the driver always chooses the same path whenever he drives from $ a $ to $ b $ . Note that $ a $ and $ b $ here do not have to be the endpoints of a ride and that the path from $ b $ to $ a $ can be different. On the contrary, if the driver ever has driven two different paths from $ a $ to $ b $ , they are definitely a human.\n\nGiven the system of roads and the description of all rides available to you, determine if the driver can be a robot or not.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of crossroads in the city.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \\le q \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of rides available to you.\n\nEach of the following $ q $ lines starts with a single integer $ k $ ( $ 2 \\le k \\le n $ ) \u2014 the number of crossroads visited by the driver on this ride. It is followed by $ k $ integers $ c_1 $ , $ c_2 $ , ..., $ c_k $ ( $ 1 \\le c_i \\le n $ ) \u2014 the crossroads in the order the driver visited them. It is guaranteed that all crossroads in one ride are distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of values $ k $ among all rides of all test cases does not exceed $ 3 \\cdot 10^5 $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of values $ n $ and the sum of values $ q $ doesn't exceed $ 3 \\cdot 10^5 $ among all test cases.",
