    "description": "Kirill lives on a connected undirected graph of $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges at vertex $ 1 $ . One fine evening he gathered $ f $ friends, the $ i $ -th friend lives at the vertex $ h_i $ . So all friends are now in the vertex $ 1 $ , the $ i $ -th friend must get to his home to the vertex $ h_i $ .\n\nThe evening is about to end and it is time to leave. It turned out that $ k $ ( $ k \\le 6 $ ) of his friends have no cars, and they would have to walk if no one gives them a ride. One friend with a car can give a ride to any number of friends without cars, but only if he can give them a ride by driving along one of the shortest paths to his house.\n\nFor example, in the graph below, a friend from vertex $ h_i=5 $ can give a ride to friends from the following sets of vertices: $ [2, 3] $ , $ [2, 4] $ , $ [2] $ , $ [3] $ , $ [4] $ , but can't give a ride to friend from vertex $ 6 $ or a set $ [3, 4] $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1741G/5ddc6bf49e943e05aabc1f2d501a63e46c175460.png)The vertices where friends without cars live are highlighted in green, and with cars \u2014 in red.Kirill wants as few friends as possible to have to walk.
