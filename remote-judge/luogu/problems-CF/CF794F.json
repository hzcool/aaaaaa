    "description": "Bankopolis, the city you already know, finally got a new bank opened! Unfortunately, its security system is not yet working fine... Meanwhile hacker Leha arrived in Bankopolis and decided to test the system!\n\nBank has $ n $ cells for clients' money. A sequence from $ n $ numbers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ describes the amount of money each client has. Leha wants to make requests to the database of the bank, finding out the total amount of money on some subsegments of the sequence and changing values of the sequence on some subsegments. Using a bug in the system, Leha can requests two types of queries to the database:\n\n- 1 l r x y denoting that Leha changes each digit $ x $ to digit $ y $ in each element of sequence $ a_{i} $ , for which $ l<=i<=r $ is holds. For example, if we change in number $ 11984381 $ digit $ 8 $ to $ 4 $ , we get $ 11944341 $ . It's worth noting that Leha, in order to stay in the shadow, never changes digits in the database to $ 0 $ , i.e. $ y\u22600 $ .\n- 2 l r denoting that Leha asks to calculate and print the sum of such elements of sequence $ a_{i} $ , for which $ l<=i<=r $ holds.\n\nAs Leha is a white-hat hacker, he don't want to test this vulnerability on a real database. You are to write a similar database for Leha to test.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ , $ 1<=q<=10^{5} $ ) denoting amount of cells in the bank and total amount of queries respectively.\n\nThe following line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}&lt;10^{9} $ ) denoting the amount of money in each cell initially. These integers do not contain leading zeros.\n\nEach of the following $ q $ lines has one of the formats:\n\n- 1 l r x y ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ , $ 0<=x<=9 $ , $ 1<=y<=9 $ ), denoting Leha asks to change each digit $ x $ on digit $ y $ for each element $ a_{i} $ of the sequence for which $ l<=i<=r $ holds;\n- 2 l r ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ ), denoting you have to calculate and print the sum of elements $ a_{i} $ for which $ l<=i<=r $ holds.",
