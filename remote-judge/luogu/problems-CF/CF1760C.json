    "description": "There are $ n $ participants in a competition, participant $ i $ having a strength of $ s_i $ .\n\nEvery participant wonders how much of an advantage they have over the other best participant. In other words, each participant $ i $ wants to know the difference between $ s_i $ and $ s_j $ , where $ j $ is the strongest participant in the competition, not counting $ i $ (a difference can be negative).\n\nSo, they ask you for your help! For each $ i $ ( $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n $ ) output the difference between $ s_i $ and the maximum strength of any participant other than participant $ i $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot10^5 $ ) \u2014 the length of the array.\n\nThe following line contains $ n $ space-separated positive integers $ s_1 $ , $ s_2 $ , ..., $ s_n $ ( $ 1 \\leq s_i \\leq 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the strengths of the participants.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2\\cdot10^5 $ .",
