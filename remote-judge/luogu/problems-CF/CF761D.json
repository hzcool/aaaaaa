    "description": "Dasha logged into the system and began to solve problems. One of them is as follows:\n\nGiven two sequences $ a $ and $ b $ of length $ n $ each you need to write a sequence $ c $ of length $ n $ , the $ i $ -th element of which is calculated as follows: $ c_{i}=b_{i}-a_{i} $ .\n\nAbout sequences $ a $ and $ b $ we know that their elements are in the range from $ l $ to $ r $ . More formally, elements satisfy the following conditions: $ l<=a_{i}<=r $ and $ l<=b_{i}<=r $ . About sequence $ c $ we know that all its elements are distinct.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF761D/63cff245a6c359006c34b5fd0a255c1b253d148b.png)Dasha wrote a solution to that problem quickly, but checking her work on the standard test was not so easy. Due to an error in the test system only the sequence $ a $ and the compressed sequence of the sequence $ c $ were known from that test.\n\nLet's give the definition to a compressed sequence. A compressed sequence of sequence $ c $ of length $ n $ is a sequence $ p $ of length $ n $ , so that $ p_{i} $ equals to the number of integers which are less than or equal to $ c_{i} $ in the sequence $ c $ . For example, for the sequence $ c=[250,200,300,100,50] $ the compressed sequence will be $ p=[4,3,5,2,1] $ . Pay attention that in $ c $ all integers are distinct. Consequently, the compressed sequence contains all integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ inclusively.\n\nHelp Dasha to find any sequence $ b $ for which the calculated compressed sequence of sequence $ c $ is correct.",
