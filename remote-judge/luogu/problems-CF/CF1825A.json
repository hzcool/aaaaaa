    "description": "LuoTianyi gives you a palindrome $ ^{\\dagger} $ string $ s $ , and she wants you to find out the length of the longest non-empty subsequence $ ^{\\ddagger} $ of $ s $ which is not a palindrome string. If there is no such subsequence, output $ -1 $ instead.\n\n $ ^{\\dagger} $ A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, strings \"z\", \"aaa\", \"aba\", \"abccba\" are palindromes, but strings \"codeforces\", \"reality\", \"ab\" are not.\n\n $ ^{\\ddagger} $ A string $ a $ is a subsequence of a string $ b $ if $ a $ can be obtained from $ b $ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from $ b $ . For example, strings \"a\", \"aaa\", \"bab\" are subsequences of string \"abaab\", but strings \"codeforces\", \"bbb\", \"h\" are not.",

We can prove that \"abcaba\" is an example of the longest subsequences of \"abacaba\" that isn't palindrome, so that the answer is $ 6 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, we can only get \"a\" and \"aa\", but they are all palindrome strings, so the answer is $ -1 $ .",
