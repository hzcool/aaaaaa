    "description": "The first semester ended. You know, after the end of the first semester the holidays begin. On holidays Noora decided to return to Vi\u010dkopolis. As a modest souvenir for Leha, she brought a sausage of length $ m $ from Pavlopolis. Everyone knows that any sausage can be represented as a string of lowercase English letters, the length of which is equal to the length of the sausage.\n\nLeha was very pleased with the gift and immediately ate the sausage. But then he realized that it was a quite tactless act, because the sausage was a souvenir! So the hacker immediately went to the butcher shop. Unfortunately, there was only another sausage of length $ n $ in the shop. However Leha was not upset and bought this sausage. After coming home, he decided to cut the purchased sausage into several pieces and number the pieces starting from $ 1 $ from left to right. Then he wants to select several pieces and glue them together so that the obtained sausage is equal to the sausage that Noora gave. But the hacker can glue two pieces together only when the number of the left piece is less than the number of the right piece. Besides he knows that if he glues more than $ x $ pieces, Noora will notice that he has falsified souvenir sausage and will be very upset. Of course Leha doesn\u2019t want to upset the girl. The hacker asks you to find out whether he is able to cut the sausage he bought, and then glue some of the pieces so that Noora doesn't notice anything.\n\nFormally, you are given two strings $ s $ and $ t $ . The length of the string $ s $ is $ n $ , the length of the string $ t $ is $ m $ . It is required to select several pairwise non-intersecting substrings from $ s $ , so that their concatenation in the same order as these substrings appear in $ s $ , is equal to the string $ t $ . Denote by $ f(s,t) $ the minimal number of substrings to be chosen so that their concatenation is equal to the string $ t $ . If it is impossible to choose such substrings, then $ f(s,t)=\u221e $ . Leha really wants to know whether it\u2019s true that $ f(s,t)<=x $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) \u2014 length of sausage bought by Leha, i.e. the length of the string $ s $ .\n\nThe second line contains string $ s $ of the length $ n $ consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nThe third line contains single integer $ m $ ( $ 1<=m<=n $ ) \u2014 length of sausage bought by Noora, i.e. the length of the string $ t $ .\n\nThe fourth line contains string $ t $ of the length $ m $ consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nThe fifth line contains single integer $ x $ ( $ 1<=x<=30 $ ) \u2014 the maximum number of pieces of sausage that Leha can glue so that Noora doesn\u2019t notice anything.",
    "outputFormat": "In the only line print \"YES\" (without quotes), if Leha is able to succeed in creating new sausage so that Noora doesn't notice anything. Otherwise print \"NO\" (without quotes).",
    "samples": [
        [
            "9\nhloyaygrt\n6\nloyyrt\n3\n",
            "YES\n"
        ],
        [
            "9\nhloyaygrt\n6\nloyyrt\n2\n",
            "NO\n"
        ]
    ],
    "hint": "Let's consider the first sample.\n\nIn the optimal answer, Leha should cut the sausage he bought in the following way: hloyaygrt = h + loy + a + y + g + rt. Then he numbers received parts from $ 1 $ to $ 6 $ :\n\n- h \u2014 number $ 1 $\n- loy \u2014 number $ 2 $\n- a \u2014 number $ 3 $\n- y \u2014 number $ 4 $\n- g \u2014 number $ 5 $\n- rt \u2014 number $ 6 $\n\nHereupon the hacker should glue the parts with numbers $ 2 $ , $ 4 $ and $ 6 $ and get sausage loyygrt equal to one that is given by Noora. Thus, he will have to glue three pieces. Since $ x=3 $ you should print \"YES\" (without quotes).\n\nIn the second sample both sausages coincide with sausages from the first sample. However since $ x=2 $ you should print \"NO\" (without quotes).",
