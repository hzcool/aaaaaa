    "description": "Bill is a famous mathematician in BubbleLand. Thanks to his revolutionary math discoveries he was able to make enough money to build a beautiful house. Unfortunately, for not paying property tax on time, court decided to punish Bill by making him lose a part of his property.\n\nBill\u2019s property can be observed as a convex regular $ 2n $ -sided polygon $ A_{0}\\ A_{1}...\\ A_{2n-1}\\ A_{2n},\\ A_{2n}=\\ A_{0} $ , with sides of the exactly 1 meter in length.\n\nCourt rules for removing part of his property are as follows:\n\n- Split every edge $ A_{k}\\ A_{k+1},\\ k=0...\\ 2n-1 $ in $ n $ equal parts of size $ 1/n $ with points $ P_{0},P_{1},...,P_{n-1} $\n- On every edge $ A_{2k}\\ A_{2k+1},\\ k=0...\\ n-1 $ court will choose one point $ B_{2k}=\\ P_{i} $ for some $ i=0,...,\\ n-1 $ such that ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF852C/e71ce7d28e76a9d68c876b746b3556061957b614.png)\n- On every edge $ A_{2k+1}A_{2k+2},\\ k=0...n-1 $ Bill will choose one point $ B_{2k+1}=\\ P_{i} $ for some $ i=0,...,\\ n-1 $ such that ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF852C/7095d055aa9dac0eea6c740c3e32d5c3310f8624.png)\n- Bill gets to keep property inside of $ 2n $ -sided polygon $ B_{0}\\ B_{1}...\\ B_{2n-1} $\n\nLuckily, Bill found out which $ B_{2k} $ points the court chose. Even though he is a great mathematician, his house is very big and he has a hard time calculating. Therefore, he is asking you to help him choose points so he maximizes area of property he can keep.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer number $ n\\ (2<=n<=50000) $ , representing number of edges of $ 2n $ -sided polygon.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ distinct integer numbers $ B_{2k}\\ (0<=B_{2k}<=n-1,\\ k=0...\\ n-1) $ separated by a single space, representing points the court chose. If $ B_{2k}=i $ , the court chose point $ P_{i} $ on side $ A_{2k}\\ A_{2k+1} $ .",
