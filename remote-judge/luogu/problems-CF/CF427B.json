    "description": "The prison of your city has $ n $ prisoners. As the prison can't accommodate all of them, the city mayor has decided to transfer $ c $ of the prisoners to a prison located in another city.\n\nFor this reason, he made the $ n $ prisoners to stand in a line, with a number written on their chests. The number is the severity of the crime he/she has committed. The greater the number, the more severe his/her crime was.\n\nThen, the mayor told you to choose the $ c $ prisoners, who will be transferred to the other prison. He also imposed two conditions. They are,\n\n- The chosen $ c $ prisoners has to form a contiguous segment of prisoners.\n- Any of the chosen prisoner's crime level should not be greater then $ t $ . Because, that will make the prisoner a severe criminal and the mayor doesn't want to take the risk of his running away during the transfer.\n\nFind the number of ways you can choose the $ c $ prisoners.",

The next line will contain $ n $ space separated integers, the $ i^{th} $ integer is the severity $ i^{th} $ prisoner's crime.
