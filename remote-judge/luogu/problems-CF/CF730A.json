    "description": "A group of $ n $ friends enjoys playing popular video game Toda 2. There is a rating system describing skill level of each player, initially the rating of the $ i $ -th friend is $ r_{i} $ .\n\nThe friends decided to take part in the championship as a team. But they should have equal ratings to be allowed to compose a single team consisting of all $ n $ friends. So the friends are faced with the problem: how to make all their ratings equal.\n\nOne way to change ratings is to willingly lose in some matches. Friends can form a party consisting of two to five (but not more than $ n $ ) friends and play a match in the game. When the party loses, the rating of each of its members decreases by $ 1 $ . A rating can't become negative, so $ r_{i}=0 $ doesn't change after losing.\n\nThe friends can take part in multiple matches, each time making a party from any subset of friends (but remember about constraints on party size: from $ 2 $ to $ 5 $ members).\n\nThe friends want to make their ratings equal but as high as possible.\n\nHelp the friends develop a strategy of losing the matches so that all their ratings become equal and the resulting rating is maximum possible.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=100 $ ) \u2014 the number of friends.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ non-negative integers $ r_{1},r_{2},...,r_{n} $ ( $ 0<=r_{i}<=100 $ ), where $ r_{i} $ is the initial rating of the $ i $ -th friend.",
    "outputFormat": "In the first line, print a single integer $ R $ \u2014 the final rating of each of the friends.\n\nIn the second line, print integer $ t $ \u2014 the number of matches the friends have to play. Each of the following $ t $ lines should contain $ n $ characters '0' or '1', where the $ j $ -th character of the $ i $ -th line is equal to:\n\n- '0', if friend $ j $ should not play in match $ i $ ,\n- '1', if friend $ j $ should play in match $ i $ .\n\nEach line should contain between two and five characters '1', inclusive.\n\nThe value $ t $ should not exceed $ 10^{4} $ , it is guaranteed that such solution exists.\n\nRemember that you shouldn't minimize the value $ t $ , but you should maximize $ R $ . If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
