    "description": "Alice and Bob play the following game. Alice has a set $ S $ of disjoint ranges of integers, initially containing only one range $ [1, n] $ . In one turn, Alice picks a range $ [l, r] $ from the set $ S $ and asks Bob to pick a number in the range. Bob chooses a number $ d $ ( $ l \\le d \\le r $ ). Then Alice removes $ [l, r] $ from $ S $ and puts into the set $ S $ the range $ [l, d - 1] $ (if $ l \\le d - 1 $ ) and the range $ [d + 1, r] $ (if $ d + 1 \\le r $ ). The game ends when the set $ S $ is empty. We can show that the number of turns in each game is exactly $ n $ .\n\nAfter playing the game, Alice remembers all the ranges $ [l, r] $ she picked from the set $ S $ , but Bob does not remember any of the numbers that he picked. But Bob is smart, and he knows he can find out his numbers $ d $ from Alice's ranges, and so he asks you for help with your programming skill.\n\nGiven the list of ranges that Alice has picked ( $ [l, r] $ ), for each range, help Bob find the number $ d $ that Bob has picked.\n\nWe can show that there is always a unique way for Bob to choose his number for a list of valid ranges picked by Alice.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 1000 $ ). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 1000 $ ).\n\nEach of the next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n $ ), denoting the range $ [l, r] $ that Alice picked at some point.\n\nNote that the ranges are given in no particular order.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 1000 $ , and the ranges for each test case are from a valid game.",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case print $ n $ lines. Each line should contain three integers $ l $ , $ r $ , and $ d $ , denoting that for Alice's range $ [l, r] $ Bob picked the number $ d $ .\n\nYou can print the lines in any order. We can show that the answer is unique.\n\nIt is not required to print a new line after each test case. The new lines in the output of the example are for readability only.",
