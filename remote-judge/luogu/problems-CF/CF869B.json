Here $ a! $ denotes the factorial of integer $ a $ , that is, $ a!=1\u00d72\u00d7...\u00d7a $ . Specifically, $ 0!=1 $ .\n\nKoyomi doesn't care much about this, but before he gets into another mess with oddities, he is interested in the number of times the phoenix will reincarnate in a timespan of $ b! $ years, that is, ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF869B/e1b2fb98f4ea484515a807ebc0e143dd3b54b9f1.png). Note that when $ b>=a $ this value is always integer.\n\nAs the answer can be quite large, it would be enough for Koyomi just to know the last digit of the answer in decimal representation. And you're here to provide Koyomi with this knowledge.",
