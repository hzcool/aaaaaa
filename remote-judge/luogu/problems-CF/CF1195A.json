    "description": "Old timers of Summer Informatics School can remember previous camps in which each student was given a drink of his choice on the vechorka (late-evening meal). Or may be the story was more complicated?\n\nThere are $ n $ students living in a building, and for each of them the favorite drink $ a_i $ is known. So you know $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ , where $ a_i $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le k $ ) is the type of the favorite drink of the $ i $ -th student. The drink types are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ k $ .\n\nThere are infinite number of drink sets. Each set consists of exactly two portions of the same drink. In other words, there are $ k $ types of drink sets, the $ j $ -th type contains two portions of the drink $ j $ . The available number of sets of each of the $ k $ types is infinite.\n\nYou know that students will receive the minimum possible number of sets to give all students exactly one drink. Obviously, the number of sets will be exactly $ \\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil $ , where $ \\lceil x \\rceil $ is $ x $ rounded up.\n\nAfter students receive the sets, they will distribute their portions by their choice: each student will get exactly one portion. Note, that if $ n $ is odd then one portion will remain unused and the students' teacher will drink it.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of students that can get their favorite drink if $ \\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil $ sets will be chosen optimally and students will distribute portions between themselves optimally?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le n, k \\le 1\\,000 $ ) \u2014 the number of students in the building and the number of different drinks.\n\nThe next $ n $ lines contain student's favorite drinks. The $ i $ -th line contains a single integer from $ 1 $ to $ k $ \u2014 the type of the favorite drink of the $ i $ -th student.",
    "outputFormat": "Print exactly one integer \u2014 the maximum number of students that can get a favorite drink.",

    "hint": "In the first example, students could choose three sets with drinks $ 1 $ , $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ (so they will have two sets with two drinks of the type $ 1 $ each and one set with two drinks of the type $ 2 $ , so portions will be $ 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2 $ ). This way all students except the second one will get their favorite drinks.\n\nAnother possible answer is sets with drinks $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ . In this case the portions will be $ 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3 $ . Then all the students except one will gain their favorite drinks. The only student that will not gain the favorite drink will be a student with $ a_i = 1 $ (i.e. the first, the third or the fourth).",
