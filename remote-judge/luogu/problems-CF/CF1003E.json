    "description": "You are given three integers $ n $ , $ d $ and $ k $ .\n\nYour task is to construct an undirected tree on $ n $ vertices with diameter $ d $ and degree of each vertex at most $ k $ , or say that it is impossible.\n\nAn undirected tree is a connected undirected graph with $ n - 1 $ edges.\n\nDiameter of a tree is the maximum length of a simple path (a path in which each vertex appears at most once) between all pairs of vertices of this tree.\n\nDegree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to this vertex (i.e. for a vertex $ u $ it is the number of edges $ (u, v) $ that belong to the tree, where $ v $ is any other vertex of a tree).",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains three integers $ n $ , $ d $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le n, d, k \\le 4 \\cdot 10^5 $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "If there is no tree satisfying the conditions above, print only one word \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\nOtherwise in the first line print \"YES\" (without quotes), and then print $ n - 1 $ lines describing edges of a tree satisfying the conditions above. Vertices of the tree must be numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . You can print edges and vertices connected by an edge in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
