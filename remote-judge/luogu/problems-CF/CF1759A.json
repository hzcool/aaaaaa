    "description": "You talked to Polycarp and asked him a question. You know that when he wants to answer \"yes\", he repeats Yes many times in a row.\n\nBecause of the noise, you only heard part of the answer \u2014 some substring of it. That is, if he answered YesYes, then you could hear esY, YesYes, sYes, e, but you couldn't Yess, YES or se.\n\nDetermine if it is true that the given string $ s $ is a substring of YesYesYes... (Yes repeated many times in a row).",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input data contains the singular $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nEach test case is described by a single string of Latin letters $ s $ ( $ 1 \\le |s| \\le 50 $ ) \u2014 the part of Polycarp's answer that you heard, where $ |s| $ \u2014 is the length of the string $ s $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Output $ t $ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As an answer, output \"YES\" if the specified string $ s $ is a substring of the string YesYesYes...Yes (the number of words Yes is arbitrary), and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).",
