    "description": "You are given a permutation $ p $ of integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , where $ n $ is an even number.\n\nYour goal is to sort the permutation. To do so, you can perform zero or more operations of the following type:\n\n- take two indices $ i $ and $ j $ such that $ 2 \\cdot |i - j| \\geq n $ and swap $ p_i $ and $ p_j $ .\n\nThere is no need to minimize the number of operations, however you should use no more than $ 5 \\cdot n $ operations. One can show that it is always possible to do that.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5 $ , $ n $ is even) \u2014 the length of the permutation.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ distinct integers $ p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n $ ( $ 1 \\le p_i \\le n $ ) \u2014 the given permutation.",
    "outputFormat": "On the first line print $ m $ ( $ 0 \\le m \\le 5 \\cdot n $ ) \u2014 the number of swaps to perform.\n\nEach of the following $ m $ lines should contain integers $ a_i, b_i $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le n $ , $ |a_i - b_i| \\ge \\frac{n}{2} $ ) \u2014 the indices that should be swapped in the corresponding swap.\n\nNote that there is no need to minimize the number of operations. We can show that an answer always exists.",
