    "description": "The girl Umka loves to travel and participate in math olympiads. One day she was flying by plane to the next olympiad and out of boredom explored a huge checkered sheet of paper.\n\nDenote the $ n $ -th Fibonacci number as $ F_n = \\begin{cases} 1, & n = 0; \\\\ 1, & n = 1; \\\\ F_{n-2} + F_{n-1}, & n \\ge 2. \\end{cases} $\n\nA checkered rectangle with a height of $ F_n $ and a width of $ F_{n+1} $ is called a Fibonacci rectangle of order $ n $ .\n\nUmka has a Fibonacci rectangle of order $ n $ . Someone colored a cell in it at the intersection of the row $ x $ and the column $ y $ .\n\nIt is necessary to cut this rectangle exactly into $ n+1 $ squares in such way that\n\n- the painted cell was in a square with a side of $ 1 $ ;\n- there was at most one pair of squares with equal sides;\n- the side of each square was equal to a Fibonacci number.\n\nWill Umka be able to cut this rectangle in that way?",
