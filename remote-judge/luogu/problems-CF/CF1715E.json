    "description": "Stanley lives in a country that consists of $ n $ cities (he lives in city $ 1 $ ). There are bidirectional roads between some of the cities, and you know how long it takes to ride through each of them. Additionally, there is a flight between each pair of cities, the flight between cities $ u $ and $ v $ takes $ (u - v)^2 $ time.\n\nStanley is quite afraid of flying because of watching \"Sully: Miracle on the Hudson\" recently, so he can take at most $ k $ flights. Stanley wants to know the minimum time of a journey to each of the $ n $ cities from the city $ 1 $ .",
    "inputFormat": "In the first line of input there are three integers $ n $ , $ m $ , and $ k $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 10^{5} $ , $ 1 \\leq m \\leq 10^{5} $ , $ 1 \\leq k \\leq 20 $ ) \u2014 the number of cities, the number of roads, and the maximal number of flights Stanley can take.\n\nThe following $ m $ lines describe the roads. Each contains three integers $ u $ , $ v $ , $ w $ ( $ 1 \\leq u, v \\leq n $ , $ u \\neq v $ , $ 1 \\leq w \\leq 10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the cities the road connects and the time it takes to ride through. Note that some pairs of cities may be connected by more than one road.",

To get to city 2 Stanley should use a flight between 1 and 2, which will take 1 unit of time. To get to city 3 Stanley can ride between cities 1 and 2, which will take 3 units of time, and then use a flight between 2 and 3. To get to city 4 Stanley should use a flight between 1 and 2, then take a ride from 2 to 4, which will take 5 units of time.",
