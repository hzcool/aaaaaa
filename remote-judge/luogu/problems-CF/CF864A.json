    "description": "Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have $ n $ cards ( $ n $ is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.\n\nBefore the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number $ 5 $ before the game he will take all cards on which $ 5 $ is written and if Vasya chose number $ 10 $ before the game he will take all cards on which $ 10 $ is written.\n\nThe game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all $ n $ cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.\n\nDetermine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=100 $ ) \u2014 number of cards. It is guaranteed that $ n $ is an even number.\n\nThe following $ n $ lines contain a sequence of integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ (one integer per line, $ 1<=a_{i}<=100 $ ) \u2014 numbers written on the $ n $ cards.",
    "outputFormat": "If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print \"NO\" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.\n\nIn the other case print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers \u2014 number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.",

    "hint": "In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number $ 11 $ , and Vasya chooses number $ 27 $ . Then the will take all cards \u2014 Petya will take cards $ 1 $ and $ 4 $ , and Vasya will take cards $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ . Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.\n\nIn the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.\n\nIn the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards \u2014 for example, Petya can choose number $ 10 $ and Vasya can choose number $ 20 $ . But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take $ 6 $ cards.",
