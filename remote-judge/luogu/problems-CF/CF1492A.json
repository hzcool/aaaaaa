    "description": "Three swimmers decided to organize a party in the swimming pool! At noon, they started to swim from the left side of the pool.\n\nIt takes the first swimmer exactly $ a $ minutes to swim across the entire pool and come back, exactly $ b $ minutes for the second swimmer and $ c $ minutes for the third. Hence, the first swimmer will be on the left side of the pool after $ 0 $ , $ a $ , $ 2a $ , $ 3a $ , ... minutes after the start time, the second one will be at $ 0 $ , $ b $ , $ 2b $ , $ 3b $ , ... minutes, and the third one will be on the left side of the pool after $ 0 $ , $ c $ , $ 2c $ , $ 3c $ , ... minutes.\n\nYou came to the left side of the pool exactly $ p $ minutes after they started swimming. Determine how long you have to wait before one of the swimmers arrives at the left side of the pool.",
