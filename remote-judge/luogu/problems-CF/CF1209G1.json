    "description": "This is an easier version of the next problem. In this version, $ q = 0 $ .\n\nA sequence of integers is called nice if its elements are arranged in blocks like in $ [3, 3, 3, 4, 1, 1] $ . Formally, if two elements are equal, everything in between must also be equal.\n\nLet's define difficulty of a sequence as a minimum possible number of elements to change to get a nice sequence. However, if you change at least one element of value $ x $ to value $ y $ , you must also change all other elements of value $ x $ into $ y $ as well. For example, for $ [3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2] $ it isn't allowed to change first $ 1 $ to $ 3 $ and second $ 1 $ to $ 2 $ . You need to leave $ 1 $ 's untouched or change them to the same value.\n\nYou are given a sequence of integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ and $ q $ updates.\n\nEach update is of form \" $ i $ $ x $ \" \u2014 change $ a_i $ to $ x $ . Updates are not independent (the change stays for the future).\n\nPrint the difficulty of the initial sequence and of the sequence after every update.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 200\\,000 $ , $ q = 0 $ ), the length of the sequence and the number of the updates.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 200\\,000 $ ), the initial sequence.\n\nEach of the following $ q $ lines contains integers $ i_t $ and $ x_t $ ( $ 1 \\le i_t \\le n $ , $ 1 \\le x_t \\le 200\\,000 $ ), the position and the new value for this position.",
