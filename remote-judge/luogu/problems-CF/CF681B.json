    "description": "Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to $ 0 $ .\n\nKolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to $ n $ and that he have bought only some houses (for $ 1234567 $ game-coins each), cars (for $ 123456 $ game-coins each) and computers (for $ 1234 $ game-coins each).\n\nKolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial $ n $ game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ such that $ a\u00d71234567+b\u00d7123456+c\u00d71234=n $ ?\n\nPlease help Kolya answer this question.",
