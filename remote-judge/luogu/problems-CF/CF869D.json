Koyomi knows it.\n\nThe bees, according to their nature, live in a tree. To be more specific, a complete binary tree with $ n $ nodes numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The node numbered $ 1 $ is the root, and the parent of the $ i $ -th ( $ 2<=i<=n $ ) node is ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF869D/243a7927a8a18b5fcb0b3b3881b8ba0f7e764401.png). Note that, however, all edges in the tree are undirected.\n\nKoyomi adds $ m $ extra undirected edges to the tree, creating more complication to trick the bees. And you're here to count the number of simple paths in the resulting graph, modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ . A simple path is an alternating sequence of adjacent nodes and undirected edges, which begins and ends with nodes and does not contain any node more than once. Do note that a single node is also considered a valid simple path under this definition. Please refer to the examples and notes below for instances.",
