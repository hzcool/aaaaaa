Let's define their cartesian product $ T_1 \\times T_2 $ in a following way.\n\nLet $ V $ be the set of vertices in $ T_1 $ and $ U $ be the set of vertices in $ T_2 $ .\n\nThen the set of vertices of graph $ T_1 \\times T_2 $ is $ V \\times U $ , that is, a set of ordered pairs of vertices, where the first vertex in pair is from $ V $ and the second \u2014 from $ U $ .\n\nLet's draw the following edges:\n\n- Between $ (v, u_1) $ and $ (v, u_2) $ there is an undirected edge, if $ u_1 $ and $ u_2 $ are adjacent in $ U $ .\n- Similarly, between $ (v_1, u) $ and $ (v_2, u) $ there is an undirected edge, if $ v_1 $ and $ v_2 $ are adjacent in $ V $ .\n\nPlease see the notes section for the pictures of products of trees in the sample tests.\n\nLet's examine the graph $ T_1 \\times T_2 $ . How much cycles (not necessarily simple) of length $ k $ it contains? Since this number can be very large, print it modulo $ 998244353 $ .\n\nThe sequence of vertices $ w_1 $ , $ w_2 $ , ..., $ w_k $ , where $ w_i \\in V \\times U $ called cycle, if any neighboring vertices are adjacent and $ w_1 $ is adjacent to $ w_k $ . Cycles that differ only by the cyclic shift or direction of traversal are still considered different.",

Each of this lines contains two integers \u2014 $ v_i, u_i $ ( $ 1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n_1 $ ), which define edges of the first tree.\n\nThen follow $ n_2 - 1 $ lines, which describe the second tree in the same format.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that given graphs are trees.",
