    "description": "You are given a text consisting of $ n $ lines. Each line contains some space-separated words, consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nWe define a syllable as a string that contains exactly one vowel and any arbitrary number (possibly none) of consonants. In English alphabet following letters are considered to be vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and 'y'.\n\nEach word of the text that contains at least one vowel can be divided into syllables. Each character should be a part of exactly one syllable. For example, the word \"mamma\" can be divided into syllables as \"ma\" and \"mma\", \"mam\" and \"ma\", and \"mamm\" and \"a\". Words that consist of only consonants should be ignored.\n\nThe verse patterns for the given text is a sequence of $ n $ integers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ . Text matches the given verse pattern if for each $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ one can divide words of the $ i $ -th line in syllables in such a way that the total number of syllables is equal to $ p_{i} $ .\n\nYou are given the text and the verse pattern. Check, if the given text matches the given verse pattern.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) \u2014 the number of lines in the text.\n\nThe second line contains integers $ p_{1},...,p_{n} $ ( $ 0<=p_{i}<=100 $ ) \u2014 the verse pattern.\n\nNext $ n $ lines contain the text itself. Text consists of lowercase English letters and spaces. It's guaranteed that all lines are non-empty, each line starts and ends with a letter and words are separated by exactly one space. The length of each line doesn't exceed $ 100 $ characters.",
