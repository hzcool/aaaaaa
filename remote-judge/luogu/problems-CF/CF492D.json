Vanya's character performs attack with frequency $ x $ hits per second and Vova's character performs attack with frequency $ y $ hits per second. Each character spends fixed time to raise a weapon and then he hits (the time to raise the weapon is $ 1/x $ seconds for the first character and $ 1/y $ seconds for the second one). The $ i $ -th monster dies after he receives $ a_{i} $ hits.\n\nVanya and Vova wonder who makes the last hit on each monster.
