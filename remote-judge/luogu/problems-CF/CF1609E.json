During his education an interesting situation happened, after which William started to listen to homework assignments much more attentively. What follows is a formal description of the homework assignment as William heard it:\n\nYou are given a string $ s $ of length $ n $ only consisting of characters \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\". There are $ q $ queries of format ( $ pos, c $ ), meaning replacing the element of string $ s $ at position $ pos $ with character $ c $ . After each query you must output the minimal number of characters in the string, which have to be replaced, so that the string doesn't contain string \"abc\" as a subsequence. A valid replacement of a character is replacing it with \"a\", \"b\" or \"c\".\n\nA string $ x $ is said to be a subsequence of string $ y $ if $ x $ can be obtained from $ y $ by deleting some characters without changing the ordering of the remaining characters.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ q $ $ (1 \\le n, q \\le 10^5) $ , the length of the string and the number of queries, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains the string $ s $ , consisting of characters \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\".\n\nEach of the next $ q $ lines contains an integer $ i $ and character $ c $ $ (1 \\le i \\le n) $ , index and the value of the new item in the string, respectively. It is guaranteed that character's $ c $ value is \"a\", \"b\" or \"c\".",
    "outputFormat": "For each query output the minimal number of characters that would have to be replaced so that the string doesn't contain \"abc\" as a subsequence.",
    "samples": [
        [
            "9 12\naaabccccc\n4 a\n4 b\n2 b\n5 a\n1 b\n6 b\n5 c\n2 a\n1 a\n5 a\n6 b\n7 b",
            "0\n1\n2\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2"
        ]
    ],
    "hint": "Let's consider the state of the string after each query:\n\n1. $ s =  $ \"aaaaccccc\". In this case the string does not contain \"abc\" as a subsequence and no replacements are needed.\n2. $ s =  $ \"aaabccccc\". In this case 1 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s =  $ \"aaaaccccc\". This string does not contain \"abc\" as a subsequence.\n3. $ s =  $ \"ababccccc\". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s =  $ aaaaccccc\". This string does not contain \"abc\" as a subsequence.\n4. $ s =  $ \"ababacccc\". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s =  $ \"aaaaacccc\". This string does not contain \"abc\" as a subsequence.\n5. $ s =  $ \"bbabacccc\".

In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s =  $ \"bbbbcbccc\". This string does not contain \"abc\" as a subsequence.\n9. $ s =  $ \"aaabcbccc\".
