Here is a pseudocode of filling in a matrix of size $ (m+1)\u00d7(m+1) $ :\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF261C/2ee53d83c775f11a8b5c62a496d38d42095666d0.png)\n\nMaxim asks you to count, how many numbers $ m $ $ (1<=m<=n) $ are there, such that the sum of values in the cells in the row number $ m+1 $ of the resulting matrix equals $ t $ .\n\nExpression ( $ x $ $ xor $ $ y $ ) means applying the operation of bitwise excluding \"OR\" to numbers $ x $ and $ y $ . The given operation exists in all modern programming languages. For example, in languages C++ and Java it is represented by character \"^\", in Pascal \u2014 by \"xor\".",
