    "description": "You are given two positive integers $ a $ and $ b $ . In one move you can increase $ a $ by $ 1 $ (replace $ a $ with $ a+1 $ ). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make $ a $ divisible by $ b $ . It is possible, that you have to make $ 0 $ moves, as $ a $ is already divisible by $ b $ . You have to answer $ t $ independent test cases.",
