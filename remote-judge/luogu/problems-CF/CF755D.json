    "description": "PolandBall has such a convex polygon with $ n $ veritces that no three of its diagonals intersect at the same point. PolandBall decided to improve it and draw some red segments.\n\nHe chose a number $ k $ such that $ gcd(n,k)=1 $ . Vertices of the polygon are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in a clockwise way. PolandBall repeats the following process $ n $ times, starting from the vertex $ 1 $ :\n\nAssume you've ended last operation in vertex $ x $ (consider $ x=1 $ if it is the first operation). Draw a new segment from vertex $ x $ to $ k $ -th next vertex in clockwise direction. This is a vertex $ x+k $ or $ x+k-n $ depending on which of these is a valid index of polygon's vertex.\n\nYour task is to calculate number of polygon's sections after each drawing. A section is a clear area inside the polygon bounded with drawn diagonals or the polygon's sides.",
    "inputFormat": "There are only two numbers in the input: $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 5<=n<=10^{6} $ , $ 2<=k<=n-2 $ , $ gcd(n,k)=1 $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "You should print $ n $ values separated by spaces. The $ i $ -th value should represent number of polygon's sections after drawing first $ i $ lines.",

    "hint": "The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers $ a $ and $ b $ is the largest positive integer that divides both $ a $ and $ b $ without a remainder.\n\nFor the first sample testcase, you should output \"2 3 5 8 11\".
