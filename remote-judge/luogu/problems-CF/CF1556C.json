Since his favorite sequence is quite big he provided it to you as a sequence of positive integers $ c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n $ where $ c_i $ is the number of consecutive brackets \"(\" if $ i $ is an odd number or the number of consecutive brackets \")\" if $ i $ is an even number.\n\nFor example for a bracket sequence \"((())()))\" a corresponding sequence of numbers is $ [3, 2, 1, 3] $ .\n\nYou need to find the total number of continuous subsequences (subsegments) $ [l, r] $ ( $ l \\le r $ ) of the original bracket sequence, which are regular bracket sequences.\n\nA bracket sequence is called regular if it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \"+\" and \"1\" into this sequence. For example, sequences \"(())()\", \"()\" and \"(()(()))\" are regular, while \")(\", \"(()\" and \"(()))(\" are not.",
