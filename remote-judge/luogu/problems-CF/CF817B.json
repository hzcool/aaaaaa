    "description": "After returning from the army Makes received a gift \u2014 an array $ a $ consisting of $ n $ positive integer numbers. He hadn't been solving problems for a long time, so he became interested to answer a particular question: how many triples of indices $ (i,\u00a0j,\u00a0k) $ ( $ i&lt;j&lt;k $ ), such that $ a_{i}\u00b7a_{j}\u00b7a_{k} $ is minimum possible, are there in the array? Help him with it!",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a positive integer number $ n\u00a0(3<=n<=10^{5}) $ \u2014 the number of elements in array $ a $ . The second line contains $ n $ positive integer numbers $ a_{i}\u00a0(1<=a_{i}<=10^{9}) $ \u2014 the elements of a given array.",

Since there are two ways to choose an element $ 3 $ , then the answer is $ 2 $ .\n\nIn the third example a triple of numbers $ (1,1,2) $ is chosen, and there's only one way to choose indices.",
