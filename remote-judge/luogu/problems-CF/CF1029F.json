    "description": "There is an infinite board of square tiles. Initially all tiles are white.\n\nVova has a red marker and a blue marker. Red marker can color $ a $ tiles. Blue marker can color $ b $ tiles. If some tile isn't white then you can't use marker of any color on it. Each marker must be drained completely, so at the end there should be exactly $ a $ red tiles and exactly $ b $ blue tiles across the board.\n\nVova wants to color such a set of tiles that:\n\n- they would form a rectangle, consisting of exactly $ a+b $ colored tiles;\n- all tiles of at least one color would also form a rectangle.\n\nHere are some examples of correct colorings:\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1029F/4e60c629e360885141e5179d3d4cdaf35671b392.png)Here are some examples of incorrect colorings:\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1029F/8bb11d3a5c5094b0326713ae6edbddbecf3531f0.png)Among all correct colorings Vova wants to choose the one with the minimal perimeter. What is the minimal perimeter Vova can obtain?\n\nIt is guaranteed that there exists at least one correct coloring.",
