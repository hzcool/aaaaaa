During his education an interesting situation happened, after which William started to listen to homework assignments much more attentively. What follows is the correct formal description of the homework assignment:\n\nYou are given a string $ s $ of length $ n $ only consisting of characters \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\". There are $ q $ queries of format ( $ pos, c $ ), meaning replacing the element of string $ s $ at position $ pos $ with character $ c $ . After each query you must output the minimal number of characters in the string, which have to be replaced, so that the string doesn't contain string \"abc\" as a substring. A valid replacement of a character is replacing it with \"a\", \"b\" or \"c\".\n\nA string $ x $ is a substring of a string $ y $ if $ x $ can be obtained from $ y $ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ q $ $ (1 \\le n, q \\le 10^5) $ , the length of the string and the number of queries, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains the string $ s $ , consisting of characters \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\".\n\nEach of the next $ q $ lines contains an integer $ i $ and character $ c $ $ (1 \\le i \\le n) $ , index and the value of the new item in the string, respectively. It is guaranteed that character's $ c $ value is \"a\", \"b\" or \"c\".",
    "outputFormat": "For each query output the minimal number of characters that would have to be replaced so that the string doesn't contain \"abc\" as a substring.",
    "samples": [
        [
            "9 10\nabcabcabc\n1 a\n1 b\n2 c\n3 a\n4 b\n5 c\n8 a\n9 b\n1 c\n4 a",
            "3\n2\n2\n2\n1\n2\n1\n1\n1\n0"
        ]
    ],
    "hint": "Let's consider the state of the string after each query:\n\n1. $ s = $ \"abcabcabc\". In this case $ 3 $ replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s = $ \"bbcaccabb\". This string does not contain \"abc\" as a substring.\n2. $ s = $ \"bbcabcabc\". In this case $ 2 $ replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s = $ \"bbcbbcbbc\". This string does not contain \"abc\" as a substring.\n3. $ s = $ \"bccabcabc\". In this case $ 2 $ replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s = $ \"bccbbcbbc\". This string does not contain \"abc\" as a substring.\n4. $ s = $ \"bcaabcabc\". In this case $ 2 $ replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s = $ \"bcabbcbbc\". This string does not contain \"abc\" as a substring.\n5. $ s = $ \"bcabbcabc\". In this case $ 1 $ replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s = $ \"bcabbcabb\".

This string does not contain \"abc\" as a substring.\n7. $ s = $ \"bcabccaac\". In this case $ 1 $ replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s = $ \"bcabbcaac\". This string does not contain \"abc\" as a substring.\n8. $ s = $ \"bcabccaab\". In this case $ 1 $ replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s = $ \"bcabbcaab\". This string does not contain \"abc\" as a substring.\n9. $ s = $ \"ccabccaab\". In this case $ 1 $ replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s = $ \"ccabbcaab\". This string does not contain \"abc\" as a substring.\n10. $ s = $ \"ccaaccaab\". In this case the string does not contain \"abc\" as a substring and no replacements are needed.",
