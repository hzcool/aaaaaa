    "description": "Just in case somebody missed it: we have wonderful girls in Arpa\u2019s land.\n\nArpa has a rooted tree (connected acyclic graph) consisting of $ n $ vertices. The vertices are numbered $ 1 $ through $ n $ , the vertex $ 1 $ is the root. There is a letter written on each edge of this tree. Mehrdad is a fan of Dokhtar-kosh things. He call a string Dokhtar-kosh, if we can shuffle the characters in string such that it becomes palindrome.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF741D/ae6eaea25c446dd1a9c02c7621129601f3a81ec1.png)He asks Arpa, for each vertex $ v $ , what is the length of the longest simple path in subtree of $ v $ that form a Dokhtar-kosh string.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=5\u00b710^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\n $ (n-1) $ lines follow, the $ i $ -th of them contain an integer $ p_{i+1} $ and a letter $ c_{i+1} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i+1}<=i $ , $ c_{i+1} $ is lowercase English letter, between a and v, inclusively), that mean that there is an edge between nodes $ p_{i+1} $ and $ i+1 $ and there is a letter $ c_{i+1} $ written on this edge.",
