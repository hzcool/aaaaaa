    "description": "Polycarpus loves hamburgers very much. He especially adores the hamburgers he makes with his own hands. Polycarpus thinks that there are only three decent ingredients to make hamburgers from: a bread, sausage and cheese. He writes down the recipe of his favorite \"Le Hamburger de Polycarpus\" as a string of letters 'B' (bread), 'S' (sausage) \u0438 'C' (cheese). The ingredients in the recipe go from bottom to top, for example, recipe \"\u0412SCBS\" represents the hamburger where the ingredients go from bottom to top as bread, sausage, cheese, bread and sausage again.\n\nPolycarpus has $ n_{b} $ pieces of bread, $ n_{s} $ pieces of sausage and $ n_{c} $ pieces of cheese in the kitchen. Besides, the shop nearby has all three ingredients, the prices are $ p_{b} $ rubles for a piece of bread, $ p_{s} $ for a piece of sausage and $ p_{c} $ for a piece of cheese.\n\nPolycarpus has $ r $ rubles and he is ready to shop on them. What maximum number of hamburgers can he cook? You can assume that Polycarpus cannot break or slice any of the pieces of bread, sausage or cheese. Besides, the shop has an unlimited number of pieces of each ingredient.",

The length of the string doesn't exceed 100, the string contains only letters 'B' (uppercase English B), 'S' (uppercase English S) and 'C' (uppercase English C).\n\nThe second line contains three integers $ n_{b} $ , $ n_{s} $ , $ n_{c} $ ( $ 1<=n_{b},n_{s},n_{c}<=100 $ ) \u2014 the number of the pieces of bread, sausage and cheese on Polycarpus' kitchen. The third line contains three integers $ p_{b} $ , $ p_{s} $ , $ p_{c} $ ( $ 1<=p_{b},p_{s},p_{c}<=100 $ ) \u2014 the price of one piece of bread, sausage and cheese in the shop. Finally, the fourth line contains integer $ r $ ( $ 1<=r<=10^{12} $ ) \u2014 the number of rubles Polycarpus has.\n\nPlease, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++.
