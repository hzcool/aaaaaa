    "description": "In order to make the capital of Berland a more attractive place for tourists, the great king came up with the following plan: choose two streets of the city and call them avenues. Certainly, these avenues will be proclaimed extremely important historical places, which should attract tourists from all over the world.\n\nThe capital of Berland can be represented as a graph, the vertices of which are crossroads, and the edges are streets connecting two crossroads. In total, there are $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges in the graph, you can move in both directions along any street, you can get from any crossroad to any other by moving only along the streets, each street connects two different crossroads, and no two streets connect the same pair of crossroads.\n\nIn order to reduce the flow of ordinary citizens moving along the great avenues, it was decided to introduce a toll on each avenue in both directions. Now you need to pay $ 1 $ tugrik for one passage along the avenue. You don't have to pay for the rest of the streets.\n\nAnalysts have collected a sample of $ k $ citizens, $ i $ -th of them needs to go to work from the crossroad $ a_i $ to the crossroad $ b_i $ . After two avenues are chosen, each citizen will go to work along the path with minimal cost.\n\nIn order to earn as much money as possible, it was decided to choose two streets as two avenues, so that the total number of tugriks paid by these $ k $ citizens is maximized. Help the king: according to the given scheme of the city and a sample of citizens, find out which two streets should be made avenues, and how many tugriks the citizens will pay according to this choice.",

It is guaranteed that no two streets connect the same pair of crossroads, you can get from any crossroad to any other by moving only along the streets.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer $ k $ ( $ 1 \\leq k \\leq 500\\,000 $ ) \u2014 the amount of citizens in the sample.\n\nThe next $ k $ lines contain the description of citizens, $ i $ -th line contains two integers $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ ( $ 1 \\leq a_i, b_i \\leq n $ , $ a_i \\neq b_i $ ) \u2014 $ i $ -th citizen goes to work from crossroad $ a_i $ to crossroad $ b_i $ .\n\nLet $ M $ be the sum of $ m $ over all test cases and $ K $ be the sum of $ k $ over all test cases.
