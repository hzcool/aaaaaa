    "description": "After some programming contest Roma decided to try himself in tourism. His home country Uzhlyandia is a Cartesian plane. He wants to walk along each of the Main Straight Lines in Uzhlyandia. It is known that each of these lines is a straight line parallel to one of the axes (i.e. it is described with the equation $ x=a $ or $ y=a $ , where $ a $ is integer called the coordinate of this line).\n\nRoma lost his own map, so he should find out the coordinates of all lines at first. Uncle Anton agreed to help him, using the following rules:\n\n- Initially Roma doesn't know the number of vertical and horizontal lines and their coordinates;\n- Roma can announce integer coordinates of some point in Uzhlandia, and Anton then will tell him the minimum among the distances from the chosen point to each of the lines. However, since the coordinates of the lines don't exceed $ 10^{8} $ by absolute value, Roma can't choose a point with coordinates exceeding $ 10^{8} $ by absolute value.\n\nUncle Anton is in a hurry to the UOI (Uzhlandian Olympiad in Informatics), so he can only answer no more than $ 3\u00b710^{5} $ questions.\n\nThe problem is that Roma doesn't know how to find out the coordinates of the lines. Write a program that plays Roma's role and finds the coordinates.",
    "inputFormat": "There is no input initially. Your program should make queries to get information.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the number of horizontal and vertical lines is at least $ 1 $ and less than or equal to $ 10^{4} $ for each type.",
    "outputFormat": "To make a query, print a line \"0 x y\" (- $ 10^{8}<=x,y<=10^{8} $ ), where $ x $ and $ y $ are the coordinates of the point. After each query you need to print end-of-line, make \"flush\" operation, and then read the answer to the query \u2014 the minimum among the distances prom this point to the Main Straight Lines of Uzhlyandia.\n\nYou can do no more than $ 3\u00b710^{5} $ queries.\n\nWhen you are ready to print the answer, print three lines:\n\n1. In the first line print \"1 n m\", where $ n $ is the number of vertical lines (parallel to $ OY $ ), and $ m $ is the number of horizontal lines (parallel to $ OX $ ).\n2. In the second line print $ n $ integers $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n} $ \u2014 the coordinates of the vertical lines.\n3. In the third line in the same format print $ m $ integers $ y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{m} $ \u2014 the coordinates of the horizontal lines.\n\nYou can print coordinates in arbitrary order.\n\nTo make \"flush\", you can use (just after printing a query/answer and end-of-line):\n\n- fflush(stdout) in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nYou will get Wrong Answer if you make more queries than allowed or make an invalid query.\n\nYou can get Idleness Limit Exceeded if you don't print anything or if you forget to flush the output.\n\nIf at any moment your program reads -1 as an answer, it should immediately exit normally (for example, by calling exit(0)). You will get Wrong Answer in this case, it means that you made more queries than allowed, or made an invalid query. If you ignore this, you can get other verdicts since your program will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nMaking test for hacking\n\nThe first line should contain two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=10^{4} $ ).\n\nThe second line should contain $ n $ distinct integers $ x_{i} $ (- $ 10^{8}<=x_{i}<=10^{8} $ ) \u2014 the coordinates of the vertical lines.\n\nThe third line should contain $ m $ distinct integers $ y_{i} $ (- $ 10^{8}<=y_{i}<=10^{8} $ ) \u2014 the coordinates of the horizontal lines.\n\nYou can write coordinates in arbitrary order.\n\nYou can see the example case in the notes.",
