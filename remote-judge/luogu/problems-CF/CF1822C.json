    "description": "Tema loves cinnabon rolls \u2014 buns with cinnabon and chocolate in the shape of a \"snail\".\n\nCinnabon rolls come in different sizes and are square when viewed from above. The most delicious part of a roll is the chocolate, which is poured in a thin layer over the cinnabon roll in the form of a spiral and around the bun, as in the following picture:\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1822C/ffc1c1654f069b6dc40f3daa75316ce608e668a4.png) Cinnabon rolls of sizes 4, 5, 6\n\nFor a cinnabon roll of size $ n $ , the length of the outer side of the square is $ n $ , and the length of the shortest vertical chocolate segment in the central part is one.\n\nFormally, the bun consists of two dough spirals separated by chocolate. A cinnabon roll of size $ n + 1 $ is obtained from a cinnabon roll of size $ n $ by wrapping each of the dough spirals around the cinnabon roll for another layer.\n\nIt is important that a cinnabon roll of size $ n $ is defined in a unique way.\n\nTema is interested in how much chocolate is in his cinnabon roll of size $ n $ . Since Tema has long stopped buying small cinnabon rolls, it is guaranteed that $ n \\ge 4 $ .\n\nAnswer this non-obvious question by calculating the total length of the chocolate layer.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe following $ t $ lines describe the test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by a single integer $ n $ ( $ 4 \\le n \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the size of the cinnabon roll.",
    "outputFormat": "Output $ t $ integers. The $ i $ -th of them should be equal to the total length of the chocolate layer in the $ i $ -th test case.",
