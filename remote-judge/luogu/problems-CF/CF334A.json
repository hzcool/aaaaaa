    "description": "Gerald has $ n $ younger brothers and their number happens to be even. One day he bought $ n^{2} $ candy bags. One bag has one candy, one bag has two candies, one bag has three candies and so on. In fact, for each integer $ k $ from $ 1 $ to $ n^{2} $ he has exactly one bag with $ k $ candies.\n\nHelp him give $ n $ bags of candies to each brother so that all brothers got the same number of candies.",
    "inputFormat": "The single line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ n $ is even, $ 2<=n<=100 $ ) \u2014 the number of Gerald's brothers.",
    "outputFormat": "Let's assume that Gerald indexes his brothers with numbers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . You need to print $ n $ lines, on the $ i $ -th line print $ n $ integers \u2014 the numbers of candies in the bags for the $ i $ -th brother. Naturally, all these numbers should be distinct and be within limits from $ 1 $ to $ n^{2} $ . You can print the numbers in the lines in any order.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the solution exists at the given limits.",

    ],
    "hint": "The sample shows Gerald's actions if he has two brothers. In this case, his bags contain 1, 2, 3 and 4 candies. He can give the bags with 1 and 4 candies to one brother and the bags with 2 and 3 to the other brother.",
