    "description": "Misha had been banned from playing chess for good since he was accused of cheating with an engine. Therefore, he retired and decided to become a xorcerer.\n\nOne day, while taking a walk in a park, Misha came across a rooted tree with nodes numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The root of the tree is node $ 1 $ .\n\nFor each $ 1\\le i\\le n $ , node $ i $ contains $ a_i $ stones in it. Misha has recently learned a new spell in his xorcery class and wants to test it out. A spell consists of:\n\n- Choose some node $ i $ ( $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n $ ).\n- Calculate the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) $ x $ of all $ a_j $ such that node $ j $ is in the subtree of $ i $ ( $ i $ belongs to its own subtree).\n- Set $ a_j $ equal to $ x $ for all nodes $ j $ in the subtree of $ i $ .\n\nMisha can perform at most $ 2n $ spells and he wants to remove all stones from the tree. More formally, he wants $ a_i=0 $ to hold for each $ 1\\leq i \\leq n $ . Can you help him perform the spells?\n\nA tree with $ n $ nodes is a connected acyclic graph which contains $ n-1 $ edges. The subtree of node $ i $ is the set of all nodes $ j $ such that $ i $ lies on the simple path from $ 1 $ (the root) to $ j $ . We consider $ i $ to be contained in its own subtree.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the size of the tree\n\nThe second line contains an array of integers $ a_1,a_2,\\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \\leq a_i \\leq 31 $ ), describing the number of stones in each node initially.\n\nThe third line contains an array of integers $ p_2,p_3,\\ldots, p_n $ ( $ 1 \\leq p_i \\leq i-1 $ ), where $ p_i $ means that there is an edge connecting $ p_i $ and $ i $ .",
    "outputFormat": "If there is not a valid sequence of spells, output $ -1 $ .\n\nOtherwise, output a single integer $ q $ ( $ 0 \\leq q \\leq 2n $ ) in the first line \u2014 the number of performed spells.\n\nIn the second line output a sequence of integers $ v_1,v_2,\\ldots,v_q $ ( $ 1 \\leq v_i \\leq n $ ) \u2014 the $ i $ -th spell will be performed on the subtree of node $ v_i $ . Please note that order matters.\n\nIf multiple solutions exist, output any. You don't have to minimize the number of operations.",
