    "description": "A bracket sequence is called regular if it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \u00ab+\u00bb and \u00ab1\u00bb into this sequence. For example, sequences \u00ab(())()\u00bb, \u00ab()\u00bb and \u00ab(()(()))\u00bb are regular, while \u00ab)(\u00bb, \u00ab(()\u00bb and \u00ab(()))(\u00bb are not.\n\nOne day Johnny got bracket sequence. He decided to remove some of the brackets from it in order to obtain a regular bracket sequence. What is the maximum length of a regular bracket sequence which can be obtained?",
    "inputFormat": "Input consists of a single line with non-empty string of \u00ab(\u00bb and \u00ab)\u00bb characters. Its length does not exceed $ 10^{6} $ .",
