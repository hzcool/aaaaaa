    "description": "Vasya lives in a round building, whose entrances are numbered sequentially by integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Entrance $ n $ and entrance $ 1 $ are adjacent.\n\nToday Vasya got bored and decided to take a walk in the yard. Vasya lives in entrance $ a $ and he decided that during his walk he will move around the house $ b $ entrances in the direction of increasing numbers (in this order entrance $ n $ should be followed by entrance $ 1 $ ). The negative value of $ b $ corresponds to moving $ |b| $ entrances in the order of decreasing numbers (in this order entrance $ 1 $ is followed by entrance $ n $ ). If $ b=0 $ , then Vasya prefers to walk beside his entrance.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF659A/8f09e360c1ff5dc88f6cd354c32b2183ba63a907.png)Illustration for $ n=6 $ , $ a=2 $ , $ b=-5 $ .Help Vasya to determine the number of the entrance, near which he will be at the end of his walk.",
