Arya have to find the value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF687B/74cc0e497602c391113efb814a12e06ebc180bd8.png). There are $ n $ ancient numbers $ c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n} $ and Pari has to tell Arya ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF687B/d6826eab3568be14654e0e163000c670f1c64e14.png) if Arya wants. Given $ k $ and the ancient values, tell us if Arya has a winning strategy independent of value of $ x $ or not. Formally, is it true that Arya can understand the value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF687B/74cc0e497602c391113efb814a12e06ebc180bd8.png) for any positive integer $ x $ ?\n\nNote, that ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF687B/cb1d84ad58154eb7ea26b65d1ae0039570db9bb6.png) means the remainder of $ x $ after dividing it by $ y $ .",
