    "description": "Astronaut Natasha arrived on Mars. She knows that the Martians are very poor aliens. To ensure a better life for the Mars citizens, their emperor decided to take tax from every tourist who visited the planet. Natasha is the inhabitant of Earth, therefore she had to pay the tax to enter the territory of Mars.\n\nThere are $ n $ banknote denominations on Mars: the value of $ i $ -th banknote is $ a_i $ . Natasha has an infinite number of banknotes of each denomination.\n\nMartians have $ k $ fingers on their hands, so they use a number system with base $ k $ . In addition, the Martians consider the digit $ d $ (in the number system with base $ k $ ) divine. Thus, if the last digit in Natasha's tax amount written in the number system with the base $ k $ is $ d $ , the Martians will be happy. Unfortunately, Natasha does not know the Martians' divine digit yet.\n\nDetermine for which values $ d $ Natasha can make the Martians happy.\n\nNatasha can use only her banknotes. Martians don't give her change.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000 $ , $ 2 \\le k \\le 100\\,000 $ ) \u2014 the number of denominations of banknotes and the base of the number system on Mars.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 denominations of banknotes on Mars.\n\nAll numbers are given in decimal notation.",
    "outputFormat": "On the first line output the number of values $ d $ for which Natasha can make the Martians happy.\n\nIn the second line, output all these values in increasing order.\n\nPrint all numbers in decimal notation.",

    "hint": "Consider the first test case. It uses the octal number system.\n\nIf you take one banknote with the value of $ 12 $ , you will get $ 14_8 $ in octal system. The last digit is $ 4_8 $ .\n\nIf you take one banknote with the value of $ 12 $ and one banknote with the value of $ 20 $ , the total value will be $ 32 $ . In the octal system, it is $ 40_8 $ . The last digit is $ 0_8 $ .\n\nIf you take two banknotes with the value of $ 20 $ , the total value will be $ 40 $ , this is $ 50_8 $ in the octal system. The last digit is $ 0_8 $ .\n\nNo other digits other than $ 0_8 $ and $ 4_8 $ can be obtained. Digits $ 0_8 $ and $ 4_8 $ could also be obtained in other ways.\n\nThe second test case uses the decimal number system. The nominals of all banknotes end with zero, so Natasha can give the Martians only the amount whose decimal notation also ends with zero.",
