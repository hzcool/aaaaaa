    "description": "An army of $ n $ droids is lined up in one row. Each droid is described by $ m $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{m} $ , where $ a_{i} $ is the number of details of the $ i $ -th type in this droid's mechanism. R2-D2 wants to destroy the sequence of consecutive droids of maximum length. He has $ m $ weapons, the $ i $ -th weapon can affect all the droids in the army by destroying one detail of the $ i $ -th type (if the droid doesn't have details of this type, nothing happens to it).\n\nA droid is considered to be destroyed when all of its details are destroyed. R2-D2 can make at most $ k $ shots. How many shots from the weapon of what type should R2-D2 make to destroy the sequence of consecutive droids of maximum length?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ n,m,k $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ , $ 1<=m<=5 $ , $ 0<=k<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the number of droids, the number of detail types and the number of available shots, respectively.\n\nNext $ n $ lines follow describing the droids. Each line contains $ m $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{m} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=10^{8} $ ), where $ a_{i} $ is the number of details of the $ i $ -th type for the respective robot.",
