    "description": "You've got an $ n\u00d7m $ matrix. The matrix consists of integers. In one move, you can apply a single transformation to the matrix: choose an arbitrary element of the matrix and increase it by $ 1 $ . Each element can be increased an arbitrary number of times.\n\nYou are really curious about prime numbers. Let us remind you that a prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two distinct positive integer divisors: itself and number one. For example, numbers 2, 3, 5 are prime and numbers 1, 4, 6 are not.\n\nA matrix is prime if at least one of the two following conditions fulfills:\n\n- the matrix has a row with prime numbers only;\n- the matrix has a column with prime numbers only;\n\nYour task is to count the minimum number of moves needed to get a prime matrix from the one you've got.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n,m $ $ (1<=n,m<=500) $ \u2014 the number of rows and columns in the matrix, correspondingly.\n\nEach of the following $ n $ lines contains $ m $ integers \u2014 the initial matrix. All matrix elements are positive integers. All numbers in the initial matrix do not exceed $ 10^{5} $ .\n\nThe numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.",
    "outputFormat": "Print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of moves needed to get a prime matrix from the one you've got. If you've got a prime matrix, print 0.",

Thus, the first row will consist of prime numbers: 2, 2, 3.\n\nIn the second sample you need to increase number 8 in cell (1, 2) three times. Thus, the second column will consist of prime numbers: 11, 2.\n\nIn the third sample you don't have to do anything as the second column already consists of prime numbers: 3, 2.",
