    "description": "Radewoosh is playing a computer game. There are $ n $ levels, numbered $ 1 $ through $ n $ . Levels are divided into $ k $ regions (groups). Each region contains some positive number of consecutive levels.\n\nThe game repeats the the following process:\n\n1. If all regions are beaten then the game ends immediately. Otherwise, the system finds the first region with at least one non-beaten level. Let $ X $ denote this region.\n2. The system creates an empty bag for tokens. Each token will represent one level and there may be many tokens representing the same level.\n  - For each already beaten level $ i $ in the region $ X $ , the system adds $ t_{i} $ tokens to the bag (tokens representing the $ i $ -th level).\n  - Let $ j $ denote the first non-beaten level in the region $ X $ . The system adds $ t_{j} $ tokens to the bag.\n3. Finally, the system takes a uniformly random token from the bag and a player starts the level represented by the token. A player spends one hour and beats the level, even if he has already beaten it in the past.\n\nGiven $ n $ , $ k $ and values $ t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n} $ , your task is to split levels into regions. Each level must belong to exactly one region, and each region must contain non-empty consecutive set of levels. What is the minimum possible expected number of hours required to finish the game?",
