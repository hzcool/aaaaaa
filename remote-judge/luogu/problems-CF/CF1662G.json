    "description": "SWERC organizers want to hold a gastronomic event.\n\nThe location of the event is a building with $ n $ rooms connected by $ n-1 $ corridors (each corridor connects two rooms) so that it is possible to go from any room to any other room.\n\nIn each room you have to set up the tasting of a typical Italian dish. You can choose from $ n $ typical Italian dishes rated from $ 1 $ to $ n $ depending on how good they are ( $ n $ is the best possible rating). The $ n $ dishes have distinct ratings.\n\nYou want to assign the $ n $ dishes to the $ n $ rooms so that the number of pleasing tours is maximal. A pleasing tour is a nonempty sequence of rooms so that:\n\n- Each room in the sequence is connected to the next one in the sequence by a corridor.\n- The ratings of the dishes in the rooms (in the order given by the sequence) are increasing.\n\n If you assign the $ n $ dishes optimally, what is the maximum number of pleasing tours?",

Each $ p_i $ indicates that there is a corridor between room $ i $ and room $ p_i $ . It is guaranteed that the building has the property that it is possible to go from any room to any other room.",
