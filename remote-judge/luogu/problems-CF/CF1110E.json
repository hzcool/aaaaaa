    "description": "Grigory has $ n $ magic stones, conveniently numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The charge of the $ i $ -th stone is equal to $ c_i $ .\n\nSometimes Grigory gets bored and selects some inner stone (that is, some stone with index $ i $ , where $ 2 \\le i \\le n - 1 $ ), and after that synchronizes it with neighboring stones. After that, the chosen stone loses its own charge, but acquires the charges from neighboring stones. In other words, its charge $ c_i $ changes to $ c_i' = c_{i + 1} + c_{i - 1} - c_i $ .\n\nAndrew, Grigory's friend, also has $ n $ stones with charges $ t_i $ . Grigory is curious, whether there exists a sequence of zero or more synchronization operations, which transforms charges of Grigory's stones into charges of corresponding Andrew's stones, that is, changes $ c_i $ into $ t_i $ for all $ i $ ?",
