    "description": "Farmer John is obsessed with making Bessie exercise more!\n\nBessie is out grazing on the farm, which consists of $ n $ fields connected by $ m $ directed roads. Each road takes some time $ w_i $ to cross. She is currently at field $ 1 $ and will return to her home at field $ n $ at the end of the day.\n\nFarmer John has plans to increase the time it takes to cross certain roads. He can increase the time it takes to cross each road by a nonnegative amount, but the total increase cannot exceed $ x_i $ for the $ i $ -th plan.\n\nDetermine the maximum he can make the shortest path from $ 1 $ to $ n $ for each of the $ q $ independent plans.",

It is guaranteed that the graph does not contain self-loops or parallel edges. It is possible to have a road from $ u $ to $ v $ and a road from $ v $ to $ u $ .\n\nThe next line contains a single integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \\le q \\le 10^5 $ ), the number of plans.\n\nEach of the following $ q $ lines contains a single integer $ x_i $ , the query ( $ 0 \\le x_i \\le 10^5 $ ).",
