To encrypt a sequence, one has to choose a secret sequence ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF901E/9d7f596ac3bfcb4de56caec3ed98f54b8c38886c.png), that acts as a key.\n\nVorpal is very selective, so the key should be such a sequence $ b_{i} $ , that its cyclic shifts are linearly independent, that is, there is no non-zero set of coefficients $ x_{0},x_{1},...,x_{n-1} $ , such that ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF901E/14fc308524a42e2bfab7fa5bbb60c1743e7911b3.png) for all $ k $ at the same time.\n\nAfter that for a sequence ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF901E/5656a7a50865b0a2e60963f7abba52e4c4e82222.png) you should build the following cipher:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF901E/d8113c9899e75c215e4f30da73d960636a7306eb.png)In other words, you are to compute the quadratic deviation between each cyclic shift of $ b_{i} $ and the sequence $ a_{i} $ . The resulting sequence is the Kickass's cipher. The cipher is in development right now and Vorpal wants to decipher a sequence after it has been encrypted. You are to solve this problem for him. You are given sequences $ c_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ . You are to find all suitable sequences $ a_{i} $ .",
