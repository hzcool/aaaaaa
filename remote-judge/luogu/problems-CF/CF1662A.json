    "description": "Gianni, SWERC's chief judge, received a huge amount of high quality problems from the judges and now he has to choose a problem set for SWERC.\n\nHe received $ n $ problems and he assigned a beauty score and a difficulty to each of them. The $ i $ -th problem has beauty score equal to $ b_i $ and difficulty equal to $ d_i $ . The beauty and the difficulty are integers between $ 1 $ and $ 10 $ .\n\nIf there are no problems with a certain difficulty (the possible difficulties are $ 1,2,\\dots,10 $ ) then Gianni will ask for more problems to the judges.\n\nOtherwise, for each difficulty between $ 1 $ and $ 10 $ , he will put in the problem set one of the most beautiful problems with such difficulty (so the problem set will contain exactly $ 10 $ problems with distinct difficulties). You shall compute the total beauty of the problem set, that is the sum of the beauty scores of the problems chosen by Gianni.",
