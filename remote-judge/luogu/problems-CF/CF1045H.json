    "description": "Being bored of exploring the Moon over and over again Wall-B decided to explore something he is made of \u2014 binary numbers. He took a binary number and decided to count how many times different substrings of length two appeared. He stored those values in $ c_{00} $ , $ c_{01} $ , $ c_{10} $ and $ c_{11} $ , representing how many times substrings 00, 01, 10 and 11 appear in the number respectively. For example:\n\n $ 10111100 \\rightarrow c_{00} = 1, \\ c_{01} = 1,\\ c_{10} = 2,\\ c_{11} = 3 $\n\n $ 10000 \\rightarrow c_{00} = 3,\\ c_{01} = 0,\\ c_{10} = 1,\\ c_{11} = 0 $\n\n $ 10101001 \\rightarrow c_{00} = 1,\\ c_{01} = 3,\\ c_{10} = 3,\\ c_{11} = 0 $\n\n $ 1 \\rightarrow c_{00} = 0,\\ c_{01} = 0,\\ c_{10} = 0,\\ c_{11} = 0 $\n\nWall-B noticed that there can be multiple binary numbers satisfying the same $ c_{00} $ , $ c_{01} $ , $ c_{10} $ and $ c_{11} $ constraints. Because of that he wanted to count how many binary numbers satisfy the constraints $ c_{xy} $ given the interval $ [A, B] $ . Unfortunately, his processing power wasn't strong enough to handle large intervals he was curious about. Can you help him? Since this number can be large print it modulo $ 10^9 + 7 $ .",
