    "description": "Little Mishka enjoys programming. Since her birthday has just passed, her friends decided to present her with array of non-negative integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ of $ n $ elements!\n\nMishka loved the array and she instantly decided to determine its beauty value, but she is too little and can't process large arrays. Right because of that she invited you to visit her and asked you to process $ m $ queries.\n\nEach query is processed in the following way:\n\n1. Two integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ ) are specified \u2014 bounds of query segment.\n2. Integers, presented in array segment $ [l,r] $ (in sequence of integers $ a_{l},a_{l+1},...,a_{r} $ ) even number of times, are written down.\n3. XOR-sum of written down integers is calculated, and this value is the answer for a query. Formally, if integers written down in point 2 are $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{k} $ , then Mishka wants to know the value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF703D/7210428d91e1c7505cfe57a2df3abdc28a7ac76c.png), where ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF703D/4298d47c0191af3c0a3103f431751061bc7e2362.png) \u2014 operator of exclusive bitwise OR.\n\nSince only the little bears know the definition of array beauty, all you are to do is to answer each of queries presented.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000000 $ ) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 array elements.\n\nThe third line of the input contains single integer $ m $ ( $ 1<=m<=1000000 $ ) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nEach of the next $ m $ lines describes corresponding query by a pair of integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ ) \u2014 the bounds of query segment.",
