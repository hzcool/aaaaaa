    "description": "There are $ n $ people, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , sitting at a round table. Person $ i+1 $ is sitting to the right of person $ i $ (with person $ 1 $ sitting to the right of person $ n $ ).\n\nYou have come up with a better seating arrangement, which is given as a permutation $ p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n $ . More specifically, you want to change the seats of the people so that at the end person $ p_{i+1} $ is sitting to the right of person $ p_i $ (with person $ p_1 $ sitting to the right of person $ p_n $ ). Notice that for each seating arrangement there are $ n $ permutations that describe it (which can be obtained by rotations).\n\nIn order to achieve that, you can swap two people sitting at adjacent places; but there is a catch: for all $ 1 \\le x \\le n-1 $ you cannot swap person $ x $ and person $ x+1 $ (notice that you can swap person $ n $ and person $ 1 $ ). What is the minimum number of swaps necessary? It can be proven that any arrangement can be achieved.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1\\le t\\le 10\\,000 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The descriptions of the $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 3 \\le n \\le 200\\,000 $ ) \u2014 the number of people sitting at the table.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ distinct integers $ p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n $ ( $ 1 \\le p_i \\le n $ , $ p_i \\ne p_j $ for $ i \\ne j $ ) \u2014 the desired final order of the people around the table.\n\nThe sum of the values of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 200\\,000 $ .",

    "hint": "In the first test case, we can swap person $ 4 $ and person $ 1 $ (who are adjacent) in the initial configuration and get the order $ [4, 2, 3, 1] $ which is equivalent to the desired one. Hence in this case a single swap is sufficient."
