    "description": "Xenia the mathematician has a sequence consisting of $ n $ ( $ n $ is divisible by 3) positive integers, each of them is at most 7. She wants to split the sequence into groups of three so that for each group of three $ a,b,c $ the following conditions held:\n\n- $ a&lt;b&lt;c $ ;\n- $ a $ divides $ b $ , $ b $ divides $ c $ .\n\nNaturally, Xenia wants each element of the sequence to belong to exactly one group of three. Thus, if the required partition exists, then it has ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF342A/cf2733ea0aacbe28f053605e4a0603ddeb7a4835.png) groups of three.\n\nHelp Xenia, find the required partition or else say that it doesn't exist.",
