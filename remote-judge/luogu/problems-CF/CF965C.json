    "description": " $ k $ people want to split $ n $ candies between them. Each candy should be given to exactly one of them or be thrown away.\n\nThe people are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ k $ , and Arkady is the first of them. To split the candies, Arkady will choose an integer $ x $ and then give the first $ x $ candies to himself, the next $ x $ candies to the second person, the next $ x $ candies to the third person and so on in a cycle. The leftover (the remainder that is not divisible by $ x $ ) will be thrown away.\n\nArkady can't choose $ x $ greater than $ M $ as it is considered greedy. Also, he can't choose such a small $ x $ that some person will receive candies more than $ D $ times, as it is considered a slow splitting.\n\nPlease find what is the maximum number of candies Arkady can receive by choosing some valid $ x $ .",

    "hint": "In the first example Arkady should choose $ x = 4 $ . He will give $ 4 $ candies to himself, $ 4 $ candies to the second person, $ 4 $ candies to the third person, then $ 4 $ candies to the fourth person and then again $ 4 $ candies to himself. No person is given candies more than $ 2 $ times, and Arkady receives $ 8 $ candies in total.\n\nNote that if Arkady chooses $ x = 5 $ , he will receive only $ 5 $ candies, and if he chooses $ x = 3 $ , he will receive only $ 3 + 3 = 6 $ candies as well as the second person, the third and the fourth persons will receive $ 3 $ candies, and $ 2 $ candies will be thrown away. He can't choose $ x = 1 $ nor $ x = 2 $ because in these cases he will receive candies more than $ 2 $ times.\n\nIn the second example Arkady has to choose $ x = 4 $ , because any smaller value leads to him receiving candies more than $ 1 $ time.",
