    "description": "In the snake exhibition, there are $ n $ rooms (numbered $ 0 $ to $ n - 1 $ ) arranged in a circle, with a snake in each room. The rooms are connected by $ n $ conveyor belts, and the $ i $ -th conveyor belt connects the rooms $ i $ and $ (i+1) \\bmod n $ . In the other words, rooms $ 0 $ and $ 1 $ , $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ , $ \\ldots $ , $ n-2 $ and $ n-1 $ , $ n-1 $ and $ 0 $ are connected with conveyor belts.\n\nThe $ i $ -th conveyor belt is in one of three states:\n\n- If it is clockwise, snakes can only go from room $ i $ to $ (i+1) \\bmod n $ .\n- If it is anticlockwise, snakes can only go from room $ (i+1) \\bmod n $ to $ i $ .\n- If it is off, snakes can travel in either direction.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1428B/76fac914463a158de3ff2f71ea695b0a2d793a84.png)Above is an example with $ 4 $ rooms, where belts $ 0 $ and $ 3 $ are off, $ 1 $ is clockwise, and $ 2 $ is anticlockwise.\n\nEach snake wants to leave its room and come back to it later. A room is returnable if the snake there can leave the room, and later come back to it using the conveyor belts. How many such returnable rooms are there?",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 1000 $ ): the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n The first line of each test case description contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 300\\,000 $ ): the number of rooms.\n\n The next line of each test case description contains a string $ s $ of length $ n $ , consisting of only '&lt;', '&gt;' and '-'.\n\n- If $ s_{i} =  $ '&gt;', the $ i $ -th conveyor belt goes clockwise.\n- If $ s_{i} =  $ '&lt;', the $ i $ -th conveyor belt goes anticlockwise.\n- If $ s_{i} =  $ '-', the $ i $ -th conveyor belt is off.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ among all test cases does not exceed $ 300\\,000 $ .",

This test case corresponds to the picture from the problem statement.\n\n In the second test case, all rooms are returnable by traveling on the series of clockwise belts.",
