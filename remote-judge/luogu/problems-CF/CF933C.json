    "description": "Firecrackers scare Nian the monster, but they're wayyyyy too noisy! Maybe fireworks make a nice complement.\n\nLittle Tommy is watching a firework show. As circular shapes spread across the sky, a splendid view unfolds on the night of Lunar New Year's eve.\n\nA wonder strikes Tommy. How many regions are formed by the circles on the sky? We consider the sky as a flat plane. A region is a connected part of the plane with positive area, whose bound consists of parts of bounds of the circles and is a curve or several curves without self-intersections, and that does not contain any curve other than its boundaries. Note that exactly one of the regions extends infinitely.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=3 $ ), denoting the number of circles.\n\nThe following $ n $ lines each contains three space-separated integers $ x $ , $ y $ and $ r $ ( $ -10<=x,y<=10 $ , $ 1<=r<=10 $ ), describing a circle whose center is $ (x,y) $ and the radius is $ r $ . No two circles have the same $ x $ , $ y $ and $ r $ at the same time.",
