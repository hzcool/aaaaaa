    "description": "While swimming at the beach, Mike has accidentally dropped his cellphone into the water. There was no worry as he bought a cheap replacement phone with an old-fashioned keyboard. The keyboard has only ten digital equal-sized keys, located in the following way:\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF689A/0342f4147f163e7abcc57c3f34c170ac4ad52a2c.png)Together with his old phone, he lost all his contacts and now he can only remember the way his fingers moved when he put some number in. One can formally consider finger movements as a sequence of vectors connecting centers of keys pressed consecutively to put in a number.

In other words, is there any other number, that has the same finger movements?",
