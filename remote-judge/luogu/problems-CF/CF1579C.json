    "description": "Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size $ n \\times m $ . Initially, all cells of the field are white.\n\nLet us denote the cell with coordinates $ i $ vertically and $ j $ horizontally by $ (i, j) $ . The upper left cell will be referred to as $ (1, 1) $ and the lower right cell as $ (n, m) $ .\n\nCasimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size $ d $ ( $ d > 0 $ ) with its center in cell $ (i, j) $ is drawn as follows:\n\n1. First, the center cell $ (i, j) $ is painted black.\n2. Then exactly $ d $ cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly $ d $ cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black.\n3. That is all the cells with coordinates $ (i - h, j \\pm h) $ for all $ h $ between $ 0 $ and $ d $ are painted. In particular, a tick consists of $ 2d + 1 $ black cells.\n\nAn already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the $ 4 \\times 9 $ box, with two ticks of sizes $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1579C/b2b898f1569af103ffaf93cfc9bbbe7d51da03c3.png)You are given a description of a checkered field of size $ n \\times m $ . Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly $ 0 $ ) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least $ k $ (that is, $ d \\ge k $ for all the ticks).\n\nDetermine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes $ d \\ge k $ or not.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 100 $ ) \u2014 the number test cases.\n\nThe following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of the test case description contains the integers $ n $ , $ m $ , and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le k \\le n \\le 10 $ ; $ 1 \\le m \\le 19 $ ) \u2014 the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew.
