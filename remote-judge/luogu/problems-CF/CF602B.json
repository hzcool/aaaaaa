    "description": "When Xellos was doing a practice course in university, he once had to measure the intensity of an effect that slowly approached equilibrium. A good way to determine the equilibrium intensity would be choosing a sufficiently large number of consecutive data points that seems as constant as possible and taking their average. Of course, with the usual sizes of data, it's nothing challenging \u2014 but why not make a similar programming contest problem while we're at it?\n\nYou're given a sequence of $ n $ data points $ a_{1},...,a_{n} $ . There aren't any big jumps between consecutive data points \u2014 for each $ 1<=i&lt;n $ , it's guaranteed that $ |a_{i+1}-a_{i}|<=1 $ .\n\nA range $ [l,r] $ of data points is said to be almost constant if the difference between the largest and the smallest value in that range is at most $ 1 $ . Formally, let $ M $ be the maximum and $ m $ the minimum value of $ a_{i} $ for $ l<=i<=r $ ; the range $ [l,r] $ is almost constant if $ M-m<=1 $ .\n\nFind the length of the longest almost constant range.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=100000 $ ) \u2014 the number of data points.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=100000 $ ).",
