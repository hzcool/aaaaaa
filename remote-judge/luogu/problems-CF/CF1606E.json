    "description": "There are $ n $ heroes fighting in the arena. Initially, the $ i $ -th hero has $ a_i $ health points.\n\nThe fight in the arena takes place in several rounds. At the beginning of each round, each alive hero deals $ 1 $ damage to all other heroes. Hits of all heroes occur simultaneously. Heroes whose health is less than $ 1 $ at the end of the round are considered killed.\n\nIf exactly $ 1 $ hero remains alive after a certain round, then he is declared the winner. Otherwise, there is no winner.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of ways to choose the initial health points for each hero $ a_i $ , where $ 1 \\le a_i \\le x $ , so that there is no winner of the fight. The number of ways can be very large, so print it modulo $ 998244353 $ . Two ways are considered different if at least one hero has a different amount of health. For example, $ [1, 2, 1] $ and $ [2, 1, 1] $ are different.",
