    "description": "Monocarp is playing a strategy game. In the game, he recruits a squad to fight monsters. Before each battle, Monocarp has $ C $ coins to spend on his squad.\n\nBefore each battle starts, his squad is empty. Monocarp chooses one type of units and recruits no more units of that type than he can recruit with $ C $ coins.\n\nThere are $ n $ types of units. Every unit type has three parameters:\n\n- $ c_i $ \u2014 the cost of recruiting one unit of the $ i $ -th type;\n- $ d_i $ \u2014 the damage that one unit of the $ i $ -th type deals in a second;\n- $ h_i $ \u2014 the amount of health of one unit of the $ i $ -th type.\n\nMonocarp has to face $ m $ monsters. Every monster has two parameters:\n\n- $ D_j $ \u2014 the damage that the $ j $ -th monster deals in a second;\n- $ H_j $ \u2014 the amount of health the $ j $ -th monster has.\n\nMonocarp has to fight only the $ j $ -th monster during the $ j $ -th battle. He wants all his recruited units to stay alive. Both Monocarp's squad and the monster attack continuously (not once per second) and at the same time. Thus, Monocarp wins the battle if and only if his squad kills the monster strictly faster than the monster kills one of his units. The time is compared with no rounding.\n\nFor each monster, Monocarp wants to know the minimum amount of coins he has to spend to kill that monster. If this amount is greater than $ C $ , then report that it's impossible to kill that monster.",

    "hint": "Consider the first monster of the first example.\n\nMonocarp can't recruit one unit of the first type, because it will take both him and the monster $ 0.75 $ seconds to kill each other. He can recruit two units for the cost of $ 6 $ coins and kill the monster in $ 0.375 $ second.\n\nMonocarp can recruit one unit of the second type, because he kills the monster in $ 0.6 $ seconds, and the monster kills him in $ 0.625 $ seconds. The unit is faster. Thus, $ 5 $ coins is enough.\n\nMonocarp will need at least three units of the third type to kill the first monster, that will cost $ 30 $ coins.\n\nMonocarp will spend the least coins if he chooses the second type of units and recruits one unit of that type.",
