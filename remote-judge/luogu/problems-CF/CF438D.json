    "description": "At the children's day, the child came to Picks's house, and messed his house up. Picks was angry at him. A lot of important things were lost, in particular the favorite sequence of Picks.\n\nFortunately, Picks remembers how to repair the sequence. Initially he should create an integer array $ a[1],a[2],...,a[n] $ . Then he should perform a sequence of $ m $ operations. An operation can be one of the following:\n\n1. Print operation $ l,r $ . Picks should write down the value of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF438D/876beae330acc049f49836f16bfed34538663977.png).\n2. Modulo operation $ l,r,x $ . Picks should perform assignment $ a[i]=a[i]\u00a0mod\u00a0x $ for each $ i $ $ (l<=i<=r) $ .\n3. Set operation $ k,x $ . Picks should set the value of $ a[k] $ to $ x $ (in other words perform an assignment $ a[k]=x $ ).\n\nCan you help Picks to perform the whole sequence of operations?\n\n",
