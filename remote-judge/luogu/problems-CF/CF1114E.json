    "description": "This is an interactive problem!\n\nAn arithmetic progression or arithmetic sequence is a sequence of integers such that the subtraction of element with its previous element ( $ x_i - x_{i - 1} $ , where $ i \\ge 2 $ ) is constant \u2014 such difference is called a common difference of the sequence.\n\nThat is, an arithmetic progression is a sequence of form $ x_i = x_1 + (i - 1) d $ , where $ d $ is a common difference of the sequence.\n\nThere is a secret list of $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that all elements $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ are between $ 0 $ and $ 10^9 $ , inclusive.\n\nThis list is special: if sorted in increasing order, it will form an arithmetic progression with positive common difference ( $ d > 0 $ ). For example, the list $ [14, 24, 9, 19] $ satisfies this requirement, after sorting it makes a list $ [9, 14, 19, 24] $ , which can be produced as $ x_n = 9 + 5 \\cdot (n - 1) $ .\n\nAlso you are also given a device, which has a quite discharged battery, thus you can only use it to perform at most $ 60 $ queries of following two types:\n\n- Given a value $ i $ ( $ 1 \\le i \\le n $ ), the device will show the value of the $ a_i $ .\n- Given a value $ x $ ( $ 0 \\le x \\le 10^9 $ ), the device will return $ 1 $ if an element with a value strictly greater than $ x $ exists, and it will return $ 0 $ otherwise.\n\nYour can use this special device for at most $ 60 $ queries. Could you please find out the smallest element and the common difference of the sequence? That is, values $ x_1 $ and $ d $ in the definition of the arithmetic progression. Note that the array $ a $ is not sorted.",

    "outputFormat": "The interaction starts with a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 10^6 $ ), the size of the list of integers.\n\nThen you can make queries of two types:\n\n- \"? i\" ( $ 1 \\le i \\le n $ ) \u2014 to get the value of $ a_i $ .\n- \"> x\" ( $ 0 \\le x \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 to check whether there exists an element greater than $ x $\n\nAfter the query read its result $ r $ as an integer.\n\n- For the first query type, the $ r $ satisfies $ 0 \\le r \\le 10^9 $ .\n- For the second query type, the $ r $ is either $ 0 $ or $ 1 $ .\n- In case you make more than $ 60 $ queries or violated the number range in the queries, you will get a $ r = -1 $ .\n- If you terminate after receiving the -1, you will get the \"Wrong answer\" verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nWhen you find out what the smallest element $ x_1 $ and common difference $ d $ , print\n\n- \"! $ x_1 $ $ d $ \"\n\nAnd quit after that. This query is not counted towards the $ 60 $ queries limit.\n\nAfter printing any query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nFor hack, use the following format:\n\nThe first line should contain an integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 10^6 $ ) \u2014 the list's size.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the elements of the list.\n\nAlso, after the sorting the list must form an arithmetic progression with positive common difference.",
