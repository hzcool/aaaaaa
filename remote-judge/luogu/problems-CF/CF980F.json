    "description": "You are given a special connected undirected graph where each vertex belongs to at most one simple cycle.\n\nYour task is to remove as many edges as needed to convert this graph into a tree (connected graph with no cycles).\n\nFor each node, independently, output the maximum distance between it and a leaf in the resulting tree, assuming you were to remove the edges in a way that minimizes this distance.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 5\\cdot 10^5 $ ), the number of nodes and the number of edges, respectively.\n\nEach of the following $ m $ lines contains two integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1 \\leq u,v \\leq n $ , $ u \\ne v $ ), and represents an edge connecting the two nodes $ u $ and $ v $ . Each pair of nodes is connected by at most one edge.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph is connected and each vertex belongs to at most one simple cycle.",
