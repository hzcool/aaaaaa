    "description": "Mole is hungry again. He found one ant colony, consisting of $ n $ ants, ordered in a row. Each ant $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) has a strength $ s_{i} $ .\n\nIn order to make his dinner more interesting, Mole organizes a version of \u00abHunger Games\u00bb for the ants. He chooses two numbers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ ) and each pair of ants with indices between $ l $ and $ r $ (inclusively) will fight. When two ants $ i $ and $ j $ fight, ant $ i $ gets one battle point only if $ s_{i} $ divides $ s_{j} $ (also, ant $ j $ gets one battle point only if $ s_{j} $ divides $ s_{i} $ ).\n\nAfter all fights have been finished, Mole makes the ranking. An ant $ i $ , with $ v_{i} $ battle points obtained, is going to be freed only if $ v_{i}=r-l $ , or in other words only if it took a point in every fight it participated. After that, Mole eats the rest of the ants. Note that there can be many ants freed or even none.\n\nIn order to choose the best sequence, Mole gives you $ t $ segments $ [l_{i},r_{i}] $ and asks for each of them how many ants is he going to eat if those ants fight.",
