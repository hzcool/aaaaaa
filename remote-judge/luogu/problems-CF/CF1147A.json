    "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game on a line with $ n $ cells. There are $ n $ cells labeled from $ 1 $ through $ n $ . For each $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n-1 $ , cells $ i $ and $ i+1 $ are adjacent.\n\nAlice initially has a token on some cell on the line, and Bob tries to guess where it is.\n\nBob guesses a sequence of line cell numbers $ x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k $ in order. In the $ i $ -th question, Bob asks Alice if her token is currently on cell $ x_i $ . That is, Alice can answer either \"YES\" or \"NO\" to each Bob's question.\n\nAt most one time in this process, before or after answering a question, Alice is allowed to move her token from her current cell to some adjacent cell. Alice acted in such a way that she was able to answer \"NO\" to all of Bob's questions.\n\nNote that Alice can even move her token before answering the first question or after answering the last question. Alice can also choose to not move at all.\n\nYou are given $ n $ and Bob's questions $ x_1, \\ldots, x_k $ . You would like to count the number of scenarios that let Alice answer \"NO\" to all of Bob's questions.\n\nLet $ (a,b) $ denote a scenario where Alice starts at cell $ a $ and ends at cell $ b $ . Two scenarios $ (a_i, b_i) $ and $ (a_j, b_j) $ are different if $ a_i \\neq a_j $ or $ b_i \\neq b_j $ .",

    "hint": "The notation $ (i,j) $ denotes a scenario where Alice starts at cell $ i $ and ends at cell $ j $ .\n\nIn the first example, the valid scenarios are $ (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5) $ . For example, $ (3,4) $ is valid since Alice can start at cell $ 3 $ , stay there for the first three questions, then move to cell $ 4 $ after the last question.\n\n $ (4,5) $ is valid since Alice can start at cell $ 4 $ , stay there for the first question, the move to cell $ 5 $ for the next two questions. Note that $ (4,5) $ is only counted once, even though there are different questions that Alice can choose to do the move, but remember, we only count each pair of starting and ending positions once.\n\nIn the second example, Alice has no valid scenarios.\n\nIn the last example, all $ (i,j) $ where $ |i-j| \\leq 1 $ except for $ (42, 42) $ are valid scenarios.",
