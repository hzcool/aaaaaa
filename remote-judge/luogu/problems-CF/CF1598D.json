    "description": "Monocarp is the coach of the Berland State University programming teams. He decided to compose a problemset for a training session for his teams.\n\nMonocarp has $ n $ problems that none of his students have seen yet. The $ i $ -th problem has a topic $ a_i $ (an integer from $ 1 $ to $ n $ ) and a difficulty $ b_i $ (an integer from $ 1 $ to $ n $ ). All problems are different, that is, there are no two tasks that have the same topic and difficulty at the same time.\n\nMonocarp decided to select exactly $ 3 $ problems from $ n $ problems for the problemset. The problems should satisfy at least one of two conditions (possibly, both):\n\n- the topics of all three selected problems are different;\n- the difficulties of all three selected problems are different.\n\nYour task is to determine the number of ways to select three problems for the problemset.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 50000 $ ) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of problems that Monocarp have.\n\nIn the $ i $ -th of the following $ n $ lines, there are two integers $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le n $ ) \u2014 the topic and the difficulty of the $ i $ -th problem.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there are no two problems that have the same topic and difficulty at the same time.\n\nThe sum of $ n $ over all testcases doesn't exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
