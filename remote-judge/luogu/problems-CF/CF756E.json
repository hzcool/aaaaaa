    "description": "There are $ n $ types of coins in Byteland. Conveniently, the denomination of the coin type $ k $ divides the denomination of the coin type $ k+1 $ , the denomination of the coin type $ 1 $ equals $ 1 $ tugrick. The ratio of the denominations of coin types $ k+1 $ and $ k $ equals $ a_{k} $ . It is known that for each $ x $ there are at most 20 coin types of denomination $ x $ .\n\nByteasar has $ b_{k} $ coins of type $ k $ with him, and he needs to pay exactly $ m $ tugricks. It is known that Byteasar never has more than $ 3\u00b710^{5} $ coins with him. Byteasar want to know how many ways there are to pay exactly $ m $ tugricks. Two ways are different if there is an integer $ k $ such that the amount of coins of type $ k $ differs in these two ways. As all Byteland citizens, Byteasar wants to know the number of ways modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .",
