    "description": "Igor is in 11th grade. Tomorrow he will have to write an informatics test by the strictest teacher in the school, Pavel Denisovich.\n\nIgor knows how the test will be conducted: first of all, the teacher will give each student two positive integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ a < b $ ). After that, the student can apply any of the following operations any number of times:\n\n- $ a := a + 1 $ (increase $ a $ by $ 1 $ ),\n- $ b := b + 1 $ (increase $ b $ by $ 1 $ ),\n- $ a := a \\ | \\ b $ (replace $ a $ with the [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR) of $ a $ and $ b $ ).\n\nTo get full marks on the test, the student has to tell the teacher the minimum required number of operations to make $ a $ and $ b $ equal.\n\nIgor already knows which numbers the teacher will give him. Help him figure out what is the minimum number of operations needed to make $ a $ equal to $ b $ .",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line for each test case contains two integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1 \\le a < b \\le 10^6 $ ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ b $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 10^6 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case print one integer \u2014 the minimum required number of operations to make $ a $ and $ b $ equal.",
