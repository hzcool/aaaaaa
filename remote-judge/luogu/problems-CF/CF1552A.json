    "description": "A string $ s $ of length $ n $ , consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet, is given.\n\nYou must choose some number $ k $ between $ 0 $ and $ n $ . Then, you select $ k $ characters of $ s $ and permute them however you want. In this process, the positions of the other $ n-k $ characters remain unchanged. You have to perform this operation exactly once.\n\nFor example, if $ s=\\texttt{\"andrea\"} $ , you can choose the $ k=4 $ characters $ \\texttt{\"a_d_ea\"} $ and permute them into $ \\texttt{\"d_e_aa\"} $ so that after the operation the string becomes $ \\texttt{\"dneraa\"} $ .\n\nDetermine the minimum $ k $ so that it is possible to sort $ s $ alphabetically (that is, after the operation its characters appear in alphabetical order).",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 40 $ ) \u2014 the length of the string.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string $ s $ . It is guaranteed that $ s $ contains only lowercase letters of the English alphabet.",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum $ k $ that allows you to obtain a string sorted alphabetically, through the operation described above.",

    "hint": "In the first test case, we can choose the $ k=2 $ characters $ \\texttt{\"_ol\"} $ and rearrange them as $ \\texttt{\"_lo\"} $ (so the resulting string is $ \\texttt{\"llo\"} $ ). It is not possible to sort the string choosing strictly less than $ 2 $ characters.\n\nIn the second test case, one possible way to sort $ s $ is to consider the $ k=6 $ characters $ \\texttt{\"_o__force_\"} $ and rearrange them as $ \\texttt{\"_c__efoor_\"} $ (so the resulting string is $ \\texttt{\"ccdeefoors\"} $ ). One can show that it is not possible to sort the string choosing strictly less than $ 6 $ characters.\n\nIn the third test case, string $ s $ is already sorted (so we can choose $ k=0 $ characters).\n\nIn the fourth test case, we can choose all $ k=4 $ characters $ \\texttt{\"dcba\"} $ and reverse the whole string (so the resulting string is $ \\texttt{\"abcd\"} $ ).",
