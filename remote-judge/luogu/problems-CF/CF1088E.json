    "description": "You're given a tree consisting of $ n $ nodes. Every node $ u $ has a weight $ a_u $ . You want to choose an integer $ k $ $ (1 \\le k \\le n) $ and then choose $ k $ connected components of nodes that don't overlap (i.e every node is in at most 1 component). Let the set of nodes you chose be $ s $ . You want to maximize:\n\n $ $$$\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{u \\in s} a_u}{k} $ $ </p><p>In other words, you want to maximize the sum of weights of nodes in  $ s $  divided by the number of connected components you chose. Also, if there are several solutions, you want to <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">maximize  $ k$$$.\n\nNote that adjacent nodes can belong to different components. Refer to the third sample.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains the integer $ n $ $ (1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5) $ , the number of nodes in the tree.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_1 $ , $ a_2 $ , $ \\dots $ , $ a_n $ $ (|a_i| \\le 10^9) $ , the weights of the nodes.\n\nThe next $ n-1 $ lines, each contains 2 space-separated integers $ u $ and $ v $ $ (1 \\le u,v \\le n) $ which means there's an edge between $ u $ and $ v $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Print the answer as a non-reduced fraction represented by 2 space-separated integers. The fraction itself should be maximized and if there are several possible ways, you should maximize the denominator. See the samples for a better understanding.",
