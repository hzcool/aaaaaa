    "description": "In the Isle of Guernsey there are $ n $ different types of coins. For each $ i $ $ (1<=i<=n) $ , coin of type $ i $ is worth $ a_{i} $ cents. It is possible that $ a_{i}=a_{j} $ for some $ i $ and $ j $ $ (i\u2260j) $ .\n\nBessie has some set of these coins totaling $ t $ cents. She tells Jessie $ q $ pairs of integers. For each $ i $ $ (1<=i<=q) $ , the pair $ b_{i},c_{i} $ tells Jessie that Bessie has a strictly greater number of coins of type $ b_{i} $ than coins of type $ c_{i} $ . It is known that all $ b_{i} $ are distinct and all $ c_{i} $ are distinct.\n\nHelp Jessie find the number of possible combinations of coins Bessie could have. Two combinations are considered different if there is some $ i $ $ (1<=i<=n) $ , such that the number of coins Bessie has of type $ i $ is different in the two combinations. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .\n\nIf there are no possible combinations of coins totaling $ t $ cents that satisfy Bessie's conditions, output 0.",
