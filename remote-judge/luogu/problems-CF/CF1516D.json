    "description": "This time Baby Ehab will only cut and not stick. He starts with a piece of paper with an array $ a $ of length $ n $ written on it, and then he does the following:\n\n- he picks a range $ (l, r) $ and cuts the subsegment $ a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_r $ out, removing the rest of the array.\n- he then cuts this range into multiple subranges.\n- to add a number theory spice to it, he requires that the elements of every subrange must have their product equal to their [least common multiple (LCM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple).\n\nFormally, he partitions the elements of $ a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_r $ into contiguous subarrays such that the product of every subarray is equal to its LCM. Now, for $ q $ independent ranges $ (l, r) $ , tell Baby Ehab the minimum number of subarrays he needs.",

The second has product and LCM equal to $ 210 $ . And the third has product and LCM equal to $ 70 $ . Another possible partitioning is $ [2,3] $ , $ [10,7] $ , and $ [5,14] $ .\n\nThe second query asks about the range $ (2,4) $ . Its product is equal to its LCM, so you don't need to partition it further.\n\nThe last query asks about the range $ (3,5) $ . You can partition it into $ [10,7] $ and $ [5] $ .",
