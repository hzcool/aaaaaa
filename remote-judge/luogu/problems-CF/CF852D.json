    "description": "The competitors of Bubble Cup X gathered after the competition and discussed what is the best way to get to know the host country and its cities.\n\nAfter exploring the map of Serbia for a while, the competitors came up with the following facts: the country has $ V $ cities which are indexed with numbers from $ 1 $ to $ V $ , and there are $ E $ bi-directional roads that connect the cites. Each road has a weight (the time needed to cross that road). There are $ N $ teams at the Bubble Cup and the competitors came up with the following plan: each of the $ N $ teams will start their journey in one of the $ V $ cities, and some of the teams share the starting position.\n\nThey want to find the shortest time $ T $ , such that every team can move in these $ T $ minutes, and the number of different cities they end up in is at least $ K $ (because they will only get to know the cities they end up in). A team doesn't have to be on the move all the time, if they like it in a particular city, they can stay there and wait for the time to pass.\n\nPlease help the competitors to determine the shortest time $ T $ so it's possible for them to end up in at least $ K $ different cities or print -1 if that is impossible no matter how they move.\n\nNote that there can exist multiple roads between some cities.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains four integers: $ V $ , $ E $ , $ N $ and $ K\\ (1<=V<=600,\\ 1<=E<=20000,\\ 1<=N<=min(V,200),\\ 1<=K<=N) $ , number of cities, number of roads, number of teams and the smallest number of different cities they need to end up in, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $ N $ integers, the cities where the teams start their journey.\n\nNext $ E $ lines contain information about the roads in following format: $ A_{i}\\ B_{i}\\ T_{i}\\ (1<=A_{i},B_{i}<=V,\\ 1<=T_{i}<=10000) $ , which means that there is a road connecting cities $ A_{i} $ and $ B_{i} $ , and you need $ T_{i} $ minutes to cross that road.",
    "outputFormat": "Output a single integer that represents the minimal time the teams can move for, such that they end up in at least $ K $ different cities or output -1 if there is no solution.\n\nIf the solution exists, result will be no greater than $ 1731311 $ .",

If they agree to move for 3 minutes, one possible situation would be the following: Two teams in city 2, one team in city 5, one team in city 3 , and one team in city 1. And we see that there are four different cities the teams end their journey at.",
