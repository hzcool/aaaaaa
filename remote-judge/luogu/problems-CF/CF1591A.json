    "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given $ n $ days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows:\n\n- If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies.\n- If the flower is watered in the $ i $ -th day, it grows by $ 1 $ centimeter.\n- If the flower is watered in the $ i $ -th and in the $ (i-1) $ -th day ( $ i > 1 $ ), then it grows by $ 5 $ centimeters instead of $ 1 $ .\n- If the flower is not watered in the $ i $ -th day, it does not grow.\n\nAt the beginning of the $ 1 $ -st day the flower is $ 1 $ centimeter tall. What is its height after $ n $ days?",
