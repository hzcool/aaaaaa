    "description": "The Queen of England has $ n $ trees growing in a row in her garden. At that, the $ i $ -th $ (1<=i<=n) $ tree from the left has height $ a_{i} $ meters. Today the Queen decided to update the scenery of her garden. She wants the trees' heights to meet the condition: for all $ i $ $ (1<=i&lt;n) $ , $ a_{i+1}-a_{i}=k $ , where $ k $ is the number the Queen chose.\n\nUnfortunately, the royal gardener is not a machine and he cannot fulfill the desire of the Queen instantly! In one minute, the gardener can either decrease the height of a tree to any positive integer height or increase the height of a tree to any positive integer height. How should the royal gardener act to fulfill a whim of Her Majesty in the minimum number of minutes?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two space-separated integers: $ n $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,k<=1000) $ . The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=1000 $ ) \u2014 the heights of the trees in the row.",
    "outputFormat": "In the first line print a single integer $ p $ \u2014 the minimum number of minutes the gardener needs. In the next $ p $ lines print the description of his actions.\n\nIf the gardener needs to increase the height of the $ j $ -th ( $ 1<=j<=n $ ) tree from the left by $ x $ $ (x>=1) $ meters, then print in the corresponding line \"+ j x\". If the gardener needs to decrease the height of the $ j $ -th ( $ 1<=j<=n $ ) tree from the left by $ x $ $ (x>=1) $ meters, print on the corresponding line \"- j x\".\n\nIf there are multiple ways to make a row of trees beautiful in the minimum number of actions, you are allowed to print any of them.",
