    "description": "Carol is currently curling.\n\nShe has $ n $ disks each with radius $ r $ on the 2D plane.\n\nInitially she has all these disks above the line $ y=10^{100} $ .\n\nShe then will slide the disks towards the line $ y=0 $ one by one in order from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .\n\nWhen she slides the $ i $ -th disk, she will place its center at the point $ (x_{i},10^{100}) $ . She will then push it so the disk\u2019s $ y $ coordinate continuously decreases, and $ x $ coordinate stays constant. The disk stops once it touches the line $ y=0 $ or it touches any previous disk. Note that once a disk stops moving, it will not move again, even if hit by another disk.\n\nCompute the $ y $ -coordinates of centers of all the disks after all disks have been pushed.",
