    "description": "Polycarpus loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers, whose decimal representation (without leading zeroes) contain only the lucky digits $ x $ and $ y $ . For example, if $ x=4 $ , and $ y=7 $ , then numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky.\n\nLet's call a positive integer $ a $ undoubtedly lucky, if there are such digits $ x $ and $ y $ $ (0<=x,y<=9) $ , that the decimal representation of number $ a $ (without leading zeroes) contains only digits $ x $ and $ y $ .\n\nPolycarpus has integer $ n $ . He wants to know how many positive integers that do not exceed $ n $ , are undoubtedly lucky. Help him, count this number.",
