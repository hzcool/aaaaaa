Networking, meeting new people, and using friends' connections are essential to stay up to date with the latest news from the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe conference has $ n $ participants, who are initially unfamiliar with each other. William can introduce any two people, $ a $ and $ b $ , who were not familiar before, to each other.\n\nWilliam has $ d $ conditions, $ i $ 'th of which requires person $ x_i $ to have a connection to person $ y_i $ . Formally, two people $ x $ and $ y $ have a connection if there is such a chain $ p_1=x, p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_k=y $ for which for all $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ k - 1 $ it's true that two people with numbers $ p_i $ and $ p_{i + 1} $ know each other.\n\nFor every $ i $ ( $ 1 \\le i \\le d $ ) William wants you to calculate the maximal number of acquaintances one person can have, assuming that William satisfied all conditions from $ 1 $ and up to and including $ i $ and performed exactly $ i $ introductions. The conditions are being checked after William performed $ i $ introductions. The answer for each $ i $ must be calculated independently. It means that when you compute an answer for $ i $ , you should assume that no two people have been introduced to each other yet.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ d $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 10^3, 1 \\le d \\le n - 1 $ ), the number of people, and number of conditions, respectively.\n\nEach of the next $ d $ lines each contain two integers $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ ( $ 1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n, x_i \\neq y_i $ ), the numbers of people which must have a connection according to condition $ i $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Output $ d $ integers. $ i $ th number must equal the number of acquaintances the person with the maximal possible acquaintances will have, if William performed $ i $ introductions and satisfied the first $ i $ conditions.",
