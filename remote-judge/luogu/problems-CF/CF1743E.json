    "description": "Monocarp is playing a video game. In the game, he controls a spaceship and has to destroy an enemy spaceship.\n\nMonocarp has two lasers installed on his spaceship. Both lasers $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ have two values:\n\n- $ p_i $ \u2014 the power of the laser;\n- $ t_i $ \u2014 the reload time of the laser.\n\nWhen a laser is fully charged, Monocarp can either shoot it or wait for the other laser to charge and shoot both of them at the same time.\n\nAn enemy spaceship has $ h $ durability and $ s $ shield capacity. When Monocarp shoots an enemy spaceship, it receives $ (P - s) $ damage (i. e. $ (P - s) $ gets subtracted from its durability), where $ P $ is the total power of the lasers that Monocarp shoots (i. e. $ p_i $ if he only shoots laser $ i $ and $ p_1 + p_2 $ if he shoots both lasers at the same time). An enemy spaceship is considered destroyed when its durability becomes $ 0 $ or lower.\n\nInitially, both lasers are zero charged.\n\nWhat's the lowest amount of time it can take Monocarp to destroy an enemy spaceship?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ p_1 $ and $ t_1 $ ( $ 2 \\le p_1 \\le 5000 $ ; $ 1 \\le t_1 \\le 10^{12} $ ) \u2014 the power and the reload time of the first laser.\n\nThe second line contains two integers $ p_2 $ and $ t_2 $ ( $ 2 \\le p_2 \\le 5000 $ ; $ 1 \\le t_2 \\le 10^{12} $ ) \u2014 the power and the reload time of the second laser.\n\nThe third line contains two integers $ h $ and $ s $ ( $ 1 \\le h \\le 5000 $ ; $ 1 \\le s < \\min(p_1, p_2) $ ) \u2014 the durability and the shield capacity of an enemy spaceship. Note that the last constraint implies that Monocarp will always be able to destroy an enemy spaceship.",

    "hint": "In the first example, Monocarp waits for both lasers to charge, then shoots both lasers at $ 10 $ , they deal $ (5 + 4 - 1) = 8 $ damage. Then he waits again and shoots lasers at $ 20 $ , dealing $ 8 $ more damage.\n\nIn the second example, Monocarp doesn't wait for the second laser to charge. He just shoots the first laser $ 25 $ times, dealing $ (10 - 9) = 1 $ damage each time.",
