    "description": "There is a system of $ n $ vessels arranged one above the other as shown in the figure below. Assume that the vessels are numbered from 1 to $ n $ , in the order from the highest to the lowest, the volume of the $ i $ -th vessel is $ a_{i} $ liters.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF371D/f198564e53bb2ea5c99e17b823930a432879118f.png)Initially, all the vessels are empty. In some vessels water is poured. All the water that overflows from the $ i $ -th vessel goes to the $ (i+1) $ -th one. The liquid that overflows from the $ n $ -th vessel spills on the floor.\n\nYour task is to simulate pouring water into the vessels. To do this, you will need to handle two types of queries:\n\n1. Add $ x_{i} $ liters of water to the $ p_{i} $ -th vessel;\n2. Print the number of liters of water in the $ k_{i} $ -th vessel.\n\nWhen you reply to the second request you can assume that all the water poured up to this point, has already overflown between the vessels.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ n $ \u2014 the number of vessels ( $ 1<=n<=2\u00b710^{5} $ ). The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ \u2014 the vessels' capacities ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ). The vessels' capacities do not necessarily increase from the top vessels to the bottom ones (see the second sample). The third line contains integer $ m $ \u2014 the number of queries ( $ 1<=m<=2\u00b710^{5} $ ). Each of the next $ m $ lines contains the description of one query. The query of the first type is represented as \" $ 1\u00a0p_{i}\u00a0x_{i} $ \", the query of the second type is represented as \" $ 2\u00a0k_{i} $ \" ( $ 1<=p_{i}<=n $ , $ 1<=x_{i}<=10^{9} $ , $ 1<=k_{i}<=n $ ).",
