    "description": "This is an interactive problem.\n\nGiven a simple undirected graph with $ n $ vertices numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , your task is to color all the vertices such that for every color $ c $ , the following conditions hold:\n\n1. The set of vertices with color $ c $ is connected;\n2. $ s_c \\leq n_c^2 $ , where $ n_c $ is the number of vertices with color $ c $ , and $ s_c $ is the sum of degrees of vertices with color $ c $ .\n\n It can be shown that there always exists a way to color all the vertices such that the above conditions hold. Initially, you are only given the number $ n $ of vertices and the degree of each vertex.\n\nIn each query, you can choose a vertex $ u $ . As a response, you will be given the $ k $ -th edge incident to $ u $ , if this is the $ k $ -th query on vertex $ u $ .\n\nYou are allowed to make at most $ n $ queries.\n\nAn undirected graph is simple if it does not contain multiple edges or self-loops.\n\nThe degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.\n\nA set $ S $ of vertices is connected if for every two different vertices $ u, v \\in S $ , there is a path, which only passes through vertices in $ S $ , that connects $ u $ and $ v $ . That is, there is a sequence of edges $ (u_1, v_1), (u_2, v_2), \\dots, (u_k, v_k) $ with $ k \\geq 1 $ such that\n\n1. $ u_1 = u $ , $ v_k = v $ , and $ v_i = u_{i+1} $ for every $ 1 \\leq i < k $ ; and\n2. $ u_k \\in S $ and $ v_k \\in S $ for every $ 1 \\leq i \\leq k $ .\n\n Especially, a set containing only one vertex is connected.",

    "hint": "In the example, there is only one test case.\n\nIn the test case, there are $ n = 5 $ vertices with vertices $ 1, 2, 3, 4 $ of degree $ 2 $ and vertex $ 5 $ of degree $ 0 $ . It is obvious that vertex $ 5 $ is isolated, i.e., it does not connect to any other vertices.\n\nA possible interaction is shown in the sample input and output, where $ 4 $ \"?\" queries are made on vertex $ 1 $ twice and vertex $ 3 $ twice. According to the responses to these queries, we know that each of vertex $ 1 $ and vertex $ 3 $ connects to two vertices $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ .\n\nA possible solution is shown in the sample output, where vertex $ 1 $ and vertex $ 2 $ are colored by $ 1 $ , vertex $ 3 $ and vertex $ 4 $ are colored by $ 2 $ , and vertex $ 5 $ is colored by $ 3 $ . It can be seen that this solution satisfies the required conditions as follows.\n\n- For color $ c = 1 $ , vertex $ 1 $ and vertex $ 2 $ are connected. Moreover, $ n_1 = 2 $ and $ s_1 = d_1 + d_2 = 2 + 2 = 4 \\leq n_1^2 = 2^2 = 4 $ ;\n- For color $ c = 2 $ , vertex $ 3 $ and vertex $ 4 $ are connected.
