    "description": "Let's assume that we are given a matrix $ b $ of size $ x\u00d7y $ , let's determine the operation of mirroring matrix $ b $ . The mirroring of matrix $ b $ is a $ 2x\u00d7y $ matrix $ c $ which has the following properties:\n\n- the upper half of matrix $ c $ (rows with numbers from $ 1 $ to $ x $ ) exactly matches $ b $ ;\n- the lower half of matrix $ c $ (rows with numbers from $ x+1 $ to $ 2x $ ) is symmetric to the upper one; the symmetry line is the line that separates two halves (the line that goes in the middle, between rows $ x $ and $ x+1 $ ).\n\nSereja has an $ n\u00d7m $ matrix $ a $ . He wants to find such matrix $ b $ , that it can be transformed into matrix $ a $ , if we'll perform on it several (possibly zero) mirrorings. What minimum number of rows can such matrix contain?",
