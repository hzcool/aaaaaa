    "description": "Two players, Red and Blue, are at it again, and this time they're playing with crayons! The mischievous duo is now vandalizing a rooted tree, by coloring the nodes while playing their favorite game.\n\nThe game works as follows: there is a tree of size $ n $ , rooted at node $ 1 $ , where each node is initially white. Red and Blue get one turn each. Red goes first.\n\nIn Red's turn, he can do the following operation any number of times:\n\n- Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree red.\n\n However, to make the game fair, Red is only allowed to color $ k $ nodes of the tree. In other words, after Red's turn, at most $ k $ of the nodes can be colored red.Then, it's Blue's turn. Blue can do the following operation any number of times:\n\n- Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree blue. However, he's not allowed to choose a subtree that contains a node already colored red, as that would make the node purple and no one likes purple crayon.\n\n Note: there's no restriction on the number of nodes Blue can color, as long as he doesn't color a node that Red has already colored.After the two turns, the score of the game is determined as follows: let $ w $ be the number of white nodes, $ r $ be the number of red nodes, and $ b $ be the number of blue nodes. The score of the game is $ w \\cdot (r - b) $ .\n\nRed wants to maximize this score, and Blue wants to minimize it. If both players play optimally, what will the final score of the game be?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ; $ 1 \\le k \\le n $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree and the maximum number of red nodes.\n\nNext $ n - 1 $ lines contains description of edges. The $ i $ -th line contains two space separated integers $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ ( $ 1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n $ ; $ u_i \\neq v_i $ ) \u2014 the $ i $ -th edge of the tree.\n\nIt's guaranteed that given edges form a tree.",

The score of the game is $ 1 \\cdot (2 - 1) = 1 $ .In the second test case, the optimal strategy is as follows:\n\n- Red chooses to color the subtree of node $ 4 $ . This colors both nodes $ 4 $ and $ 5 $ .\n- Blue does not have any options, so nothing is colored blue.\n\n At the end of this process, nodes $ 4 $ and $ 5 $ are red, and nodes $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ are white.
