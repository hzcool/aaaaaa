    "description": "And where the are the phone numbers?\n\nYou are given a string $ s $ consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer $ k $ . Find the lexicographically smallest string $ t $ of length $ k $ , such that its set of letters is a subset of the set of letters of $ s $ and $ s $ is lexicographically smaller than $ t $ .\n\nIt's guaranteed that the answer exists.\n\nNote that the set of letters is a set, not a multiset. For example, the set of letters of abadaba is $ {a,b,d} $ .\n\nString $ p $ is lexicographically smaller than string $ q $ , if $ p $ is a prefix of $ q $ , is not equal to $ q $ or there exists $ i $ , such that $ p_{i}<q_{i} $ and for all $ j<i $ it is satisfied that $ p_{j}=q_{j} $ . For example, abc is lexicographically smaller than abcd , abd is lexicographically smaller than abec, afa is not lexicographically smaller than ab and a is not lexicographically smaller than a.",
