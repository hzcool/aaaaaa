    "description": "Koa the Koala and her best friend want to play a game.\n\nThe game starts with an array $ a $ of length $ n $ consisting of non-negative integers. Koa and her best friend move in turns and each have initially a score equal to $ 0 $ . Koa starts.\n\nLet's describe a move in the game:\n\n- During his move, a player chooses any element of the array and removes it from this array, xor-ing it with the current score of the player.  More formally: if the current score of the player is $ x $ and the chosen element is $ y $ , his new score will be $ x           \\oplus y $ . Here $ \\oplus $ denotes [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).\n  \n   Note that after a move element $ y $ is removed from $ a $ .\n- The game ends when the array is empty.\n\nAt the end of the game the winner is the player with the maximum score. If both players have the same score then it's a draw.\n\nIf both players play optimally find out whether Koa will win, lose or draw the game.",

Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the length of $ a $ .\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 elements of $ a $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
