    "description": "There are $ n $ players sitting at the card table. Each player has a favorite number. The favorite number of the $ j $ -th player is $ f_j $ .\n\nThere are $ k \\cdot n $ cards on the table. Each card contains a single integer: the $ i $ -th card contains number $ c_i $ . Also, you are given a sequence $ h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_k $ . Its meaning will be explained below.\n\nThe players have to distribute all the cards in such a way that each of them will hold exactly $ k $ cards. After all the cards are distributed, each player counts the number of cards he has that contains his favorite number. The joy level of a player equals $ h_t $ if the player holds $ t $ cards containing his favorite number. If a player gets no cards with his favorite number (i.e., $ t=0 $ ), his joy level is $ 0 $ .\n\nPrint the maximum possible total joy levels of the players after the cards are distributed. Note that the sequence $ h_1, \\dots, h_k $ is the same for all the players.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 500, 1 \\le k \\le 10 $ ) \u2014 the number of players and the number of cards each player will get.\n\nThe second line contains $ k \\cdot n $ integers $ c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_{k \\cdot n} $ ( $ 1 \\le c_i \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the numbers written on the cards.\n\nThe third line contains $ n $ integers $ f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_n $ ( $ 1 \\le f_j \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the favorite numbers of the players.\n\nThe fourth line contains $ k $ integers $ h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_k $ ( $ 1 \\le h_t \\le 10^5 $ ), where $ h_t $ is the joy level of a player if he gets exactly $ t $ cards with his favorite number written on them. It is guaranteed that the condition $ h_{t - 1} < h_t $ holds for each $ t \\in [2..k] $ .",

    "hint": "In the first example, one possible optimal card distribution is the following:\n\n- Player $ 1 $ gets cards with numbers $ [1, 3, 8] $ ;\n- Player $ 2 $ gets cards with numbers $ [2, 2, 8] $ ;\n- Player $ 3 $ gets cards with numbers $ [2, 2, 8] $ ;\n- Player $ 4 $ gets cards with numbers $ [5, 5, 5] $ .\n\nThus, the answer is $ 2 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 21 $ .\n\nIn the second example, no player can get a card with his favorite number. Thus, the answer is $ 0 $ ."
