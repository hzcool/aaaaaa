    "description": "You're given an undirected graph with $ n $ nodes and $ m $ edges. Nodes are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .\n\nThe graph is considered harmonious if and only if the following property holds:\n\n- For every triple of integers $ (l, m, r) $ such that $ 1 \\le l < m < r \\le n $ , if there exists a path going from node $ l $ to node $ r $ , then there exists a path going from node $ l $ to node $ m $ .\n\nIn other words, in a harmonious graph, if from a node $ l $ we can reach a node $ r $ through edges ( $ l < r $ ), then we should able to reach nodes $ (l+1), (l+2), \\ldots, (r-1) $ too.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of edges we need to add to make the graph harmonious?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 3 \\le n \\le 200\\ 000 $ and $ 1 \\le m \\le 200\\ 000 $ ).\n\nThe $ i $ -th of the next $ m $ lines contains two integers $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ ( $ 1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n $ , $ u_i \\neq v_i $ ), that mean that there's an edge between nodes $ u $ and $ v $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph is simple (there is no self-loop, and there is at most one edge between every pair of nodes).",

However adding the edge $ (2, 4) $ is sufficient to make it harmonious.\n\nIn the second example, the given graph is already harmonious.",
