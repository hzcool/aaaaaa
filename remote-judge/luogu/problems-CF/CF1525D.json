    "description": "There are $ n $ armchairs, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from left to right. Some armchairs are occupied by people (at most one person per armchair), others are not. The number of occupied armchairs is not greater than $ \\frac{n}{2} $ .\n\nFor some reason, you would like to tell people to move from their armchairs to some other ones. If the $ i $ -th armchair is occupied by someone and the $ j $ -th armchair is not, you can tell the person sitting in the $ i $ -th armchair to move to the $ j $ -th armchair. The time it takes a person to move from the $ i $ -th armchair to the $ j $ -th one is $ |i - j| $ minutes. You may perform this operation any number of times, but these operations must be done sequentially, i. e. you cannot tell a person to move until the person you asked to move in the last operation has finished moving to their destination armchair.\n\nYou want to achieve the following situation: every seat that was initially occupied must be free. What is the minimum time you need to do it?",
