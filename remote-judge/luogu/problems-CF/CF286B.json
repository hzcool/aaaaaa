    "description": "John Doe has found the beautiful permutation formula.\n\nLet's take permutation $ p=p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ . Let's define transformation $ f $ of this permutation:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF286B/25e74201607d55d0e22ffd7930ca53b5830fbc7a.png)where $ k $ $ (k&gt;1) $ is an integer, the transformation parameter, $ r $ is such maximum integer that $ rk<=n $ . If $ rk=n $ , then elements $ p_{rk+1},p_{rk+2} $ and so on are omitted. In other words, the described transformation of permutation $ p $ cyclically shifts to the left each consecutive block of length $ k $ and the last block with the length equal to the remainder after dividing $ n $ by $ k $ .\n\nJohn Doe thinks that permutation $ f(f(\u00a0...\u00a0f(p=[1,2,...,n],2)\u00a0...\u00a0,n-1),n) $ is beautiful. Unfortunately, he cannot quickly find the beautiful permutation he's interested in. That's why he asked you to help him.\n\nYour task is to find a beautiful permutation for the given $ n $ . For clarifications, see the notes to the third sample.",
