    "description": "The famous magician Borya Budini traveled through the country $ X $ , which consists of $ n $ cities. However, an accident happened, and he was robbed in the city number $ 1 $ . Now Budini will have a hard way home to the city number $ n $ .He's going to get there by plane. In total, there are $ m $ flights in the country, $ i $ -th flies from city $ a_i $ to city $ b_i $ and costs $ s_i $ coins. Note that the $ i $ -th flight is one-way, so it can't be used to get from city $ b_i $ to city $ a_i $ . To use it, Borya must be in the city $ a_i $ and have at least $ s_i $ coins (which he will spend on the flight).\n\nAfter the robbery, he has only $ p $ coins left, but he does not despair! Being in the city $ i $ , he can organize performances every day, each performance will bring him $ w_i $ coins.\n\nHelp the magician find out if he will be able to get home, and what is the minimum number of performances he will have to organize.",
