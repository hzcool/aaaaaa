    "description": "In Berland recently a new collection of toys went on sale. This collection consists of $ 10^{9} $ types of toys, numbered with integers from $ 1 $ to $ 10^{9} $ . A toy from the new collection of the $ i $ -th type costs $ i $ bourles.\n\nTania has managed to collect $ n $ different types of toys $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ from the new collection. Today is Tanya's birthday, and her mother decided to spend no more than $ m $ bourles on the gift to the daughter. Tanya will choose several different types of toys from the new collection as a gift. Of course, she does not want to get a type of toy which she already has.\n\nTanya wants to have as many distinct types of toys in her collection as possible as the result. The new collection is too diverse, and Tanya is too little, so she asks you to help her in this.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ ) and $ m $ ( $ 1<=m<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the number of types of toys that Tanya already has and the number of bourles that her mom is willing to spend on buying new toys.\n\nThe next line contains $ n $ distinct integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the types of toys that Tanya already has.",
    "outputFormat": "In the first line print a single integer $ k $ \u2014 the number of different types of toys that Tanya should choose so that the number of different types of toys in her collection is maximum possible. Of course, the total cost of the selected toys should not exceed $ m $ .\n\nIn the second line print $ k $ distinct space-separated integers $ t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{k} $ ( $ 1<=t_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the types of toys that Tanya should choose.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you may print any of them. Values of $ t_{i} $ can be printed in any order.",
