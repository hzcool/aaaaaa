    "description": "Burenka and Tonya are playing an old Buryat game with a chip on a board of $ n \\times m $ cells.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the chip is located in the lower left corner of the board. In one move, the player can move the chip to the right or up by any odd number of cells (but you cannot move the chip both to the right and up in one move). The one who cannot make a move loses.\n\nBurenka makes the first move, the players take turns. Burenka really wants to win the game, but she is too lazy to come up with a strategy, so you are invited to solve the difficult task of finding it. Name the winner of the game (it is believed that Burenka and Tonya are masters of playing with chips, so they always move in the optimal way).\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1719A/a6c823a6eb354fdb9ffdf07a308c103419371a6a.png)Chip's starting cell is green, the only cell from which chip can't move is red. if the chip is in the yellow cell, then blue cells are all options to move the chip in one move.",

    "hint": "In the first case, Burenka has no move, so Tonya wins.\n\nIn the second case, Burenka can move $ 3 $ cells to the right, after which Tony will not be able to make a move, which means that Burenka wins.\n\nIn the third case, Burenka can move $ 5 $ squares to the right. Then we can say that we have a game on a board of $ 1 \\times 5 $ cells, and Tonya is the first player. In such game the second player wins, so in the original one Burenka will win.",
