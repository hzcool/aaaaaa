    "description": "There are $ n $ players numbered from $ 0 $ to $ n-1 $ with ranks. The $ i $ -th player has rank $ i $ .\n\nPlayers can form teams: the team should consist of three players and no pair of players in the team should have a conflict. The rank of the team is calculated using the following algorithm: let $ i $ , $ j $ , $ k $ be the ranks of players in the team and $ i < j < k $ , then the rank of the team is equal to $ A \\cdot i + B \\cdot j + C \\cdot k $ .\n\nYou are given information about the pairs of players who have a conflict. Calculate the total sum of ranks over all possible valid teams modulo $ 2^{64} $ .",
