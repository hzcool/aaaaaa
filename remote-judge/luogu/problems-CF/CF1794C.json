    "description": "The score of a sequence $ [s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_d] $ is defined as $ \\displaystyle \\frac{s_1\\cdot s_2\\cdot \\ldots \\cdot s_d}{d!} $ , where $ d!=1\\cdot 2\\cdot \\ldots \\cdot d $ . In particular, the score of an empty sequence is $ 1 $ .\n\nFor a sequence $ [s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_d] $ , let $ m $ be the maximum score among all its subsequences. Its cost is defined as the maximum length of a subsequence with a score of $ m $ .\n\nYou are given a non-decreasing sequence $ [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n] $ of integers of length $ n $ . In other words, the condition $ a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq a_n $ is satisfied. For each $ k=1, 2, \\ldots , n $ , find the cost of the sequence $ [a_1, a_2, \\ldots , a_k] $ .\n\nA sequence $ x $ is a subsequence of a sequence $ y $ if $ x $ can be obtained from $ y $ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ).

    "hint": "In the first test case:\n\n- The maximum score among the subsequences of $ [1] $ is $ 1 $ . The subsequences $ [1] $ and $ [] $ (the empty sequence) are the only ones with this score. Thus, the cost of $ [1] $ is $ 1 $ .\n- The maximum score among the subsequences of $ [1, 2] $ is $ 2 $ . The only subsequence with this score is $ [2] $ . Thus, the cost of $ [1, 2] $ is $ 1 $ .\n- The maximum score among the subsequences of $ [1, 2, 3] $ is $ 3 $ . The subsequences $ [2, 3] $ and $ [3] $ are the only ones with this score. Thus, the cost of $ [1, 2, 3] $ is $ 2 $ .\n\n Therefore, the answer to this case is $ 1\\:\\:1\\:\\:2 $ , which are the costs of $ [1], [1, 2] $ and $ [1, 2, 3] $ in this order.",
