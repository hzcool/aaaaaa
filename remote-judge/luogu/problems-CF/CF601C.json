    "description": "Kleof\u00e1\u0161 is participating in an $ n $ -thlon - a tournament consisting of $ n $ different competitions in $ n $ different disciplines (numbered $ 1 $ through $ n $ ). There are $ m $ participants in the $ n $ -thlon and each of them participates in all competitions.\n\nIn each of these $ n $ competitions, the participants are given ranks from $ 1 $ to $ m $ in such a way that no two participants are given the same rank - in other words, the ranks in each competition form a permutation of numbers from $ 1 $ to $ m $ . The score of a participant in a competition is equal to his/her rank in it.\n\nThe overall score of each participant is computed as the sum of that participant's scores in all competitions.\n\nThe overall rank of each participant is equal to $ 1+k $ , where $ k $ is the number of participants with strictly smaller overall score.\n\nThe $ n $ -thlon is over now, but the results haven't been published yet. Kleof\u00e1\u0161 still remembers his ranks in each particular competition; however, he doesn't remember anything about how well the other participants did. Therefore, Kleof\u00e1\u0161 would like to know his expected overall rank.\n\nAll competitors are equally good at each discipline, so all rankings (permutations of ranks of everyone except Kleof\u00e1\u0161) in each competition are equiprobable.",

The $ i $ -th of them contains one integer $ x_{i} $ ( $ 1<=x_{i}<=m $ ) \u2014 the rank of Kleof\u00e1\u0161 in the $ i $ -th competition.",
