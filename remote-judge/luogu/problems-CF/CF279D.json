Initially each variable $ b_{i} $ $ (1<=i<=m) $ contains the value of zero. Consider the following sequence, consisting of $ n $ operations.\n\nThe first operation is assigning the value of $ a_{1} $ to some variable $ b_{x} $ $ (1<=x<=m) $ . Each of the following $ n-1 $ operations is assigning to some variable $ b_{y} $ the value that is equal to the sum of values that are stored in the variables $ b_{i} $ and $ b_{j} $ $ (1<=i,j,y<=m) $ . At that, the value that is assigned on the $ t $ -th operation, must equal $ a_{t} $ . For each operation numbers $ y,i,j $ are chosen anew.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of variables $ m $ , such that those variables can help you perform the described sequence of operations.",
