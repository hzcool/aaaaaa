    "description": "You are given a cube of size $ k\u00d7k\u00d7k $ , which consists of unit cubes. Two unit cubes are considered neighbouring, if they have common face.\n\nYour task is to paint each of $ k^{3} $ unit cubes one of two colours (black or white), so that the following conditions must be satisfied:\n\n- each white cube has exactly 2 neighbouring cubes of white color;\n- each black cube has exactly 2 neighbouring cubes of black color.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ k $ $ (1<=k<=100) $ , which is size of the cube.",
    "outputFormat": "Print -1 if there is no solution. Otherwise, print the required painting of the cube consequently by layers. Print a $ k\u00d7k $ matrix in the first $ k $ lines, showing how the first layer of the cube should be painted. In the following $ k $ lines print a $ k\u00d7k $ matrix \u2014 the way the second layer should be painted. And so on to the last $ k $ -th layer. Note that orientation of the cube in the space does not matter.\n\nMark a white unit cube with symbol \"w\" and a black one with \"b\". Use the format of output data, given in the test samples. You may print extra empty lines, they will be ignored.",
