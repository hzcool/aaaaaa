    "description": "Rubik is very keen on number permutations.\n\nA permutation $ a $ with length $ n $ is a sequence, consisting of $ n $ different numbers from 1 to $ n $ . Element number $ i $ $ (1<=i<=n) $ of this permutation will be denoted as $ a_{i} $ .\n\nFurik decided to make a present to Rubik and came up with a new problem on permutations. Furik tells Rubik two number permutations: permutation $ a $ with length $ n $ and permutation $ b $ with length $ m $ . Rubik must give an answer to the problem: how many distinct integers $ d $ exist, such that sequence $ c $ $ (c_{1}=a_{1}+d,c_{2}=a_{2}+d,...,c_{n}=a_{n}+d) $ of length $ n $ is a subsequence of $ b $ .\n\nSequence $ a $ is a subsequence of sequence $ b $ , if there are such indices $ i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{n} $ $ (1<=i_{1}&lt;i_{2}&lt;...&lt;i_{n}<=m) $ , that $ a_{1}=b_{i1} $ , $ a_{2}=b_{i2} $ , $ ... $ , $ a_{n}=b_{in} $ , where $ n $ is the length of sequence $ a $ , and $ m $ is the length of sequence $ b $ .\n\nYou are given permutations $ a $ and $ b $ , help Rubik solve the given problem.",
