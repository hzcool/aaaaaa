    "description": "In this task Anna and Maria play the following game. Initially they have a checkered piece of paper with a painted $ n\u00d7m $ rectangle (only the border, no filling). Anna and Maria move in turns and Anna starts. During each move one should paint inside the last-painted rectangle a new lesser rectangle (along the grid lines). The new rectangle should have no common points with the previous one. Note that when we paint a rectangle, we always paint only the border, the rectangles aren't filled.\n\nNobody wins the game \u2014 Anna and Maria simply play until they have done $ k $ moves in total. Count the number of different ways to play this game.",

    "outputFormat": "Print the single number \u2014 the number of the ways to play the game. As this number can be very big, print the value modulo $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ).",

In other words, if one way contains a rectangle that is not contained in the other way.\n\nIn the first sample Anna, who performs her first and only move, has only one possible action plan \u2014 insert a $ 1\u00d71 $ square inside the given $ 3\u00d73 $ square.\n\nIn the second sample Anna has as much as 9 variants: 4 ways to paint a $ 1\u00d71 $ square, 2 ways to insert a $ 1\u00d72 $ rectangle vertically, 2 more ways to insert it horizontally and one more way is to insert a $ 2\u00d72 $ square.",
