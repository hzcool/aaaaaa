    "description": "Alyona's mother wants to present an array of $ n $ non-negative integers to Alyona. The array should be special.\n\nAlyona is a capricious girl so after she gets the array, she inspects $ m $ of its subarrays. Subarray is a set of some subsequent elements of the array. The $ i $ -th subarray is described with two integers $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ , and its elements are $ a[l_{i}],a[l_{i}+1],...,a[r_{i}] $ .\n\nAlyona is going to find mex for each of the chosen subarrays. Among these $ m $ mexes the girl is going to find the smallest. She wants this minimum mex to be as large as possible.\n\nYou are to find an array $ a $ of $ n $ elements so that the minimum mex among those chosen by Alyona subarrays is as large as possible.\n\nThe mex of a set $ S $ is a minimum possible non-negative integer that is not in $ S $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=10^{5} $ ).\n\nThe next $ m $ lines contain information about the subarrays chosen by Alyona. The $ i $ -th of these lines contains two integers $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=n $ ), that describe the subarray $ a[l_{i}],a[l_{i}+1],...,a[r_{i}] $ .",
    "outputFormat": "In the first line print single integer \u2014 the maximum possible minimum mex.\n\nIn the second line print $ n $ integers \u2014 the array $ a $ . All the elements in $ a $ should be between $ 0 $ and $ 10^{9} $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is an optimal answer in which all the elements in $ a $ are between $ 0 $ and $ 10^{9} $ .\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
