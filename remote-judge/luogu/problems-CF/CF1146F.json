    "description": "You are given a rooted tree with $ n $ nodes, labeled from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The tree is rooted at node $ 1 $ . The parent of the $ i $ -th node is $ p_i $ . A leaf is node with no children. For a given set of leaves $ L $ , let $ f(L) $ denote the smallest connected subgraph that contains all leaves $ L $ .\n\nYou would like to partition the leaves such that for any two different sets $ x, y $ of the partition, $ f(x) $ and $ f(y) $ are disjoint.\n\nCount the number of ways to partition the leaves, modulo $ 998244353 $ . Two ways are different if there are two leaves such that they are in the same set in one way but in different sets in the other.",
