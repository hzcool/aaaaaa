Cities are numerated from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .\n\nTwo fairs are currently taking place in Berland \u2014 they are held in two different cities $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1 \\le a, b \\le n $ ; $ a \\ne b $ ).\n\nFind the number of pairs of cities $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ x \\ne a, x \\ne b, y \\ne a, y \\ne b $ ) such that if you go from $ x $ to $ y $ you will have to go through both fairs (the order of visits doesn't matter). Formally, you need to find the number of pairs of cities $ x,y $ such that any path from $ x $ to $ y $ goes through $ a $ and $ b $ (in any order).\n\nPrint the required number of pairs. The order of two cities in a pair does not matter, that is, the pairs $ (x,y) $ and $ (y,x) $ must be taken into account only once.",
