    "description": "Kuroni isn't good at economics. So he decided to found a new financial pyramid called Antihype. It has the following rules:\n\n1. You can join the pyramid for free and get $ 0 $ coins.\n2. If you are already a member of Antihype, you can invite your friend who is currently not a member of Antihype, and get a number of coins equal to your age (for each friend you invite).\n\n $ n $ people have heard about Antihype recently, the $ i $ -th person's age is $ a_i $ . Some of them are friends, but friendship is a weird thing now: the $ i $ -th person is a friend of the $ j $ -th person if and only if $ a_i \\text{ AND } a_j = 0 $ , where $ \\text{AND} $ denotes the [bitwise AND operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND).\n\nNobody among the $ n $ people is a member of Antihype at the moment. They want to cooperate to join and invite each other to Antihype in a way that maximizes their combined gainings. Could you help them?",
