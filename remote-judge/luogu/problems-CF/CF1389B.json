You can perform two kinds of moves:\n\n1. move right \u2014 go from your current index $ x $ to $ x+1 $ and add $ a_{x+1} $ to your score. This move can only be performed if $ x<n $ .\n2. move left \u2014 go from your current index $ x $ to $ x-1 $ and add $ a_{x-1} $ to your score. This move can only be performed if $ x>1 $ . Also, you can't perform two or more moves to the left in a row.\n\nYou want to perform exactly $ k $ moves. Also, there should be no more than $ z $ moves to the left among them.\n\nWhat is the maximum score you can achieve?",

So you make four moves to the right and obtain the score $ a_1 + a_2       + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 $ .\n\nIn the second example you can move one time to the left. So we can follow these moves: right, right, left, right. The score will be $ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_2 + a_3 $ .\n\nIn the third example you can move four times to the left but it's not optimal anyway, you can just move four times to the right and obtain the score $ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 $ .",
