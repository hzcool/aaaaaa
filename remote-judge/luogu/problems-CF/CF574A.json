    "description": "Limak is a grizzly bear who desires power and adoration. He wants to win in upcoming elections and rule over the Bearland.\n\nThere are $ n $ candidates, including Limak. We know how many citizens are going to vote for each candidate. Now $ i $ -th candidate would get $ a_{i} $ votes. Limak is candidate number $ 1 $ . To win in elections, he must get strictly more votes than any other candidate.\n\nVictory is more important than everything else so Limak decided to cheat. He will steal votes from his opponents by bribing some citizens. To bribe a citizen, Limak must give him or her one candy - citizens are bears and bears like candies. Limak doesn't have many candies and wonders - how many citizens does he have to bribe?",

Limak is candidate number $ 1 $ .\n\nNote that after bribing number of votes for some candidate might be zero or might be greater than $ 1000 $ .",

Then numbers of votes would be $ 9,1,7,2,8 $ (Limak would have $ 9 $ votes). Alternatively, Limak could steal only $ 3 $ votes from the third candidate and $ 1 $ vote from the second candidate to get situation $ 9,0,8,2,8 $ .\n\nIn the second sample Limak will steal $ 2 $ votes from each candidate. Situation will be $ 7,6,6,6 $ .\n\nIn the third sample Limak is a winner without bribing any citizen.",
