    "description": "This is an interactive problem.\n\nImur Ishakov decided to organize a club for people who love to play the famous game \u00abThe hat\u00bb. The club was visited by $ n $ students, where $ n $ is even. Imur arranged them all in a circle and held a draw to break the students in pairs, but something went wrong. The participants are numbered so that participant $ i $ and participant $ i+1 $ ( $ 1<=i<=n-1 $ ) are adjacent, as well as participant $ n $ and participant $ 1 $ . Each student was given a piece of paper with a number in such a way, that for every two adjacent students, these numbers differ exactly by one. The plan was to form students with the same numbers in a pair, but it turned out that not all numbers appeared exactly twice.\n\nAs you know, the most convenient is to explain the words to the partner when he is sitting exactly across you. Students with numbers $ i $ and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1019B/59f224a8151ecadc368b840c31ed2d1a88e25415.png) sit across each other. Imur is wondering if there are two people sitting across each other with the same numbers given. Help him to find such pair of people if it exists.\n\nYou can ask questions of form \u00abwhich number was received by student $ i $ ?\u00bb, and the goal is to determine whether the desired pair exists in no more than $ 60 $ questions.",
    "inputFormat": "At the beginning the even integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=100000 $ ) is given \u2014 the total number of students.\n\nYou are allowed to ask no more than $ 60 $ questions.",
    "outputFormat": "To ask the question about the student $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ), you should print \u00ab? $ i $ \u00bb. Then from standard output you can read the number $ a_{i} $ received by student $ i $ ( $ -10^{9}<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ).\n\nWhen you find the desired pair, you should print \u00ab! $ i $ \u00bb, where $ i $ is any student who belongs to the pair ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ). If you determined that such pair doesn't exist, you should output \u00ab! -1\u00bb. In both cases you should immediately terminate the program.\n\nThe query that contains your answer is not counted towards the limit of $ 60 $ queries.\n\nPlease make sure to flush the standard output after each command. For example, in C++ use function fflush(stdout), in Java call System.out.flush(), in Pascal use flush(output) and stdout.flush() for Python language.\n\nHacking\n\nUse the following format for hacking:\n\nIn the first line, print one even integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=100000 $ ) \u2014 the total number of students.\n\nIn the second line print $ n $ integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) separated by spaces, where $ a_{i} $ is the number to give to $ i $ -th student. Any two adjacent elements, including $ n $ and $ 1 $ , must differ by $ 1 $ or $ -1 $ .\n\nThe hacked solution will not have direct access to the sequence $ a_{i} $ .",
