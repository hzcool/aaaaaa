    "description": "Polycarp got an array of integers $ a[1 \\dots n] $ as a gift. Now he wants to perform a certain number of operations (possibly zero) so that all elements of the array become the same (that is, to become $ a_1=a_2=\\dots=a_n $ ).\n\n- In one operation, he can take some indices in the array and increase the elements of the array at those indices by $ 1 $ .\n\nFor example, let $ a=[4,2,1,6,2] $ . He can perform the following operation: select indices 1, 2, and 4 and increase elements of the array in those indices by $ 1 $ . As a result, in one operation, he can get a new state of the array $ a=[5,3,1,7,2] $ .\n\nWhat is the minimum number of operations it can take so that all elements of the array become equal to each other (that is, to become $ a_1=a_2=\\dots=a_n $ )?",
