    "description": "Phoenix is picking berries in his backyard. There are $ n $ shrubs, and each shrub has $ a_i $ red berries and $ b_i $ blue berries.\n\nEach basket can contain $ k $ berries. But, Phoenix has decided that each basket may only contain berries from the same shrub or berries of the same color (red or blue). In other words, all berries in a basket must be from the same shrub or/and have the same color.\n\nFor example, if there are two shrubs with $ 5 $ red and $ 2 $ blue berries in the first shrub and $ 2 $ red and $ 1 $ blue berries in the second shrub then Phoenix can fill $ 2 $ baskets of capacity $ 4 $ completely:\n\n- the first basket will contain $ 3 $ red and $ 1 $ blue berries from the first shrub;\n- the second basket will contain the $ 2 $ remaining red berries from the first shrub and $ 2 $ red berries from the second shrub.\n\nHelp Phoenix determine the maximum number of baskets he can fill completely!",
