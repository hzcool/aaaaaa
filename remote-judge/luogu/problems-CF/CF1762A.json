It can be proven that it is always possible to make $ a $ good.\n\n $ ^\\dagger $ $ \\lfloor x \\rfloor $ denotes the floor function \u2014 the largest integer less than or equal to $ x $ .

After performing on index $ 2 $ again, $ a $ becomes $ [7,1] $ , which is good. It can be proved that it is not possible to make $ a $ good in less number of operations.\n\nIn the third test case, $ a $ becomes $ [0,2,4] $ if we perform the operation on index $ 1 $ once. As $ [0,2,4] $ is good, answer is $ 1 $ .\n\nIn the fourth test case, we need to perform the operation on index $ 1 $ four times. After all operations, $ a $ becomes $ [0] $ .
