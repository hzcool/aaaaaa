    "description": "Barney lives in country USC (United States of Charzeh). USC has $ n $ cities numbered from $ 1 $ through $ n $ and $ n-1 $ roads between them. Cities and roads of USC form a rooted tree (Barney's not sure why it is rooted). Root of the tree is the city number $ 1 $ . Thus if one will start his journey from city $ 1 $ , he can visit any city he wants by following roads.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF696B/ba3e1e6f719802c9fe4b318c8d8513024bc088eb.png)Some girl has stolen Barney's heart, and Barney wants to find her. He starts looking for in the root of the tree and (since he is Barney Stinson not a random guy), he uses a random DFS to search in the cities. A pseudo code of this algorithm is as follows:\n\n```plain\nlet starting_time be an array of length n\ncurrent_time = 0\ndfs(v):\n\tcurrent_time = current_time + 1\n\tstarting_time[v] = current_time\n\tshuffle children[v] randomly (each permutation with equal possibility)\n\t// children[v] is vector of children cities of city v\n\tfor u in children[v]:\n\t\tdfs(u)\n```\n\nAs told before, Barney will start his journey in the root of the tree (equivalent to call dfs(1)).\n\nNow Barney needs to pack a backpack and so he wants to know more about his upcoming journey: for every city $ i $ , Barney wants to know the expected value of starting\\_time\\[i\\]. He's a friend of Jon Snow and knows nothing, that's why he asked for your help.",
