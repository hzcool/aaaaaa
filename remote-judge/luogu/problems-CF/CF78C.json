    "description": "Two beavers, Timur and Marsel, play the following game.\n\nThere are $ n $ logs, each of exactly $ m $ meters in length. The beavers move in turns. For each move a beaver chooses a log and gnaws it into some number (more than one) of equal parts, the length of each one is expressed by an integer and is no less than $ k $ meters. Each resulting part is also a log which can be gnawed in future by any beaver. The beaver that can't make a move loses. Thus, the other beaver wins.\n\nTimur makes the first move. The players play in the optimal way. Determine the winner.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,m,k<=10^{9} $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "Print \"Timur\", if Timur wins, or \"Marsel\", if Marsel wins. You should print everything without the quotes.",
    "samples": [
        [
            "1 15 4\n",
            "Timur"
        ],
        [
            "4 9 5\n",
            "Marsel"
        ]
    ],
    "hint": "In the first sample the beavers only have one log, of $ 15 $ meters in length. Timur moves first. The only move he can do is to split the log into $ 3 $ parts each $ 5 $ meters in length. Then Marsel moves but he can't split any of the resulting logs, as $ k=4 $ . Thus, the winner is Timur.\n\nIn the second example the beavers have $ 4 $ logs $ 9 $ meters in length. Timur can't split any of them, so that the resulting parts possessed the length of not less than $ 5 $ meters, that's why he loses instantly.",
