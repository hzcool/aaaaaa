    "description": "A bitstring is a string that contains only the characters 0 and 1.\n\nKoyomi Kanou is working hard towards her dream of becoming a writer. To practice, she decided to participate in the Binary Novel Writing Contest. The writing prompt for the contest consists of three bitstrings of length $ 2n $ . A valid novel for the contest is a bitstring of length at most $ 3n $ that contains at least two of the three given strings as subsequences.\n\nKoyomi has just received the three prompt strings from the contest organizers. Help her write a valid novel for the contest.\n\nA string $ a $ is a subsequence of a string $ b $ if $ a $ can be obtained from $ b $ by deletion of several (possibly, zero) characters.",

It is guaranteed that these three strings are pairwise distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ across all test cases does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
