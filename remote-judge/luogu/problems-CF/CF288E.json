    "description": "Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers that contain only lucky digits 4 and 7 in their decimal representation. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.\n\nPolo the Penguin have two positive integers $ l $ and $ r $ $ (l&lt;r) $ , both of them are lucky numbers. Moreover, their lengths (that is, the number of digits in the decimal representation without the leading zeroes) are equal to each other.\n\nLet's assume that $ n $ is the number of distinct lucky numbers, each of them cannot be greater than $ r $ or less than $ l $ , and $ a_{i} $ is the $ i $ -th (in increasing order) number of them. Find $ a_{1}\u00b7a_{2}+a_{2}\u00b7a_{3}+...+a_{n-1}\u00b7a_{n} $ . As the answer can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing it by $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ).",
