    "description": "There are two rival donut shops.\n\nThe first shop sells donuts at retail: each donut costs $ a $ dollars.\n\nThe second shop sells donuts only in bulk: box of $ b $ donuts costs $ c $ dollars. So if you want to buy $ x $ donuts from this shop, then you have to buy the smallest number of boxes such that the total number of donuts in them is greater or equal to $ x $ .\n\nYou want to determine two positive integer values:\n\n1. how many donuts can you buy so that they are strictly cheaper in the first shop than in the second shop?\n2. how many donuts can you buy so that they are strictly cheaper in the second shop than in the first shop?\n\nIf any of these values doesn't exist then that value should be equal to $ -1 $ . If there are multiple possible answers, then print any of them.\n\n The printed values should be less or equal to $ 10^9 $ . It can be shown that under the given constraints such values always exist if any values exist at all.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le       1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nEach of the next $ t $ lines contains three integers $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ ( $ 1 \\le a \\le 10^9 $ , $ 2 \\le b \\le       10^9 $ , $ 1 \\le c \\le 10^9 $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "For each testcase print two positive integers.

    "hint": "In the first testcase buying any number of donuts will be cheaper in the second shop. For example, for $ 3 $ or $ 5 $ donuts you'll have to buy a box of $ 10 $ donuts for $ 4 $ dollars. $ 3 $ or $ 5 $ donuts in the first shop would cost you $ 15 $ or $ 25 $ dollars, respectively, however. For $ 20 $ donuts you'll have to buy two boxes for $ 8 $ dollars total. Note that $ 3 $ and $ 5 $ are also valid answers for the second shop, along with many other answers.\n\nIn the second testcase buying any number of donuts will be either cheaper in the first shop or the same price. $ 8 $ donuts cost $ 32 $ dollars in the first shop and $ 40 $ dollars in the second shop (because you have to buy two boxes). $ 10 $ donuts will cost $ 40 $ dollars in both shops, so $ 10 $ is not a valid answer for any of the shops.\n\nIn the third testcase $ 1 $ donut costs $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ dollars, respectively. $ 2 $ donuts cost $ 4 $ and $ 3 $ dollars. Thus, $ 1 $ is a valid answer for the first shop and $ 2 $ is a valid answer for the second shop.\n\nIn the fourth testcase $ 10^9 $ donuts cost $ 10^{18} $ dollars in the first shop and $ 10^9 $ dollars in the second shop.",
