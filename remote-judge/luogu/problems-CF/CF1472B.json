    "description": "Alice and Bob received $ n $ candies from their parents. Each candy weighs either 1 gram or 2 grams. Now they want to divide all candies among themselves fairly so that the total weight of Alice's candies is equal to the total weight of Bob's candies.\n\nCheck if they can do that.\n\nNote that candies are not allowed to be cut in half.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of candies that Alice and Bob received.\n\nThe next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ \u2014 the weights of the candies. The weight of each candy is either $ 1 $ or $ 2 $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, output on a separate line:\n\n- \"YES\", if all candies can be divided into two sets with the same weight;\n- \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).",

    "hint": "In the first test case, Alice and Bob can each take one candy, then both will have a total weight of $ 1 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, any division will be unfair.\n\nIn the third test case, both Alice and Bob can take two candies, one of weight $ 1 $ and one of weight $ 2 $ .\n\nIn the fourth test case, it is impossible to divide three identical candies between two people.\n\nIn the fifth test case, any division will also be unfair.",
