    "description": "The Free Meteor Association (FMA) has got a problem: as meteors are moving, the Universal Cosmic Descriptive Humorous Program (UCDHP) needs to add a special module that would analyze this movement.\n\nUCDHP stores some secret information about meteors as an $ n\u00d7m $ table with integers in its cells. The order of meteors in the Universe is changing. That's why the main UCDHP module receives the following queries:\n\n- The query to swap two table rows;\n- The query to swap two table columns;\n- The query to obtain a secret number in a particular table cell.\n\nAs the main UCDHP module is critical, writing the functional of working with the table has been commissioned to you.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three space-separated integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=1000 $ , $ 1<=k<=500000 $ ) \u2014 the number of table columns and rows and the number of queries, correspondingly.\n\nNext $ n $ lines contain $ m $ space-separated numbers each \u2014 the initial state of the table. Each number $ p $ in the table is an integer and satisfies the inequality $ 0<=p<=10^{6} $ .\n\nNext $ k $ lines contain queries in the format \" $ s_{i} $ $ x_{i} $ $ y_{i} $ \", where $ s_{i} $ is one of the characters \"\u0441\", \"r\" or \"g\", and $ x_{i} $ , $ y_{i} $ are two integers.\n\n- If $ s_{i} $ = \"c\", then the current query is the query to swap columns with indexes $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ 1<=x,y<=m,x\u2260y $ );\n- If $ s_{i} $ = \"r\", then the current query is the query to swap rows with indexes $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ 1<=x,y<=n,x\u2260y $ );\n- If $ s_{i} $ = \"g\", then the current query is the query to obtain the number that located in the $ x_{i} $ -th row and in the $ y_{i} $ -th column ( $ 1<=x<=n,1<=y<=m $ ).\n\nThe table rows are considered to be indexed from top to bottom from 1 to $ n $ , and the table columns \u2014 from left to right from 1 to $ m $ .",
