    "description": "Phoenix has decided to become a scientist! He is currently investigating the growth of bacteria.\n\nInitially, on day $ 1 $ , there is one bacterium with mass $ 1 $ .\n\nEvery day, some number of bacteria will split (possibly zero or all). When a bacterium of mass $ m $ splits, it becomes two bacteria of mass $ \\frac{m}{2} $ each. For example, a bacterium of mass $ 3 $ can split into two bacteria of mass $ 1.5 $ .\n\nAlso, every night, the mass of every bacteria will increase by one.\n\nPhoenix is wondering if it is possible for the total mass of all the bacteria to be exactly $ n $ . If it is possible, he is interested in the way to obtain that mass using the minimum possible number of nights. Help him become the best scientist!",
    "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the sum of bacteria masses that Phoenix is interested in.",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there is no way for the bacteria to exactly achieve total mass $ n $ , print -1. Otherwise, print two lines.\n\nThe first line should contain an integer $ d $ \u2014 the minimum number of nights needed.\n\nThe next line should contain $ d $ integers, with the $ i $ -th integer representing the number of bacteria that should split on the $ i $ -th day.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any.",

    "hint": "In the first test case, the following process results in bacteria with total mass $ 9 $ :\n\n- Day $ 1 $ : The bacterium with mass $ 1 $ splits. There are now two bacteria with mass $ 0.5 $ each.\n- Night $ 1 $ : All bacteria's mass increases by one. There are now two bacteria with mass $ 1.5 $ .\n- Day $ 2 $ : None split.\n- Night $ 2 $ : There are now two bacteria with mass $ 2.5 $ .\n- Day $ 3 $ : Both bacteria split. There are now four bacteria with mass $ 1.25 $ .\n- Night $ 3 $ : There are now four bacteria with mass $ 2.25 $ .\n\n The total mass is $ 2.25+2.25+2.25+2.25=9 $ . It can be proved that $ 3 $ is the minimum number of nights needed. There are also other ways to obtain total mass 9 in 3 nights.  $   $\n\nIn the second test case, the following process results in bacteria with total mass $ 11 $ :\n\n- Day $ 1 $ : The bacterium with mass $ 1 $ splits. There are now two bacteria with mass $ 0.5 $ .\n- Night $ 1 $ : There are now two bacteria with mass $ 1.5 $ .\n- Day $ 2 $ : One bacterium splits. There are now three bacteria with masses $ 0.75 $ , $ 0.75 $ , and $ 1.5 $ .\n- Night $ 2 $ : There are now three bacteria with masses $ 1.75 $ , $ 1.75 $ , and $ 2.5 $ .\n- Day $ 3 $ : The bacteria with mass $ 1.75 $ and the bacteria with mass $ 2.5 $ split. There are now five bacteria with masses $ 0.875 $ , $ 0.875 $ , $ 1.25 $ , $ 1.25 $ , and $ 1.75 $ .\n- Night $ 3 $ : There are now five bacteria with masses $ 1.875 $ , $ 1.875 $ , $ 2.25 $ , $ 2.25 $ , and $ 2.75 $ .\n\n The total mass is $ 1.875+1.875+2.25+2.25+2.75=11 $ . It can be proved that $ 3 $ is the minimum number of nights needed. There are also other ways to obtain total mass 11 in 3 nights.  $   $\n\nIn the third test case, the bacterium does not split on day $ 1 $ , and then grows to mass $ 2 $ during night $ 1 $ .",
