    "description": "The Smart Beaver from ABBYY got hooked on square matrices. Now he is busy studying an $ n\u00d7n $ size matrix, where $ n $ is odd. The Smart Beaver considers the following matrix elements good:\n\n- Elements of the main diagonal.\n- Elements of the secondary diagonal.\n- Elements of the \"middle\" row \u2014 the row which has exactly ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF177A1/020372175e2da20d0daf928d1765e1cdfd92e9c2.png) rows above it and the same number of rows below it.\n- Elements of the \"middle\" column \u2014 the column that has exactly ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF177A1/020372175e2da20d0daf928d1765e1cdfd92e9c2.png) columns to the left of it and the same number of columns to the right of it.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF177A1/2b1f0b5214c06b926f48074a744279cf777800a8.png) The figure shows a $ 5\u00d75 $ matrix.
