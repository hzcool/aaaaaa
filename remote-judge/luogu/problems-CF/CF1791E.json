In other words choose an index $ i $ such that $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n - 1 $ and assign $ a_i = -a_i $ and $ a_{i+1} = -a_{i+1} $ .",

The descriptions of the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot10^5 $ ) \u2014 the length of the array.\n\nThe following line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n $ ( $ -10^9 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9 $ ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2\\cdot10^5 $ .",

    "hint": "For the first test case, by performing the operation on the first two elements, we can change the array from $ [-1, -1, -1] $ to $ [1, 1, -1] $ , and it can be proven this array obtains the maximum possible sum which is $ 1 + 1 + (-1) = 1 $ .\n\nFor the second test case, by performing the operation on $ -5 $ and $ 0 $ , we change the array from $ [1, 5, -5, 0, 2] $ to $ [1, 5, -(-5), -0, 2] = [1, 5, 5, 0, 2] $ , which has the maximum sum since all elements are non-negative. So, the answer is $ 1 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 2 = 13 $ .\n\nFor the third test case, the array already contains only positive numbers, so performing operations is unnecessary. The answer is just the sum of the whole array, which is $ 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 $ .",
