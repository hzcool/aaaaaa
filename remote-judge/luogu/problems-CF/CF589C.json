    "description": "Inspired by success of Joanne Rowling and her fantasy series of Harry Potter, Polycarp decided to create his own masterpiece. He has already picked a name for his future bestseller \u2014 string $ s $ .\n\nPolycarp faced a number of difficulties while he was working on the main story of his book so he decided to become Malevich in a literature and create his own \"Black Square\".\n\nChapters of his masterpiece were written by Polycarp in $ n $ days. He started from writing down the string $ s $ . Every day (during the following $ n $ days) he did the following procedure: on the $ i $ -th day he added to the right of current text $ t $ its $ k_{i} $ -th circular shift. It means that every day content of his masterpiece doubled in size.\n\nCircular shift of a string $ r $ is defined as a string resulted after movement of the last character of $ r $ to the first position in the string. As an example: circular shift of \u00abmasterpiece\u00bb is \u00abemasterpiec\u00bb. The $ i $ -th circular shift of a string $ r $ is defined as a string resulted after applying $ i $ subsequent circular shifts of the string $ r $ (e.g., the third circular shift of \u00abmasterpiece\u00bb is \u00abecemasterpi\u00bb).\n\nAfter $ n $ days of tedious work Polycarp managed to write a very long text deserving the efforts made. However, text of his masterpiece was so long that it was nearly impossible to do any analysis of its content.\n\nHelp Polycarp to answer $ m $ requests about his masterpiece: for the $ j $ -th request you will need to find how many times a letter $ c_{j} $ is contained in a substring of his masterpiece starting from position $ l_{j} $ and ending at $ r_{j} $ inclusively.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a name of the masterpiece \u2014 string $ s $ . The string $ s $ contains only lowercase latin letters and its length is between 1 and 100 inclusively.\n\nThe second line contains a pair of integer numbers $ n $ and $ m $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5},1<=m<=10^{5}) $ \u2014 a number of days Polycarp worked on his masterpiece and a number of requests you need to answer for the text respectively.\n\nThe next line consists of $ n $ integer numbers $ k_{i} $ $ (0<=k_{i}<=100) $ \u2014 circular shifts used during $ n $ days of work.\n\nFollowing $ m $ lines contains two integer numbers $ l_{j},r_{j} $ and a lowercase latin letter $ c_{j} $ each \u2014 requests description. For each request you need to count number of times letter $ c_{j} $ is contained in a substring of the masterpiece from position $ l_{j} $ to $ r_{j} $ inclusively. Positions are numerated starting from $ 1 $ . It is guaranteed that $ 1<=l_{j}<=r_{j}<=10^{18} $ and both $ l_{j} $ and $ r_{j} $ do not exceed length of the masterpiece.",
    "outputFormat": "Output should contain $ m $ lines, where the $ j $ -th line contains the answer on the $ j $ -th request.",
