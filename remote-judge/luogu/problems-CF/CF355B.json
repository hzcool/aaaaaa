    "description": "Vasya often uses public transport. The transport in the city is of two types: trolleys and buses. The city has $ n $ buses and $ m $ trolleys, the buses are numbered by integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , the trolleys are numbered by integers from $ 1 $ to $ m $ .\n\nPublic transport is not free. There are 4 types of tickets:\n\n1. A ticket for one ride on some bus or trolley. It costs $ c_{1} $ burles;\n2. A ticket for an unlimited number of rides on some bus or on some trolley. It costs $ c_{2} $ burles;\n3. A ticket for an unlimited number of rides on all buses or all trolleys. It costs $ c_{3} $ burles;\n4. A ticket for an unlimited number of rides on all buses and trolleys. It costs $ c_{4} $ burles.\n\nVasya knows for sure the number of rides he is going to make and the transport he is going to use. He asked you for help to find the minimum sum of burles he will have to spend on the tickets.",
