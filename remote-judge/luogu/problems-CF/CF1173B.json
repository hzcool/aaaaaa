    "description": "Nauuo is a girl who loves playing chess.\n\nOne day she invented a game by herself which needs $ n $ chess pieces to play on a $ m\\times m $ chessboard. The rows and columns are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ m $ . We denote a cell on the intersection of the $ r $ -th row and $ c $ -th column as $ (r,c) $ .\n\nThe game's goal is to place $ n $ chess pieces numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ on the chessboard, the $ i $ -th piece lies on $ (r_i,\\,c_i) $ , while the following rule is satisfied: for all pairs of pieces $ i $ and $ j $ , $ |r_i-r_j|+|c_i-c_j|\\ge|i-j| $ . Here $ |x| $ means the absolute value of $ x $ .\n\nHowever, Nauuo discovered that sometimes she couldn't find a solution because the chessboard was too small.\n\nShe wants to find the smallest chessboard on which she can put $ n $ pieces according to the rules.\n\nShe also wonders how to place the pieces on such a chessboard. Can you help her?",
    "inputFormat": "The only line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1\\le n\\le 1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of chess pieces for the game.",
    "outputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer \u2014 the minimum value of $ m $ , where $ m $ is the length of sides of the suitable chessboard.\n\nThe $ i $ -th of the next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ r_i $ and $ c_i $ ( $ 1\\le r_i,c_i\\le m $ ) \u2014 the coordinates of the $ i $ -th chess piece.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any.",

    "hint": "In the first example, you can't place the two pieces on a $ 1\\times1 $ chessboard without breaking the rule. But you can place two pieces on a $ 2\\times2 $ chessboard like this:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1173B/19a9324ad1d9f76a12004b1e06e1a6fc8ea5363a.png)\n\nIn the second example, you can't place four pieces on a $ 2\\times2 $ chessboard without breaking the rule. For example, if you place the pieces like this:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1173B/dd0c838eb5fa429a4dd839467d147e6034fac9bb.png)\n\nthen $ |r_1-r_3|+|c_1-c_3|=|1-2|+|1-1|=1 $ , $ |1-3|=2 $ , $ 1<2 $ ; and $ |r_1-r_4|+|c_1-c_4|=|1-2|+|1-2|=2 $ , $ |1-4|=3 $ , $ 2<3 $ . It doesn't satisfy the rule.\n\nHowever, on a $ 3\\times3 $ chessboard, you can place four pieces like this:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1173B/b7f6bf4dffb399263283db89988092d0fdbbac58.png)",
