    "description": "A fashion tour consists of $ m $ identical runway shows in different cities. There are $ n $ models willing to participate in the tour, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . People in different cities have different views on the fashion industry, so they rate each model differently. In particular, people in city $ i $ rate model $ j $ with rating $ r_{i, j} $ .\n\nYou are to choose some number of $ k $ models, and their order, let the chosen models have indices $ j_1, j_2, \\dots, j_k $ in the chosen order. In each city, these $ k $ models will walk the runway one after another in this order. To make the show exciting, in each city, the ratings of models should be strictly increasing in the order of their performance. More formally, for any city $ i $ and index $ t $ ( $ 2 \\leq t \\leq k $ ), the ratings must satisfy $ r_{i,j_{t - 1}} < r_{i,j_t} $ .\n\nAfter all, the fashion industry is all about money, so choosing model $ j $ to participate in the tour profits you $ p_j $ money. Compute the maximum total profit you can make by choosing the models and their order while satisfying all the requirements.",

    "hint": "In the first example, there are $ 3 $ invited models. The show consists of models in the order $ [1, 3, 4] $ .\n\nThen, the corresponding ratings in the cities are as follows:\n\n- City $ 1 $ \u2014 $ [ 1, 3, 4 ] $ .\n- City $ 2 $ \u2014 $ [ 1, 2, 3 ] $ .\n- City $ 3 $ \u2014 $ [ 2, 4, 5 ] $ .\n\nYou can see that the ratings are increasing. So the total profit is $ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 $ . It can be proven that we can't achieve a bigger profit.\n\nIn the second example, we can invite the fifth model to the tour, which would result in a total profit of $ 50 $ . It can be proven that we can't achieve a bigger profit.\n\nIn the third example, we invite the single model to the tour, which results in a total profit of $ 1\\,000\\,000\\,000 $ .\n\nIn the fourth test case, we can invite all the models and make the show in the order $ [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ] $ . The total profit is $ 5 \\cdot 1\\,000\\,000\\,000 = 5\\,000\\,000\\,000 $ ."
