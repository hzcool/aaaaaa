    "description": "Leo Jr. draws pictures in his notebook with checkered sheets (that is, each sheet has a regular square grid printed on it). We can assume that the sheets are infinitely large in any direction.\n\nTo draw a picture, Leo Jr. colors some of the cells on a sheet gray. He considers the resulting picture beautiful if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n- The picture is connected, that is, it is possible to get from any gray cell to any other by following a chain of gray cells, with each pair of adjacent cells in the path being neighbours (that is, sharing a side).\n- Each gray cell has an even number of gray neighbours.\n- There are exactly $ n $ gray cells with all gray neighbours. The number of other gray cells can be arbitrary (but reasonable, so that they can all be listed).\n\nLeo Jr. is now struggling to draw a beautiful picture with a particular choice of $ n $ . Help him, and provide any example of a beautiful picture.\n\nTo output cell coordinates in your answer, assume that the sheet is provided with a Cartesian coordinate system such that one of the cells is chosen to be the origin $ (0, 0) $ , axes $ 0x $ and $ 0y $ are orthogonal and parallel to grid lines, and a unit step along any axis in any direction takes you to a neighbouring cell.",
    "inputFormat": "The only line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 500 $ ) \u2014 the number of gray cells with all gray neighbours in a beautiful picture.",
    "outputFormat": "In the first line, print a single integer $ k $ \u2014 the number of gray cells in your picture. For technical reasons, $ k $ should not exceed $ 5 \\cdot 10^5 $ .\n\nEach of the following $ k $ lines should contain two integers \u2014 coordinates of a gray cell in your picture. All listed cells should be distinct, and the picture should satisdfy all the properties listed above. All coordinates should not exceed $ 10^9 $ by absolute value.\n\nOne can show that there exists an answer satisfying all requirements with a small enough $ k $ .",
