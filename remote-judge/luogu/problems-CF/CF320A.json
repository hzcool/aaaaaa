    "description": "A magic number is a number formed by concatenation of numbers $ 1 $ , $ 14 $ and $ 144 $ . We can use each of these numbers any number of times. Therefore $ 14144 $ , $ 141414 $ and $ 1411 $ are magic numbers but $ 1444 $ , $ 514 $ and $ 414 $ are not.\n\nYou're given a number. Determine if it is a magic number or not.",
