    "description": "It is known that there are $ k $ fish species in the polar ocean, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ k $ . They are sorted by non-decreasing order of their weight, which is a positive number. Let the weight of the $ i $ -th type of fish be $ w_{i} $ , then $ 0&lt;w_{1}<=w_{2}<=...<=w_{k} $ holds.\n\nPolar bears Alice and Bob each have caught some fish, and they are guessing who has the larger sum of weight of the fish he/she's caught. Given the type of the fish they've caught, determine whether it is possible that the fish caught by Alice has a strictly larger total weight than Bob's. In other words, does there exist a sequence of weights $ w_{i} $ (not necessary integers), such that the fish caught by Alice has a strictly larger total weight?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ n,m,k $ $ (1<=n,m<=10^{5},1<=k<=10^{9}) $ \u2014 the number of fish caught by Alice and Bob respectively, and the number of fish species.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers each from 1 to $ k $ , the list of fish type caught by Alice. The third line contains $ m $ integers each from 1 to $ k $ , the list of fish type caught by Bob.\n\nNote that one may have caught more than one fish for a same species.",

Therefore, the total weight of Bob\u2019s fish is always not less than the total weight of Alice\u2019s fish.",
