    "description": "Professor GukiZ doesn't accept string as they are. He likes to swap some letters in string to obtain a new one.\n\nGukiZ has strings $ a $ , $ b $ , and $ c $ . He wants to obtain string $ k $ by swapping some letters in $ a $ , so that $ k $ should contain as many non-overlapping substrings equal either to $ b $ or $ c $ as possible. Substring of string $ x $ is a string formed by consecutive segment of characters from $ x $ . Two substrings of string $ x $ overlap if there is position $ i $ in string $ x $ occupied by both of them.\n\nGukiZ was disappointed because none of his students managed to solve the problem. Can you help them and find one of possible strings $ k $ ?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains string $ a $ , the second line contains string $ b $ , and the third line contains string $ c $ ( $ 1<=|a|,|b|,|c|<=10^{5} $ , where $ |s| $ denotes the length of string $ s $ ).\n\nAll three strings consist only of lowercase English letters.\n\nIt is possible that $ b $ and $ c $ coincide.",
