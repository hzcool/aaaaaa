If you don't know what is the sudoku, you can read about it [here](http://tiny.cc/636xmz).\n\nThe picture showing the correct sudoku solution:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1335D/512a05a69fe045d0e0e90836d8dc5e29c119293a.png)\n\nBlocks are bordered with bold black color.\n\nYour task is to change at most $ 9 $ elements of this field (i.e. choose some $ 1 \\le i, j \\le 9 $ and change the number at the position $ (i, j) $ to any other number in range $ [1; 9] $ ) to make it anti-sudoku. The anti-sudoku is the $ 9 \\times 9 $ field, in which:\n\n- Any number in this field is in range $ [1; 9] $ ;\n- each row contains at least two equal elements;\n- each column contains at least two equal elements;\n- each $ 3 \\times 3 $ block (you can read what is the block in the link above) contains at least two equal elements.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the answer exists.\n\nYou have to answer $ t $ independent test cases.",
