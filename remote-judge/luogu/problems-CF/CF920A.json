    "description": "It is winter now, and Max decided it's about time he watered the garden.\n\nThe garden can be represented as $ n $ consecutive garden beds, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . $ k $ beds contain water taps ( $ i $ -th tap is located in the bed $ x_{i} $ ), which, if turned on, start delivering water to neighbouring beds. If the tap on the bed $ x_{i} $ is turned on, then after one second has passed, the bed $ x_{i} $ will be watered; after two seconds have passed, the beds from the segment $ [x_{i}-1,x_{i}+1] $ will be watered (if they exist); after $ j $ seconds have passed ( $ j $ is an integer number), the beds from the segment $ [x_{i}-(j-1),x_{i}+(j-1)] $ will be watered (if they exist). Nothing changes during the seconds, so, for example, we can't say that the segment $ [x_{i}-2.5,x_{i}+2.5] $ will be watered after $ 2.5 $ seconds have passed; only the segment $ [x_{i}-2,x_{i}+2] $ will be watered at that moment.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF920A/13bc7cf6794d83f150515b3ef05c019c5a177edb.png) The garden from test $ 1 $ .

White colour denotes an unwatered garden bed, blue colour \u2014 a watered bed. Max wants to turn on all the water taps at the same moment, and now he wonders, what is the minimum number of seconds that have to pass after he turns on some taps until the whole garden is watered. Help him to find the answer!",
