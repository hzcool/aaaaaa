    "description": "This winter is so cold in Nvodsk! A group of $ n $ friends decided to buy $ k $ bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has $ l $ milliliters of the drink. Also they bought $ c $ limes and cut each of them into $ d $ slices. After that they found $ p $ grams of salt.\n\nTo make a toast, each friend needs $ nl $ milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and $ np $ grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?",

    "hint": "A comment to the first sample:\n\nOverall the friends have $ 4*5=20 $ milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make $ 20/3=6 $ toasts. The limes are enough for $ 10*8=80 $ toasts and the salt is enough for $ 100/1=100 $ toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is $ min(6,80,100)/3=2 $ .",
