    "description": "The polar bears are going fishing. They plan to sail from $ (s_{x},s_{y}) $ to $ (e_{x},e_{y}) $ . However, the boat can only sail by wind. At each second, the wind blows in one of these directions: east, south, west or north. Assume the boat is currently at $ (x,y) $ .\n\n- If the wind blows to the east, the boat will move to $ (x+1,y) $ .\n- If the wind blows to the south, the boat will move to $ (x,y-1) $ .\n- If the wind blows to the west, the boat will move to $ (x-1,y) $ .\n- If the wind blows to the north, the boat will move to $ (x,y+1) $ .\n\nAlternatively, they can hold the boat by the anchor. In this case, the boat stays at $ (x,y) $ . Given the wind direction for $ t $ seconds, what is the earliest time they sail to $ (e_{x},e_{y}) $ ?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains five integers $ t,s_{x},s_{y},e_{x},e_{y} $ $ (1<=t<=10^{5},-10^{9}<=s_{x},s_{y},e_{x},e_{y}<=10^{9}) $ . The starting location and the ending location will be different.\n\nThe second line contains $ t $ characters, the $ i $ -th character is the wind blowing direction at the $ i $ -th second. It will be one of the four possibilities: \"E\" (east), \"S\" (south), \"W\" (west) and \"N\" (north).",
