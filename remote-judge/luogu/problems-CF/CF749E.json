Pick a random permutation of integers from $ 1 $ to $ k $ , $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{k} $ . All $ k! $ permutation are equiprobable.\n3. This permutation is applied to elements of the chosen segment, i.e. permutation $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{l-1},a_{l},a_{l+1},...,a_{r-1},a_{r},a_{r+1},...,a_{n} $ is transformed to $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{l-1},a_{l-1+p1},a_{l-1+p2},...,a_{l-1+pk-1},a_{l-1+pk},a_{r+1},...,a_{n} $ .\n\nInversion if a pair of elements (not necessary neighbouring) with the wrong relative order. In other words, the number of inversion is equal to the number of pairs $ (i,j) $ such that $ i&lt;j $ and $ a_{i}&gt;a_{j} $ .
