    "description": "Chilly Willy loves playing with numbers. He only knows prime numbers that are digits yet. These numbers are $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 5 $ and $ 7 $ . But Willy grew rather bored of such numbers, so he came up with a few games that were connected with them.\n\nChilly Willy wants to find the minimum number of length $ n $ , such that it is simultaneously divisible by all numbers Willy already knows ( $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 5 $ and $ 7 $ ). Help him with that.\n\nA number's length is the number of digits in its decimal representation without leading zeros.",
