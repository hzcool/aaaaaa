Rearrange (reorder) the given strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings.\n\nString $ a $ is a substring of string $ b $ if it is possible to choose several consecutive letters in $ b $ in such a way that they form $ a $ . For example, string \"for\" is contained as a substring in strings \"codeforces\", \"for\" and \"therefore\", but is not contained as a substring in strings \"four\", \"fofo\" and \"rof\".",
