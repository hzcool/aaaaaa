    "description": "There is a frog staying to the left of the string $ s = s_1 s_2 \\ldots s_n $ consisting of $ n $ characters (to be more precise, the frog initially stays at the cell $ 0 $ ). Each character of $ s $ is either 'L' or 'R'. It means that if the frog is staying at the $ i $ -th cell and the $ i $ -th character is 'L', the frog can jump only to the left. If the frog is staying at the $ i $ -th cell and the $ i $ -th character is 'R', the frog can jump only to the right. The frog can jump only to the right from the cell $ 0 $ .\n\nNote that the frog can jump into the same cell twice and can perform as many jumps as it needs.\n\nThe frog wants to reach the $ n+1 $ -th cell. The frog chooses some positive integer value $ d $ before the first jump (and cannot change it later) and jumps by no more than $ d $ cells at once. I.e. if the $ i $ -th character is 'L' then the frog can jump to any cell in a range $ [max(0, i - d); i - 1] $ , and if the $ i $ -th character is 'R' then the frog can jump to any cell in a range $ [i + 1; min(n + 1; i + d)] $ .\n\nThe frog doesn't want to jump far, so your task is to find the minimum possible value of $ d $ such that the frog can reach the cell $ n+1 $ from the cell $ 0 $ if it can jump by no more than $ d $ cells at once. It is guaranteed that it is always possible to reach $ n+1 $ from $ 0 $ .\n\nYou have to answer $ t $ independent test cases.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next $ t $ lines describe test cases. The $ i $ -th test case is described as a string $ s $ consisting of at least $ 1 $ and at most $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ characters 'L' and 'R'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ( $ \\sum |s| \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ).",
