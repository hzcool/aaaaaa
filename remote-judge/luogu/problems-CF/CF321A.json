    "description": "Fox Ciel has a robot on a 2D plane. Initially it is located in (0, 0). Fox Ciel code a command to it. The command was represented by string $ s $ . Each character of $ s $ is one move operation. There are four move operations at all:\n\n- 'U': go up, (x, y) $ \u2192 $ (x, y+1);\n- 'D': go down, (x, y) $ \u2192 $ (x, y-1);\n- 'L': go left, (x, y) $ \u2192 $ (x-1, y);\n- 'R': go right, (x, y) $ \u2192 $ (x+1, y).\n\nThe robot will do the operations in $ s $ from left to right, and repeat it infinite times. Help Fox Ciel to determine if after some steps the robot will located in $ (a,b) $ .",
