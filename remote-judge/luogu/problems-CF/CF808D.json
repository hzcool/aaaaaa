    "description": "Vasya has an array $ a $ consisting of positive integer numbers. Vasya wants to divide this array into two non-empty consecutive parts (the prefix and the suffix) so that the sum of all elements in the first part equals to the sum of elements in the second part. It is not always possible, so Vasya will move some element before dividing the array (Vasya will erase some element and insert it into an arbitrary position).\n\nInserting an element in the same position he was erased from is also considered moving.\n\nCan Vasya divide the array after choosing the right element to move and its new position?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ ) \u2014 the size of the array.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2}...\\ a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the elements of the array.",
    "outputFormat": "Print YES if Vasya can divide the array after moving one element. Otherwise print NO.",
