    "description": "Everybody in Russia uses Gregorian calendar. In this calendar there are $ 31 $ days in January, $ 28 $ or $ 29 $ days in February (depending on whether the year is leap or not), $ 31 $ days in March, $ 30 $ days in April, $ 31 $ days in May, $ 30 $ in June, $ 31 $ in July, $ 31 $ in August, $ 30 $ in September, $ 31 $ in October, $ 30 $ in November, $ 31 $ in December.\n\nA year is leap in one of two cases: either its number is divisible by $ 4 $ , but not divisible by $ 100 $ , or is divisible by $ 400 $ . For example, the following years are leap: $ 2000 $ , $ 2004 $ , but years $ 1900 $ and $ 2018 $ are not leap.\n\nIn this problem you are given $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=24 $ ) integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ , and you have to check if these integers could be durations in days of $ n $ consecutive months, according to Gregorian calendar. Note that these months could belong to several consecutive years. In other words, check if there is a month in some year, such that its duration is $ a_{1} $ days, duration of the next month is $ a_{2} $ days, and so on.",

    "outputFormat": "If there are several consecutive months that fit the sequence, print \"YES\" (without quotes). Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\nYou can print each letter in arbitrary case (small or large).",

    "hint": "In the first example the integers can denote months July, August, September and October.\n\nIn the second example the answer is no, because there are no two consecutive months each having $ 30 $ days.\n\nIn the third example the months are: February (leap year) \u2014 March \u2014 April \u2013 May \u2014 June.\n\nIn the fourth example the number of days in the second month is $ 28 $ , so this is February. March follows February and has $ 31 $ days, but not $ 30 $ , so the answer is NO.\n\nIn the fifth example the months are: December \u2014 January \u2014 February (non-leap year).",
