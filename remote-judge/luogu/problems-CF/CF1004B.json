    "description": "Sonya decided to organize an exhibition of flowers. Since the girl likes only roses and lilies, she decided that only these two kinds of flowers should be in this exhibition.\n\nThere are $ n $ flowers in a row in the exhibition. Sonya can put either a rose or a lily in the $ i $ -th position. Thus each of $ n $ positions should contain exactly one flower: a rose or a lily.\n\nShe knows that exactly $ m $ people will visit this exhibition. The $ i $ -th visitor will visit all flowers from $ l_i $ to $ r_i $ inclusive. The girl knows that each segment has its own beauty that is equal to the product of the number of roses and the number of lilies.\n\nSonya wants her exhibition to be liked by a lot of people. That is why she wants to put the flowers in such way that the sum of beauties of all segments would be maximum possible.",
