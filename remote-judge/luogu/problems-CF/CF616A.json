    "description": "You are given two very long integers $ a,b $ (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number $ a $ or $ b $ is greater or determine that they are equal.\n\nThe input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.\n\nAs input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw\\_input().",
