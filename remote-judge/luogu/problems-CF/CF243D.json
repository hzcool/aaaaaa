    "description": "One day Petya got a set of wooden cubes as a present from his mom. Petya immediately built a whole city from these cubes.\n\nThe base of the city is an $ n\u00d7n $ square, divided into unit squares. The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the square's opposite corners have coordinates $ (0,0) $ and $ (n,n) $ . On each of the unit squares Petya built a tower of wooden cubes. The side of a wooden cube also has a unit length.\n\nAfter that Petya went an infinitely large distance away from his masterpiece and looked at it in the direction of vector $ v=(v_{x},v_{y},0) $ . Petya wonders, how many distinct cubes are visible from this position. Help him, find this number.\n\nEach cube includes the border. We think that a cube is visible if there is a ray emanating from some point $ p $ , belonging to the cube, in the direction of vector $ -v $ , that doesn't contain any points, belonging to other cubes.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ v_{x} $ and $ v_{y} $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{3} $ , $ |v_{x}|,|v_{y}|<=|10^{4}| $ , $ |v_{x}|+|v_{y}|>0 $ ).\n\nNext $ n $ lines contain $ n $ integers each: the $ j $ -th integer in the $ i $ -th line $ a_{ij} $ $ (0<=a_{ij}<=10^{9} $ , $ 1<=i,j<=n) $ represents the height of the cube tower that stands on the unit square with opposite corners at points $ (i-1,j-1) $ and $ (i,j) $ .",
