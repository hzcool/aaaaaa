    "description": "There are two currencies: pebbles and beads. Initially you have $ a $ pebbles, $ b $ beads.\n\nThere are $ n $ days, each day you can exchange one currency for another at some exchange rate.\n\nOn day $ i $ , you can exchange $ -p_i \\leq x \\leq p_i $ pebbles for $ -q_i \\leq y \\leq q_i $ beads or vice versa. It's allowed not to perform an exchange at all. Meanwhile, if you perform an exchange, the proportion $ x \\cdot q_i = -y \\cdot p_i $ must be fulfilled. Fractional exchanges are allowed.\n\nYou can perform no more than one such exchange in one day. The numbers of pebbles and beads you have must always remain non-negative.\n\nPlease solve the following $ n $ problems independently: for each day $ i $ , output the maximum number of pebbles that you can have at the end of day $ i $ if you perform exchanges optimally.",

In each line there is an optimal sequence of actions for each day.\n\nIn the first test case, the optimal strategy for the first day is to do no action at all, as we can only decrease the number of pebbles. The optimal strategy for the second day is at first to exchange $ 1 $ pebble for $ 2 $ beads, which is a correct exchange, since $ 1 \\cdot 4 = 2 \\cdot 2 $ , and then to exchange $ 2 $ beads for $ 3 $ pebbles.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1735F/b39065acebbcc970390f5cd64e48697e083bee20.png)"
