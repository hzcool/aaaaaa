    "description": "Petya once wrote a sad love song and shared it to Vasya. The song is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. Vasya made up $ q $ questions about this song. Each question is about a subsegment of the song starting from the $ l $ -th letter to the $ r $ -th letter. Vasya considers a substring made up from characters on this segment and repeats each letter in the subsegment $ k $ times, where $ k $ is the index of the corresponding letter in the alphabet. For example, if the question is about the substring \"abbcb\", then Vasya repeats letter 'a' once, each of the letters 'b' twice, letter 'c\" three times, so that the resulting string is \"abbbbcccbb\", its length is $ 10 $ . Vasya is interested about the length of the resulting string.\n\nHelp Petya find the length of each string obtained by Vasya.",

Each line contains two integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n $ ) \u2014 the bounds of the question.",

In the second question Vasya considers \"baca\", that transforms to \"bbaccca\", so the answer is $ 7 $ . In the third question Vasya considers the string \"abacaba\",that transforms to \"abbacccabba\" of length $ 11 $ .",
