    "description": "Adieu l'ami.\n\nKoyomi is helping Oshino, an acquaintance of his, to take care of an open space around the abandoned Eikou Cram School building, Oshino's makeshift residence.\n\nThe space is represented by a rectangular grid of $ n\u00d7m $ cells, arranged into $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns. The $ c $ -th cell in the $ r $ -th row is denoted by $ (r,c) $ .\n\nOshino places and removes barriers around rectangular areas of cells. Specifically, an action denoted by \" $ 1\\ r_{1}\\ c_{1}\\ r_{2}\\ c_{2} $ \" means Oshino's placing barriers around a rectangle with two corners being $ (r_{1},c_{1}) $ and $ (r_{2},c_{2}) $ and sides parallel to squares sides. Similarly, \" $ 2\\ r_{1}\\ c_{1}\\ r_{2}\\ c_{2} $ \" means Oshino's removing barriers around the rectangle. Oshino ensures that no barriers staying on the ground share any common points, nor do they intersect with boundaries of the $ n\u00d7m $ area.\n\nSometimes Koyomi tries to walk from one cell to another carefully without striding over barriers, in order to avoid damaging various items on the ground. \" $ 3\\ r_{1}\\ c_{1}\\ r_{2}\\ c_{2} $ \" means that Koyomi tries to walk from $ (r_{1},c_{1}) $ to $ (r_{2},c_{2}) $ without crossing barriers.\n\nAnd you're here to tell Koyomi the feasibility of each of his attempts.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains three space-separated integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ q $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=2500 $ , $ 1<=q<=100000 $ ) \u2014 the number of rows and columns in the grid, and the total number of Oshino and Koyomi's actions, respectively.\n\nThe following $ q $ lines each describes an action, containing five space-separated integers $ t $ , $ r_{1} $ , $ c_{1} $ , $ r_{2} $ , $ c_{2} $ ( $ 1<=t<=3 $ , $ 1<=r_{1},r_{2}<=n $ , $ 1<=c_{1},c_{2}<=m $ ) \u2014 the type and two coordinates of an action. Additionally, the following holds depending on the value of $ t $ :\n\n- If $ t=1 $ : $ 2<=r_{1}<=r_{2}<=n-1 $ , $ 2<=c_{1}<=c_{2}<=m-1 $ ;\n- If $ t=2 $ : $ 2<=r_{1}<=r_{2}<=n-1 $ , $ 2<=c_{1}<=c_{2}<=m-1 $ , the specified group of barriers exist on the ground before the removal.\n- If $ t=3 $ : no extra restrictions.",
