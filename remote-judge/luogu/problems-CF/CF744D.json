    "description": "Hongcow really likes the color red. Hongcow doesn't like the color blue.\n\nHongcow is standing in an infinite field where there are $ n $ red points and $ m $ blue points.\n\nHongcow wants to draw a circle in the field such that this circle contains at least one red point, and no blue points. Points that line exactly on the boundary of the circle can be counted as either inside or outside.\n\nCompute the radius of the largest circle that satisfies this condition. If this circle can have arbitrarily large size, print $ -1 $ . Otherwise, your answer will be accepted if it has relative or absolute error at most $ 10^{-4} $ .",

This denotes the coordinates of a red point.\n\nThe next $ m $ lines will contain two integers $ x_{i},y_{i} $ ( $ 1<=x_{i},y_{i}<=10^{4} $ ).
