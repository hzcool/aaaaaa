    "description": "Highway 201 is the most busy street in Rockport. Traffic cars cause a lot of hindrances to races, especially when there are a lot of them. The track which passes through this highway can be divided into $ n $ sub-tracks. You are given an array $ a $ where $ a_i $ represents the number of traffic cars in the $ i $ -th sub-track. You define the inconvenience of the track as $ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} \\sum\\limits_{j=i+1}^{n} \\lvert a_i-a_j\\rvert $ , where $ |x| $ is the absolute value of $ x $ .\n\nYou can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times: choose a traffic car and move it from its current sub-track to any other sub-track.\n\nFind the minimum inconvenience you can achieve.",
