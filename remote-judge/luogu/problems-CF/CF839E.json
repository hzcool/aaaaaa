    "description": "There are $ n $ castles in the Lannister's Kingdom and some walls connect two castles, no two castles are connected by more than one wall, no wall connects a castle to itself.\n\nSir Jaime Lannister has discovered that Daenerys Targaryen is going to attack his kingdom soon. Therefore he wants to defend his kingdom. He has $ k $ liters of a strange liquid. He wants to distribute that liquid among the castles, so each castle may contain some liquid (possibly zero or non-integer number of liters). After that the stability of a wall is defined as follows: if the wall connects two castles $ a $ and $ b $ , and they contain $ x $ and $ y $ liters of that liquid, respectively, then the strength of that wall is $ x\u00b7y $ .\n\nYour task is to print the maximum possible sum of stabilities of the walls that Sir Jaime Lannister can achieve.",
