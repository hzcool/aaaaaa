    "description": "Polycarp remembered the $ 2020 $ -th year, and he is happy with the arrival of the new $ 2021 $ -th year. To remember such a wonderful moment, Polycarp wants to represent the number $ n $ as the sum of a certain number of $ 2020 $ and a certain number of $ 2021 $ .\n\nFor example, if:\n\n- $ n=4041 $ , then the number $ n $ can be represented as the sum $ 2020 + 2021 $ ;\n- $ n=4042 $ , then the number $ n $ can be represented as the sum $ 2021 + 2021 $ ;\n- $ n=8081 $ , then the number $ n $ can be represented as the sum $ 2020 + 2020 + 2020 + 2021 $ ;\n- $ n=8079 $ , then the number $ n $ cannot be represented as the sum of the numbers $ 2020 $ and $ 2021 $ .\n\nHelp Polycarp to find out whether the number $ n $ can be represented as the sum of a certain number of numbers $ 2020 $ and a certain number of numbers $ 2021 $ .",

    "outputFormat": "For each test case, output on a separate line:\n\n- \"YES\" if the number $ n $ is representable as the sum of a certain number of $ 2020 $ and a certain number of $ 2021 $ ;\n- \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).",
