In other words, these cities and roads form a tree.\n\nThere are $ m $ bus routes connecting the cities together. A bus route between city $ x $ and city $ y $ allows you to travel between any two cities in the simple path between $ x $ and $ y $ with this route.\n\nDetermine if for every pair of cities $ u $ and $ v $ , you can travel from $ u $ to $ v $ using at most two bus routes.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ).
