    "description": "Ujan has a lot of useless stuff in his drawers, a considerable part of which are his math notebooks: it is time to sort them out. This time he found an old dusty graph theory notebook with a description of a graph.\n\nIt is an undirected weighted graph on $ n $ vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either $ 0 $ or $ 1 $ ; exactly $ m $ edges have weight $ 1 $ , and all others have weight $ 0 $ .\n\nSince Ujan doesn't really want to organize his notes, he decided to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you find the answer for Ujan so he stops procrastinating?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $ , $ 0 \\leq m \\leq \\min(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2},10^5) $ ), the number of vertices and the number of edges of weight $ 1 $ in the graph.\n\nThe $ i $ -th of the next $ m $ lines contains two integers $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ ( $ 1 \\leq a_i, b_i \\leq n $ , $ a_i \\neq b_i $ ), the endpoints of the $ i $ -th edge of weight $ 1 $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that no edge appears twice in the input.",
