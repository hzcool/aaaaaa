    "description": "As you might remember from our previous rounds, Vova really likes computer games. Now he is playing a strategy game known as Rage of Empires.\n\nIn the game Vova can hire $ n $ different warriors; $ i $ th warrior has the type $ a_{i} $ . Vova wants to create a balanced army hiring some subset of warriors. An army is called balanced if for each type of warrior present in the game there are not more than $ k $ warriors of this type in the army. Of course, Vova wants his army to be as large as possible.\n\nTo make things more complicated, Vova has to consider $ q $ different plans of creating his army. $ i $ th plan allows him to hire only warriors whose numbers are not less than $ l_{i} $ and not greater than $ r_{i} $ .\n\nHelp Vova to determine the largest size of a balanced army for each plan.\n\nBe aware that the plans are given in a modified way. See input section for details.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,k<=100000 $ ).\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1} $ , $ a_{2} $ , ... $ a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=100000 $ ).\n\nThe third line contains one integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=100000 $ ).\n\nThen $ q $ lines follow. $ i $ th line contains two numbers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ which represent $ i $ th plan ( $ 1<=x_{i},y_{i}<=n $ ).\n\nYou have to keep track of the answer to the last plan (let's call it $ last $ ). In the beginning $ last=0 $ . Then to restore values of $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ for the $ i $ th plan, you have to do the following:\n\n1. $ l_{i}=((x_{i}+last)\u00a0mod\u00a0n)+1 $ ;\n2. $ r_{i}=((y_{i}+last)\u00a0mod\u00a0n)+1 $ ;\n3. If $ l_{i}>r_{i} $ , swap $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ .",
