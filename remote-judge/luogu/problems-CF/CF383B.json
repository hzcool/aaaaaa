    "description": "Iahub got lost in a very big desert. The desert can be represented as a $ n\u00d7n $ square matrix, where each cell is a zone of the desert. The cell $ (i,j) $ represents the cell at row $ i $ and column $ j $ $ (1<=i,j<=n) $ . Iahub can go from one cell $ (i,j) $ only down or right, that is to cells $ (i+1,j) $ or $ (i,j+1) $ .\n\nAlso, there are $ m $ cells that are occupied by volcanoes, which Iahub cannot enter.\n\nIahub is initially at cell $ (1,1) $ and he needs to travel to cell $ (n,n) $ . Knowing that Iahub needs $ 1 $ second to travel from one cell to another, find the minimum time in which he can arrive in cell $ (n,n) $ .",

Each of the next $ m $ lines contains a pair of integers, $ x $ and $ y $ $ (1<=x,y<=n) $ , representing the coordinates of the volcanoes.\n\nConsider matrix rows are numbered from 1 to $ n $ from top to bottom, and matrix columns are numbered from 1 to $ n $ from left to right. There is no volcano in cell $ (1,1) $ . No two volcanoes occupy the same location.",
