    "description": "Limak is an old brown bear. He often plays poker with his friends. Today they went to a casino. There are $ n $ players (including Limak himself) and right now all of them have bids on the table. $ i $ -th of them has bid with size $ a_{i} $ dollars.\n\nEach player can double his bid any number of times and triple his bid any number of times. The casino has a great jackpot for making all bids equal. Is it possible that Limak and his friends will win a jackpot?",
    "inputFormat": "First line of input contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5} $ ), the number of players.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integer numbers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the bids of players.",
