    "description": "Arkady owns a non-decreasing array $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ . You are jealous of its beauty and want to destroy this property. You have a so-called XOR-gun that you can use one or more times.\n\nIn one step you can select two consecutive elements of the array, let's say $ x $ and $ y $ , remove them from the array and insert the integer $ x \\oplus y $ on their place, where $ \\oplus $ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR). Note that the length of the array decreases by one after the operation. You can't perform this operation when the length of the array reaches one.\n\nFor example, if the array is $ [2, 5, 6, 8] $ , you can select $ 5 $ and $ 6 $ and replace them with $ 5 \\oplus 6 = 3 $ . The array becomes $ [2, 3, 8] $ .\n\nYou want the array no longer be non-decreasing. What is the minimum number of steps needed? If the array stays non-decreasing no matter what you do, print $ -1 $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the initial length of the array.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that $ a_i \\le a_{i + 1} $ for all $ 1 \\le i < n $ .",

Then you can, for example, select $ 3 $ and $ 4 $ and the array becomes $ [7, 6, 20] $ , which is no longer non-decreasing.",
