    "description": "Ashishgup and FastestFinger play a game.\n\nThey start with a number $ n $ and play in turns. In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:\n\n- Divide $ n $ by any of its odd divisors greater than $ 1 $ .\n- Subtract $ 1 $ from $ n $ if $ n $ is greater than $ 1 $ .\n\nDivisors of a number include the number itself.\n\nThe player who is unable to make a move loses the game.\n\nAshishgup moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.",
