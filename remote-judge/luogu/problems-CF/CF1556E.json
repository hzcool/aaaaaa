Formally, the values are equalized if for each $ i $ from $ l $ to $ r $ holds $ a_i = b_i $ .\n\nTo perform a balancing operation an even number of indices must be selected, such that $ l \\le pos_1 < pos_2 < \\dots < pos_k \\le r $ . Next the items of array a at positions $ pos_1, pos_3, pos_5, \\dots $ get incremented by one and the items of array b at positions $ pos_2, pos_4, pos_6, \\dots $ get incremented by one.\n\nWilliam wants to find out if it is possible to equalize the values of elements in two arrays for each segment using some number of balancing operations, and what is the minimal number of operations required for that. Note that for each segment the operations are performed independently.",
