    "description": "All of us know that girls in Arpa\u2019s land are... ok, you\u2019ve got the idea :D\n\nAnyone knows that Arpa isn't a normal man, he is ... well, sorry, I can't explain it more. Mehrdad is interested about the reason, so he asked Sipa, one of the best biology scientists in Arpa's land, for help. Sipa has a DNA editor.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF741E/f1c979b8a7bb7c441f45ba8aff5ff742219a18d6.png)Sipa put Arpa under the DNA editor. DNA editor showed Arpa's DNA as a string $ S $ consisting of $ n $ lowercase English letters. Also Sipa has another DNA $ T $ consisting of lowercase English letters that belongs to a normal man.\n\nNow there are $ (n+1) $ options to change Arpa's DNA, numbered from $ 0 $ to $ n $ . $ i $ -th of them is to put $ T $ between $ i $ -th and $ (i+1) $ -th characters of $ S $ ( $ 0<=i<=n $ ). If $ i=0 $ , $ T $ will be put before $ S $ , and if $ i=n $ , it will be put after $ S $ .\n\nMehrdad wants to choose the most interesting option for Arpa's DNA among these $ n+1 $ options. DNA $ A $ is more interesting than $ B $ if $ A $ is lexicographically smaller than $ B $ . Mehrdad asked Sipa $ q $ questions:\n\nGiven integers $ l,r,k,x,y $ , what is the most interesting option if we only consider such options $ i $ that $ l<=i<=r $ and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF741E/efffa8af9d832e95e5a4f5bfacc794d15b67b9f5.png)? If there are several most interesting options, Mehrdad wants to know one with the smallest number $ i $ .\n\nSince Sipa is a biology scientist but not a programmer, you should help him.",

The strings $ S $ and $ T $ consist only of small English letters.\n\nNext $ q $ lines describe the Mehrdad's questions.
