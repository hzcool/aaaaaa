Also, the $ i $ -th person needs $ t_i $ minutes to get dressed, so in total he or she needs $ t_i + |x_i - x_0| $ minutes.\n\nHere $ |y| $ denotes the absolute value of $ y $ .\n\nThese people ask you to find a position $ x_0 $ that minimizes the time in which all $ n $ people can gather at the meeting place.",
