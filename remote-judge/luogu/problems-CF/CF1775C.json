    "description": "Petya and his friend, robot Petya++, like to solve exciting math problems.\n\nOne day Petya++ came up with the numbers $ n $ and $ x $ and wrote the following equality on the board: $ $$$n\\ \\&\\ (n+1)\\ \\&\\ \\dots\\ \\&\\ m = x, $ $  where  $ \\\\&amp; $  denotes the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND\">bitwise AND operation</a>. Then he suggested his friend Petya find such a minimal  $ m $  ( $ m \\\\ge n$$$) that the equality on the board holds.\n\nUnfortunately, Petya couldn't solve this problem in his head and decided to ask for computer help. He quickly wrote a program and found the answer.\n\nCan you solve this difficult problem?\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1775C/3708862555546ebb5c352c2d2207eacbd490398b.png)",

    "outputFormat": "For every test case, output the smallest possible value of $ m $ such that equality holds.\n\nIf the equality does not hold for any $ m $ , print $ -1 $ instead.\n\nWe can show that if the required $ m $ exists, it does not exceed $ 5 \\cdot 10^{18} $ .",
