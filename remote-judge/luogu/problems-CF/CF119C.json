    "description": "Yet another education system reform has been carried out in Berland recently. The innovations are as follows:\n\nAn academic year now consists of $ n $ days. Each day pupils study exactly one of $ m $ subjects, besides, each subject is studied for no more than one day. After the lessons of the $ i $ -th subject pupils get the home task that contains no less than $ a_{i} $ and no more than $ b_{i} $ exercises. Besides, each subject has a special attribute, the complexity ( $ c_{i} $ ). A school can make its own timetable, considering the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n- the timetable should contain the subjects in the order of the complexity's strict increasing;\n- each day, except for the first one, the task should contain either $ k $ times more exercises, or more by $ k $ compared to the previous day (more formally: let's call the number of home task exercises in the $ i $ -th day as $ x_{i} $ , then for each $ i $ ( $ 1&lt;i<=n $ ): either $ x_{i}=k+x_{i-1} $ or $ x_{i}=k\u00b7x_{i-1} $ must be true);\n- the total number of exercises in all home tasks should be maximal possible.\n\nAll limitations are separately set for each school.\n\nIt turned out that in many cases $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ reach $ 10^{16} $ (however, as the Berland Minister of Education is famous for his love to half-measures, the value of $ b_{i}-a_{i} $ doesn't exceed $ 100 $ ). That also happened in the Berland School \u2116256. Nevertheless, you as the school's principal still have to work out the timetable for the next academic year...",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=m<=50 $ , $ 1<=k<=100 $ ) which represent the number of days in an academic year, the number of subjects and the $ k $ parameter correspondingly. Each of the following $ m $ lines contains the description of a subject as three integers $ a_{i} $ , $ b_{i} $ , $ c_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=b_{i}<=10^{16} $ , $ b_{i}-a_{i}<=100 $ , $ 1<=c_{i}<=100 $ ) \u2014 two limitations to the number of exercises on the $ i $ -th subject and the complexity of the $ i $ -th subject, correspondingly. Distinct subjects can have the same complexity. The subjects are numbered with integers from $ 1 $ to $ m $ .\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit numbers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin stream or the %I64d specificator.",
    "outputFormat": "If no valid solution exists, print the single word \"NO\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, the first line should contain the word \"YES\" (without the quotes) and the next $ n $ lines should contain any timetable that satisfies all the conditions. The $ i+1 $ -th line should contain two positive integers: the number of the subject to study on the $ i $ -th day and the number of home task exercises given for this subject. The timetable should contain exactly $ n $ subjects.",
