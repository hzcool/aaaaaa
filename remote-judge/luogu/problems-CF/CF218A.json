    "description": "Little Bolek has found a picture with $ n $ mountain peaks painted on it. The $ n $ painted peaks are represented by a non-closed polyline, consisting of $ 2n $ segments. The segments go through $ 2n+1 $ points with coordinates $ (1,y_{1}) $ , $ (2,y_{2}) $ , $ ... $ , $ (2n+1,y_{2n+1}) $ , with the $ i $ -th segment connecting the point $ (i,y_{i}) $ and the point $ (i+1,y_{i+1}) $ . For any even $ i $ $ (2<=i<=2n) $ the following condition holds: $ y_{i-1}&lt;y_{i} $ and $ y_{i}&gt;y_{i+1} $ .\n\nWe shall call a vertex of a polyline with an even $ x $ coordinate a mountain peak.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF218A/96f9e39adc23f097d41530b53dba00529f48c7bd.png) The figure to the left shows the initial picture, the figure to the right shows what the picture looks like after Bolek's actions. The affected peaks are marked red, $ k $ = 2. Bolek fancied a little mischief. He chose exactly $ k $ mountain peaks, rubbed out the segments that went through those peaks and increased each peak's height by one (that is, he increased the $ y $ coordinate of the corresponding points). Then he painted the missing segments to get a new picture of mountain peaks. Let us denote the points through which the new polyline passes on Bolek's new picture as $ (1,r_{1}) $ , $ (2,r_{2}) $ , $ ... $ , $ (2n+1,r_{2n+1}) $ .\n\nGiven Bolek's final picture, restore the initial one.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ k $ $ (1<=k<=n<=100) $ . The next line contains $ 2n+1 $ space-separated integers $ r_{1},r_{2},...,r_{2n+1} $ $ (0<=r_{i}<=100) $ \u2014 the $ y $ coordinates of the polyline vertices on Bolek's picture.\n\nIt is guaranteed that we can obtain the given picture after performing the described actions on some picture of mountain peaks.",
