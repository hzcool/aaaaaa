    "description": "Boris really likes numbers and even owns a small shop selling interesting numbers. He has $ n $ decimal numbers $ B_{i} $ . Cost of the number in his shop is equal to the sum of costs of its digits. You are given the values $ c_{d} $ , where $ c_{d} $ is the cost of the digit $ d $ . Of course, Boris is interested in that numbers he owns have the maximum cost possible.\n\nRecently Boris got hold of the magical artifact $ A $ , which can allow him to increase the cost of his collection. Artifact is a string, consisting of digits and '?' symbols. To use the artifact, Boris must replace all '?' with digits to get a decimal number without leading zeros (it is also not allowed to get number 0). After that, the resulting number is added to all numbers $ B_{i} $ in Boris' collection. He uses the artifact exactly once.\n\nWhat is the maximum cost of the collection Boris can achieve after using the artifact?",
    "inputFormat": "First line contains artifact $ A $ , consisting of digits '0'\u2013'9' and '?' symbols ( $ 1<=|A|<=1000 $ ). Next line contains $ n $ \u2014 the amount of numbers in Boris' collection ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ ). Next $ n $ lines contain integers $ B_{i} $ ( $ 1<=B_{i}&lt;10^{1000} $ ). $ A $ doesn't start with '0'.\n\nLast line contains ten integers \u2014 costs of digits $ c_{0},c_{1},...,c_{9} $ ( $ 0<=c_{i}<=1000 $ ).",
