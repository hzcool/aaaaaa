    "description": "After watching a certain anime before going to sleep, Mark dreams of standing in an old classroom with a blackboard that has a sequence of $ n $ positive integers $ a_1, a_2,\\dots,a_n $ on it.\n\nThen, professor Koro comes in. He can perform the following operation:\n\n- select an integer $ x $ that appears at least $ 2 $ times on the board,\n- erase those $ 2 $ appearances, and\n- write $ x+1 $ on the board.\n\nProfessor Koro then asks Mark the question, \"what is the maximum possible number that could appear on the board after some operations?\"\n\nMark quickly solves this question, but he is still slower than professor Koro. Thus, professor Koro decides to give Mark additional challenges. He will update the initial sequence of integers $ q $ times. Each time, he will choose positive integers $ k $ and $ l $ , then change $ a_k $ to $ l $ . After each update, he will ask Mark the same question again.\n\nHelp Mark answer these questions faster than Professor Koro!\n\nNote that the updates are persistent. Changes made to the sequence $ a $ will apply when processing future updates.",
