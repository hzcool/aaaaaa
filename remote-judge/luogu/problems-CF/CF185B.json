    "description": "As you very well know, the whole Universe traditionally uses three-dimensional Cartesian system of coordinates. In this system each point corresponds to three real coordinates $ (x,y,z) $ . In this coordinate system, the distance between the center of the Universe and the point is calculated by the following formula: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF185B/19a510fc1d19a415f46c3e3ff454cf87815504ab.png). Mushroom scientists that work for the Great Mushroom King think that the Universe isn't exactly right and the distance from the center of the Universe to a point equals $ x^{a}\u00b7y^{b}\u00b7z^{c} $ .\n\nTo test the metric of mushroom scientists, the usual scientists offered them a task: find such $ x,y,z $ $ (0<=x,y,z;\u00a0x+y+z<=S) $ , that the distance between the center of the Universe and the point $ (x,y,z) $ is maximum possible in the metric of mushroom scientists. The mushroom scientists aren't good at maths, so they commissioned you to do the task.\n\nNote that in this problem, it is considered that $ 0^{0}=1 $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ S $ $ (1<=S<=10^{3}) $ \u2014 the maximum sum of coordinates of the sought point.\n\nThe second line contains three space-separated integers $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ $ (0<=a,b,c<=10^{3}) $ \u2014 the numbers that describe the metric of mushroom scientists.",
    "outputFormat": "Print three real numbers \u2014 the coordinates of the point that reaches maximum value in the metrics of mushroom scientists. If there are multiple answers, print any of them that meets the limitations.\n\nA natural logarithm of distance from the center of the Universe to the given point in the metric of mushroom scientists shouldn't differ from the natural logarithm of the maximum distance by more than $ 10^{-6} $ . We think that $ ln(0)=-\u221e $ .",
