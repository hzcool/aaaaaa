    "description": "You are given a convex polygon $ P $ with $ n $ distinct vertices $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ . Vertex $ p_{i} $ has coordinates $ (x_{i},y_{i}) $ in the 2D plane. These vertices are listed in clockwise order.\n\nYou can choose a real number $ D $ and move each vertex of the polygon a distance of at most $ D $ from their original positions.\n\nFind the maximum value of $ D $ such that no matter how you move the vertices, the polygon does not intersect itself and stays convex.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line has one integer $ n $ ( $ 4<=n<=1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices.\n\nThe next $ n $ lines contain the coordinates of the vertices. Line $ i $ contains two integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=x_{i},y_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the coordinates of the $ i $ -th vertex. These points are guaranteed to be given in clockwise order, and will form a strictly convex polygon (in particular, no three consecutive points lie on the same straight line).",
