    "description": "There are $ n $ piranhas with sizes $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ in the aquarium. Piranhas are numbered from left to right in order they live in the aquarium.\n\nScientists of the Berland State University want to find if there is dominant piranha in the aquarium. The piranha is called dominant if it can eat all the other piranhas in the aquarium (except itself, of course). Other piranhas will do nothing while the dominant piranha will eat them.\n\nBecause the aquarium is pretty narrow and long, the piranha can eat only one of the adjacent piranhas during one move. Piranha can do as many moves as it needs (or as it can). More precisely:\n\n- The piranha $ i $ can eat the piranha $ i-1 $ if the piranha $ i-1 $ exists and $ a_{i - 1} < a_i $ .\n- The piranha $ i $ can eat the piranha $ i+1 $ if the piranha $ i+1 $ exists and $ a_{i + 1} < a_i $ .\n\nWhen the piranha $ i $ eats some piranha, its size increases by one ( $ a_i $ becomes $ a_i + 1 $ ).\n\nYour task is to find any dominant piranha in the aquarium or determine if there are no such piranhas.\n\nNote that you have to find any (exactly one) dominant piranha, you don't have to find all of them.\n\nFor example, if $ a = [5, 3, 4, 4, 5] $ , then the third piranha can be dominant. Consider the sequence of its moves:\n\n- The piranha eats the second piranha and $ a $ becomes $ [5, \\underline{5}, 4, 5] $ (the underlined piranha is our candidate).\n- The piranha eats the third piranha and $ a $ becomes $ [5, \\underline{6}, 5] $ .\n- The piranha eats the first piranha and $ a $ becomes $ [\\underline{7}, 5] $ .\n- The piranha eats the second piranha and $ a $ becomes $ [\\underline{8}] $ .\n\nYou have to answer $ t $ independent test cases.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of piranhas in the aquarium. The second line of the test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ), where $ a_i $ is the size of the $ i $ -th piranha.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ does not exceed $ 3 \\cdot 10^5 $ ( $ \\sum n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5 $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the answer: -1 if there are no dominant piranhas in the aquarium or index of any dominant piranha otherwise. If there are several answers, you can print any.",
