    "description": "Monocarp has forgotten the password to his mobile phone. The password consists of $ 4 $ digits from $ 0 $ to $ 9 $ (note that it can start with the digit $ 0 $ ).\n\nMonocarp remembers that his password had exactly two different digits, and each of these digits appeared exactly two times in the password. Monocarp also remembers some digits which were definitely not used in the password.\n\nYou have to calculate the number of different sequences of $ 4 $ digits that could be the password for Monocarp's mobile phone (i. e. these sequences should meet all constraints on Monocarp's password).",
