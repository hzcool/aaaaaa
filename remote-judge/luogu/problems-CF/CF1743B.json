    "description": "You are given an integer $ n $ . You have to construct a permutation of size $ n $ .\n\nA permutation is an array where each integer from $ 1 $ to $ s $ (where $ s $ is the size of permutation) occurs exactly once. For example, $ [2, 1, 4, 3] $ is a permutation of size $ 4 $ ; $ [1, 2, 4, 5, 3] $ is a permutation of size $ 5 $ ; $ [1, 4, 3] $ is not a permutation (the integer $ 2 $ is absent), $ [2, 1, 3, 1] $ is not a permutation (the integer $ 1 $ appears twice).\n\nA subsegment of a permutation is a contiguous subsequence of that permutation. For example, the permutation $ [2, 1, 4, 3] $ has $ 10 $ subsegments: $ [2] $ , $ [2, 1] $ , $ [2, 1, 4] $ , $ [2, 1, 4, 3] $ , $ [1] $ , $ [1, 4] $ , $ [1, 4, 3] $ , $ [4] $ , $ [4, 3] $ and $ [3] $ .\n\nThe value of the permutation is the number of its subsegments which are also permutations. For example, the value of $ [2, 1, 4, 3] $ is $ 3 $ since the subsegments $ [2, 1] $ , $ [1] $ and $ [2, 1, 4, 3] $ are permutations.\n\nYou have to construct a permutation of size $ n $ with minimum possible value among all permutations of size $ n $ .",
