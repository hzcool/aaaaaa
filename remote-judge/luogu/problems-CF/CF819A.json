    "description": "Sometimes Mister B has free evenings when he doesn't know what to do. Fortunately, Mister B found a new game, where the player can play against aliens.\n\nAll characters in this game are lowercase English letters. There are two players: Mister B and his competitor.\n\nInitially the players have a string $ s $ consisting of the first $ a $ English letters in alphabetical order (for example, if $ a=5 $ , then $ s $ equals to \"abcde\").\n\nThe players take turns appending letters to string $ s $ . Mister B moves first.\n\nMister B must append exactly $ b $ letters on each his move. He can arbitrary choose these letters. His opponent adds exactly $ a $ letters on each move.\n\nMister B quickly understood that his opponent was just a computer that used a simple algorithm. The computer on each turn considers the suffix of string $ s $ of length $ a $ and generates a string $ t $ of length $ a $ such that all letters in the string $ t $ are distinct and don't appear in the considered suffix. From multiple variants of $ t $ lexicographically minimal is chosen (if $ a=4 $ and the suffix is \"bfdd\", the computer chooses string $ t $ equal to \"aceg\"). After that the chosen string $ t $ is appended to the end of $ s $ .\n\nMister B soon found the game boring and came up with the following question: what can be the minimum possible number of different letters in string $ s $ on the segment between positions $ l $ and $ r $ , inclusive. Letters of string $ s $ are numerated starting from $ 1 $ .",
