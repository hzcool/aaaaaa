    "description": "Luke likes to eat. There are $ n $ piles of food aligned in a straight line in front of him. The $ i $ -th pile contains $ a_i $ units of food.\n\nLuke will walk from the $ 1 $ -st pile towards the $ n $ -th pile, and he wants to eat every pile of food without walking back. When Luke reaches the $ i $ -th pile, he can eat that pile if and only if $ |v - a_i| \\leq x $ , where $ x $ is a fixed integer, and $ v $ is Luke's food affinity.\n\nBefore Luke starts to walk, he can set $ v $ to any integer. Also, for each $ i $ ( $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n $ ), Luke can change his food affinity to any integer before he eats the $ i $ -th pile.\n\nFind the minimum number of changes needed to eat every pile of food.\n\nNote that the initial choice for $ v $ is not considered as a change.",
