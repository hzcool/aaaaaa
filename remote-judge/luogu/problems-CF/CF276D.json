Let's consider the values of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF276D/e4d673f94fffa65030d2edd227a746e3a121dade.png) for all pairs of integers $ a $ and $ b $ $ (l<=a<=b<=r) $ . Your task is to find the maximum value among all considered ones.\n\nExpression ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF276D/a0b0fe9e9428287337c0277ea02ca07fcf0a01a7.png) means applying bitwise excluding or operation to integers $ x $ and $ y $ .
