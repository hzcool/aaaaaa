    "description": "The Fair Nut lives in $ n $ story house. $ a_i $ people live on the $ i $ -th floor of the house. Every person uses elevator twice a day: to get from the floor where he/she lives to the ground (first) floor and to get from the first floor to the floor where he/she lives, when he/she comes back home in the evening.\n\nIt was decided that elevator, when it is not used, will stay on the $ x $ -th floor, but $ x $ hasn't been chosen yet. When a person needs to get from floor $ a $ to floor $ b $ , elevator follows the simple algorithm:\n\n- Moves from the $ x $ -th floor (initially it stays on the $ x $ -th floor) to the $ a $ -th and takes the passenger.\n- Moves from the $ a $ -th floor to the $ b $ -th floor and lets out the passenger (if $ a $ equals $ b $ , elevator just opens and closes the doors, but still comes to the floor from the $ x $ -th floor).\n- Moves from the $ b $ -th floor back to the $ x $ -th.\n\n The elevator never transposes more than one person and always goes back to the floor $ x $ before transposing a next passenger. The elevator spends one unit of electricity to move between neighboring floors. So moving from the $ a $ -th floor to the $ b $ -th floor requires $ |a - b| $ units of electricity.Your task is to help Nut to find the minimum number of electricity units, that it would be enough for one day, by choosing an optimal the $ x $ -th floor. Don't forget than elevator initially stays on the $ x $ -th floor.",

    "hint": "In the first example, the answer can be achieved by choosing the second floor as the $ x $ -th floor. Each person from the second floor (there are two of them) would spend $ 4 $ units of electricity per day ( $ 2 $ to get down and $ 2 $ to get up), and one person from the third would spend $ 8 $ units of electricity per day ( $ 4 $ to get down and $ 4 $ to get up). $ 4 \\cdot 2 + 8 \\cdot 1 = 16 $ .\n\nIn the second example, the answer can be achieved by choosing the first floor as the $ x $ -th floor.",
