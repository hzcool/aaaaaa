For this purpose he draws a table in which columns correspond to weeks (a week is seven consequent days from Monday to Sunday), rows correspond to weekdays, and cells contain dates. For example, a calendar for January 2017 should look like on the picture:\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF760A/70f7bb298739f0018d24699e43e0bdba58d6965c.png)Petr wants to know how many columns his table should have given the month and the weekday of the first date of that month?
