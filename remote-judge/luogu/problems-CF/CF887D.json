    "description": "There are two main kinds of events in the life of top-model: fashion shows and photo shoots. Participating in any of these events affects the rating of appropriate top-model. After each photo shoot model's rating increases by $ a $ and after each fashion show decreases by $ b $ (designers do too many experiments nowadays). Moreover, sometimes top-models participates in talk shows. After participating in talk show model becomes more popular and increasing of her rating after photo shoots become $ c $ and decreasing of her rating after fashion show becomes $ d $ .\n\nIzabella wants to participate in a talk show, but she wants to do it in such a way that her rating will never become negative. Help her to find a suitable moment for participating in the talk show.\n\nLet's assume that model's career begins in moment 0. At that moment Izabella's rating was equal to $ start $ . If talk show happens in moment $ t $ if will affect all events in model's life in interval of time $ [t..t+len) $ (including $ t $ and not including $ t+len $ ), where $ len $ is duration of influence.\n\nIzabella wants to participate in a talk show, but she wants to do it in such a way that her rating will not become become negative before talk show or during period of influence of talk show. Help her to find a suitable moment for participating in the talk show.",

Each of those lines contains two integers $ t_{i} $ and $ q_{i} $ ( $ 1<=t_{i}<=10^{9} $ , $ 0<=q<=1 $ ) \u2014 moment, in which event happens and type of this event. Type 0 corresponds to the fashion show and type 1 \u2014 to photo shoot.\n\nEvents are given in order of increasing $ t_{i} $ , all $ t_{i} $ are different.",
