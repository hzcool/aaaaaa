    "description": "$ n $ people gathered to hold a jury meeting of the upcoming competition, the $ i $ -th member of the jury came up with $ a_i $ tasks, which they want to share with each other.\n\nFirst, the jury decides on the order which they will follow while describing the tasks. Let that be a permutation $ p $ of numbers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ (an array of size $ n $ where each integer from $ 1 $ to $ n $ occurs exactly once).\n\nThen the discussion goes as follows:\n\n- If a jury member $ p_1 $ has some tasks left to tell, then they tell one task to others. Otherwise, they are skipped.\n- If a jury member $ p_2 $ has some tasks left to tell, then they tell one task to others. Otherwise, they are skipped.\n- ...\n- If a jury member $ p_n $ has some tasks left to tell, then they tell one task to others. Otherwise, they are skipped.\n- If there are still members with tasks left, then the process repeats from the start. Otherwise, the discussion ends.\n\nA permutation $ p $ is nice if none of the jury members tell two or more of their own tasks in a row.\n\nCount the number of nice permutations. The answer may be really large, so print it modulo $ 998\\,244\\,353 $ .",

For $ p = [1, 2] $ , the process is the following:\n\n1. the first jury member tells a task;\n2. the second jury member tells a task;\n3. the first jury member doesn't have any tasks left to tell, so they are skipped;\n4. the second jury member tells a task.\n\nSo, the second jury member has told two tasks in a row (in succession), so the permutation is not nice.\n\nFor $ p = [2, 1] $ , the process is the following:\n\n1. the second jury member tells a task;\n2. the first jury member tells a task;\n3. the second jury member tells a task.\n\nSo, this permutation is nice.",
