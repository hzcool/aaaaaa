    "description": "Lesha plays the recently published new version of the legendary game hacknet. In this version character skill mechanism was introduced. Now, each player character has exactly $ n $ skills. Each skill is represented by a non-negative integer $ a_{i} $ \u2014 the current skill level. All skills have the same maximum level $ A $ .\n\nAlong with the skills, global ranking of all players was added. Players are ranked according to the so-called Force. The Force of a player is the sum of the following values:\n\n- The number of skills that a character has perfected (i.e., such that $ a_{i}=A $ ), multiplied by coefficient $ c_{f} $ .\n- The minimum skill level among all skills ( $ min\\ a_{i} $ ), multiplied by coefficient $ c_{m} $ .\n\nNow Lesha has $ m $ hacknetian currency units, which he is willing to spend. Each currency unit can increase the current level of any skill by $ 1 $ (if it's not equal to $ A $ yet). Help him spend his money in order to achieve the maximum possible value of the Force.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers $ n $ , $ A $ , $ c_{f} $ , $ c_{m} $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ , $ 1<=A<=10^{9} $ , $ 0<=c_{f},c_{m}<=1000 $ , $ 0<=m<=10^{15} $ ).\n\nThe second line contains exactly $ n $ integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=A $ ), separated by spaces, \u2014 the current levels of skills.",
    "outputFormat": "On the first line print the maximum value of the Force that the character can achieve using no more than $ m $ currency units.\n\nOn the second line print $ n $ integers $ a'_{i} $ ( $ a_{i}<=a'_{i}<=A $ ), skill levels which one must achieve in order to reach the specified value of the Force, while using no more than $ m $ currency units. Numbers should be separated by spaces.",
