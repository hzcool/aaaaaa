    "description": "Little penguin Polo adores strings. But most of all he adores strings of length $ n $ .\n\nOne day he wanted to find a string that meets the following conditions:\n\n1. The string consists of $ n $ lowercase English letters (that is, the string's length equals $ n $ ), exactly $ k $ of these letters are distinct.\n2. No two neighbouring letters of a string coincide; that is, if we represent a string as $ s=s_{1}s_{2}...\\ s_{n} $ , then the following inequality holds, $ s_{i}\u2260s_{i+1}(1<=i&lt;n) $ .\n3. Among all strings that meet points 1 and 2, the required string is lexicographically smallest.\n\nHelp him find such string or state that such string doesn't exist.\n\nString $ x=x_{1}x_{2}...\\ x_{p} $ is lexicographically less than string $ y=y_{1}y_{2}...\\ y_{q} $ , if either $ p&lt;q $ and $ x_{1}=y_{1},x_{2}=y_{2},...\\ ,x_{p}=y_{p} $ , or there is such number $ r $ $ (r&lt;p,r&lt;q) $ , that $ x_{1}=y_{1},x_{2}=y_{2},...\\ ,x_{r}=y_{r} $ and $ x_{r+1}&lt;y_{r+1} $ . The characters of the strings are compared by their ASCII codes.",
