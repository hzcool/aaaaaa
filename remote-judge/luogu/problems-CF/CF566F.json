    "description": "As you must know, the maximum clique problem in an arbitrary graph is $ NP $ -hard. Nevertheless, for some graphs of specific kinds it can be solved effectively.\n\nJust in case, let us remind you that a clique in a non-directed graph is a subset of the vertices of a graph, such that any two vertices of this subset are connected by an edge. In particular, an empty set of vertexes and a set consisting of a single vertex, are cliques.\n\nLet's define a divisibility graph for a set of positive integers $ A={a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}} $ as follows. The vertices of the given graph are numbers from set $ A $ , and two numbers $ a_{i} $ and $ a_{j} $ ( $ i\u2260j $ ) are connected by an edge if and only if either $ a_{i} $ is divisible by $ a_{j} $ , or $ a_{j} $ is divisible by $ a_{i} $ .\n\nYou are given a set of non-negative integers $ A $ . Determine the size of a maximum clique in a divisibility graph for set $ A $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{6} $ ), that sets the size of set $ A $ .\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ distinct positive integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{6} $ ) \u2014 elements of subset $ A $ . The numbers in the line follow in the ascending order.",
