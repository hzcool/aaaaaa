    "description": "Drazil is a monkey. He lives in a circular park. There are $ n $ trees around the park. The distance between the $ i $ -th tree and ( $ i+1 $ )-st trees is $ d_{i} $ , the distance between the $ n $ -th tree and the first tree is $ d_{n} $ . The height of the $ i $ -th tree is $ h_{i} $ .\n\nDrazil starts each day with the morning run. The morning run consists of the following steps:\n\n- Drazil chooses two different trees\n- He starts with climbing up the first tree\n- Then he climbs down the first tree, runs around the park (in one of two possible directions) to the second tree, and climbs on it\n- Then he finally climbs down the second tree.\n\nBut there are always children playing around some consecutive trees. Drazil can't stand children, so he can't choose the trees close to children. He even can't stay close to those trees.\n\nIf the two trees Drazil chooses are $ x $ -th and $ y $ -th, we can estimate the energy the morning run takes to him as $ 2(h_{x}+h_{y})+dist(x,y) $ . Since there are children on exactly one of two arcs connecting $ x $ and $ y $ , the distance $ dist(x,y) $ between trees $ x $ and $ y $ is uniquely defined.\n\nNow, you know that on the $ i $ -th day children play between $ a_{i} $ -th tree and $ b_{i} $ -th tree. More formally, if $ a_{i}<=b_{i} $ , children play around the trees with indices from range $ [a_{i},b_{i}] $ , otherwise they play around the trees with indices from ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF515E/d3b74f54842bc3f076dfae535193a349f2e5a3fa.png).\n\nPlease help Drazil to determine which two trees he should choose in order to consume the most energy (since he wants to become fit and cool-looking monkey) and report the resulting amount of energy for each day.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integer $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 3<=n<=10^{5} $ , $ 1<=m<=10^{5} $ ), denoting number of trees and number of days, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ d_{1},d_{2},...,d_{n} $ ( $ 1<=d_{i}<=10^{9} $ ), the distances between consecutive trees.\n\nThe third line contains $ n $ integers $ h_{1},h_{2},...,h_{n} $ ( $ 1<=h_{i}<=10^{9} $ ), the heights of trees.\n\nEach of following $ m $ lines contains two integers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n $ ) describing each new day. There are always at least two different trees Drazil can choose that are not affected by children.",
