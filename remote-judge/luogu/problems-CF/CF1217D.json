The $ k $ -coloring is good if and only if there no cycle formed by edges of same color.\n\nFind a good $ k $ -coloring of given digraph with minimum possible $ k $ .",

Each edge is a pair of integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1 \\le u, v \\le n $ , $ u \\ne v $ ) \u2014 there is directed edge from $ u $ to $ v $ in the graph.\n\nIt is guaranteed that each ordered pair $ (u, v) $ appears in the list of edges at most once.",
