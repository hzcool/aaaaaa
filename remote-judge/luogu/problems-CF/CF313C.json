    "description": "Ilya is a very good-natured lion. He likes maths. Of all mathematical objects, his favourite one is matrices. Now he's faced a complicated matrix problem he needs to solve.\n\nHe's got a square $ 2^{n}\u00d72^{n} $ -sized matrix and $ 4^{n} $ integers. You need to arrange all these numbers in the matrix (put each number in a single individual cell) so that the beauty of the resulting matrix with numbers is maximum.\n\nThe beauty of a $ 2^{n}\u00d72^{n} $ -sized matrix is an integer, obtained by the following algorithm:\n\n1. Find the maximum element in the matrix. Let's denote it as $ m $ .\n2. If $ n=0 $ , then the beauty of the matrix equals $ m $ . Otherwise, a matrix can be split into 4 non-intersecting $ 2^{n-1}\u00d72^{n-1} $ -sized submatrices, then the beauty of the matrix equals the sum of number $ m $ and other four beauties of the described submatrices.\n\nAs you can see, the algorithm is recursive.\n\nHelp Ilya, solve the problem and print the resulting maximum beauty of the matrix.",
