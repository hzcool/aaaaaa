    "description": "Every December, VK traditionally holds an event for its employees named \"Secret Santa\". Here's how it happens.\n\n $ n $ employees numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ take part in the event. Each employee $ i $ is assigned a different employee $ b_i $ , to which employee $ i $ has to make a new year gift. Each employee is assigned to exactly one other employee, and nobody is assigned to themselves (but two employees may be assigned to each other). Formally, all $ b_i $ must be distinct integers between $ 1 $ and $ n $ , and for any $ i $ , $ b_i \\ne i $ must hold.\n\nThe assignment is usually generated randomly. This year, as an experiment, all event participants have been asked who they wish to make a gift to. Each employee $ i $ has said that they wish to make a gift to employee $ a_i $ .\n\nFind a valid assignment $ b $ that maximizes the number of fulfilled wishes of the employees.",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^5 $ ). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of participants of the event.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le n $ ; $ a_i \\ne i $ ) \u2014 wishes of the employees in order from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, print two lines.\n\nIn the first line, print a single integer $ k $ ( $ 0 \\le k \\le n $ ) \u2014 the number of fulfilled wishes in your assignment.\n\nIn the second line, print $ n $ distinct integers $ b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n $ ( $ 1 \\le b_i \\le n $ ; $ b_i \\ne i $ ) \u2014 the numbers of employees assigned to employees $ 1, 2, \\ldots, n $ .\n\n $ k $ must be equal to the number of values of $ i $ such that $ a_i = b_i $ , and must be as large as possible.
