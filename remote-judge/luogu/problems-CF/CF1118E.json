    "description": "The king of Berland organizes a ball! $ n $ pair are invited to the ball, they are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Each pair consists of one man and one woman. Each dancer (either man or woman) has a monochrome costume. The color of each costume is represented by an integer from $ 1 $ to $ k $ , inclusive.\n\nLet $ b_i $ be the color of the man's costume and $ g_i $ be the color of the woman's costume in the $ i $ -th pair. You have to choose a color for each dancer's costume (i.e. values $ b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n $ and $ g_1, g_2, \\dots g_n $ ) in such a way that:\n\n1. for every $ i $ : $ b_i $ and $ g_i $ are integers between $ 1 $ and $ k $ , inclusive;\n2. there are no two completely identical pairs, i.e. no two indices $ i, j $ ( $ i \\ne j $ ) such that $ b_i = b_j $ and $ g_i = g_j $ at the same time;\n3. there is no pair such that the color of the man's costume is the same as the color of the woman's costume in this pair, i.e. $ b_i \\ne g_i $ for every $ i $ ;\n4. for each two consecutive (adjacent) pairs both man's costume colors and woman's costume colors differ, i.e. for every $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n-1 $ the conditions $ b_i \\ne b_{i + 1} $ and $ g_i \\ne g_{i + 1} $ hold.\n\nLet's take a look at the examples of bad and good color choosing (for $ n=4 $ and $ k=3 $ , man is the first in a pair and woman is the second):\n\nBad color choosing:\n\n- $ (1, 2) $ , $ (2, 3) $ , $ (3, 2) $ , $ (1, 2) $ \u2014 contradiction with the second rule (there are equal pairs);\n- $ (2, 3) $ , $ (1, 1) $ , $ (3, 2) $ , $ (1, 3) $ \u2014 contradiction with the third rule (there is a pair with costumes of the same color);\n- $ (1, 2) $ , $ (2, 3) $ , $ (1, 3) $ , $ (2, 1) $ \u2014 contradiction with the fourth rule (there are two consecutive pairs such that colors of costumes of men/women are the same).\n\nGood color choosing:\n\n- $ (1, 2) $ , $ (2, 1) $ , $ (1, 3) $ , $ (3, 1) $ ;\n- $ (1, 2) $ , $ (3, 1) $ , $ (2, 3) $ , $ (3, 2) $ ;\n- $ (3, 1) $ , $ (1, 2) $ , $ (2, 3) $ , $ (3, 2) $ .\n\nYou have to find any suitable color choosing or say that no suitable choosing exists.",

    "outputFormat": "If it is impossible to find any suitable colors choosing, print \"NO\".\n\nOtherwise print \"YES\" and then the colors of the costumes of pairs in the next $ n $ lines.
