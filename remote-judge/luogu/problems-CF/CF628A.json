    "description": "A tennis tournament with $ n $ participants is running. The participants are playing by an olympic system, so the winners move on and the losers drop out.\n\nThe tournament takes place in the following way (below, $ m $ is the number of the participants of the current round):\n\n- let $ k $ be the maximal power of the number $ 2 $ such that $ k<=m $ ,\n- $ k $ participants compete in the current round and a half of them passes to the next round, the other $ m-k $ participants pass to the next round directly,\n- when only one participant remains, the tournament finishes.\n\nEach match requires $ b $ bottles of water for each participant and one bottle for the judge. Besides $ p $ towels are given to each participant for the whole tournament.\n\nFind the number of bottles and towels needed for the tournament.\n\nNote that it's a tennis tournament so in each match two participants compete (one of them will win and the other will lose).",
