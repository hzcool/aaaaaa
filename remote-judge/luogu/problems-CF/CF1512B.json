These cells can be in the same row or column.\n\nYou are to mark two more cells so that they are the corners of a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.\n\nFor example, if $ n=4 $ and a rectangular field looks like this (there are asterisks in the marked cells):\n\n  $$\\begin{matrix}\n.&.&*&.\\\\\n.&.&.&.\\\\\n*&.&.&.\\\\\n.&.&.&.\\\\\n\\end{matrix}$$\n\nThen you can mark two more cells as follows\n\n $$\\begin{matrix}\n*&.&*&.\\\\\n.&.&.&.\\\\\n*&.&*&.\\\\\n.&.&.&.\\\\\n\\end{matrix} $$\n\nIf there are several possible solutions, then print any of them.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 400 $ ).
