    "description": "You are given a non-empty line $ s $ and an integer $ k $ . The following operation is performed with this line exactly once:\n\n- A line is split into at most $ k $ non-empty substrings, i.e. string $ s $ is represented as a concatenation of a set of strings $ s=t_{1}+t_{2}+...+t_{m} $ , $ 1<=m<=k $ .\n- Some of strings $ t_{i} $ are replaced by strings $ t_{i}^{r} $ , that is, their record from right to left.\n- The lines are concatenated back in the same order, we get string $ s'=t'_{1}t'_{2}...\\ t'_{m} $ , where $ t'_{i} $ equals $ t_{i} $ or $ t_{i}^{r} $ .\n\nYour task is to determine the lexicographically smallest string that could be the result of applying the given operation to the string $ s $ .",
