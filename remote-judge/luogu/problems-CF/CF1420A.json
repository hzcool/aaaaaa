Oh it's funny? Because we've been at this for twelve hours and you haven't solved it either, so I don't know why you're laughing. You've got one hour! Solve it!\n\n\n\n\n\nWheatley decided to try to make a test chamber. He made a nice test chamber, but there was only one detail absent \u2014 cubes.\n\nFor completing the chamber Wheatley needs $ n $ cubes. $ i $ -th cube has a volume $ a_i $ .\n\nWheatley has to place cubes in such a way that they would be sorted in a non-decreasing order by their volume. Formally, for each $ i>1 $ , $ a_{i-1} \\le a_i $ must hold.\n\nTo achieve his goal, Wheatley can exchange two neighbouring cubes. It means that for any $ i>1 $ you can exchange cubes on positions $ i-1 $ and $ i $ .\n\nBut there is a problem: Wheatley is very impatient. If Wheatley needs more than $ \\frac{n \\cdot (n-1)}{2}-1 $ exchange operations, he won't do this boring work.\n\nWheatly wants to know: can cubes be sorted under this conditions?",

Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one positive integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4 $ ) \u2014 number of cubes.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ positive integers $ a_i $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 volumes of cubes.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
