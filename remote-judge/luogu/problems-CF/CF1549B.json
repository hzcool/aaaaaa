    "description": "There is a chessboard of size $ n $ by $ n $ . The square in the $ i $ -th row from top and $ j $ -th column from the left is labelled $ (i,j) $ .\n\nCurrently, Gregor has some pawns in the $ n $ -th row. There are also enemy pawns in the $ 1 $ -st row. On one turn, Gregor moves one of his pawns. A pawn can move one square up (from $ (i,j) $ to $ (i-1,j) $ ) if there is no pawn in the destination square. Additionally, a pawn can move one square diagonally up (from $ (i,j) $ to either $ (i-1,j-1) $ or $ (i-1,j+1) $ ) if and only if there is an enemy pawn in that square. The enemy pawn is also removed.\n\nGregor wants to know what is the maximum number of his pawns that can reach row $ 1 $ ?\n\nNote that only Gregor takes turns in this game, and the enemy pawns never move. Also, when Gregor's pawn reaches row $ 1 $ , it is stuck and cannot make any further moves.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1\\le t\\le 2\\cdot 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2\\le n\\le 2\\cdot{10}^{5} $ ) \u2014 the size of the chessboard.\n\nThe second line consists of a string of binary digits of length $ n $ , where a $ 1 $ in the $ i $ -th position corresponds to an enemy pawn in the $ i $ -th cell from the left, and $ 0 $ corresponds to an empty cell.\n\nThe third line consists of a string of binary digits of length $ n $ , where a $ 1 $ in the $ i $ -th position corresponds to a Gregor's pawn in the $ i $ -th cell from the left, and $ 0 $ corresponds to an empty cell.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ across all test cases is less than $ 2\\cdot{10}^{5} $ .",
