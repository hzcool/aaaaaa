    "description": "You are given a permutation $ p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n $ . Then, an undirected graph is constructed in the following way: add an edge between vertices $ i $ , $ j $ such that $ i < j $ if and only if $ p_i > p_j $ . Your task is to count the number of connected components in this graph.\n\nTwo vertices $ u $ and $ v $ belong to the same connected component if and only if there is at least one path along edges connecting $ u $ and $ v $ .\n\nA permutation is an array consisting of $ n $ distinct integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in arbitrary order. For example, $ [2,3,1,5,4] $ is a permutation, but $ [1,2,2] $ is not a permutation ( $ 2 $ appears twice in the array) and $ [1,3,4] $ is also not a permutation ( $ n=3 $ but there is $ 4 $ in the array).",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the length of the permutation.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n $ ( $ 1 \\le p_i \\le n $ ) \u2014 the elements of the permutation.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
