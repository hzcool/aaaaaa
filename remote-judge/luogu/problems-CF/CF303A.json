    "description": "Bike is interested in permutations. A permutation of length $ n $ is an integer sequence such that each integer from 0 to $ (n-1) $ appears exactly once in it. For example, $ [0,2,1] $ is a permutation of length 3 while both $ [0,2,2] $ and $ [1,2,3] $ is not.\n\nA permutation triple of permutations of length $ n $ $ (a,b,c) $ is called a Lucky Permutation Triple if and only if ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF303A/bd0aa9c2cfa6e7dfc9681d8813c19703f16dbc42.png). The sign $ a_{i} $ denotes the $ i $ -th element of permutation $ a $ . The modular equality described above denotes that the remainders after dividing $ a_{i}+b_{i} $ by $ n $ and dividing $ c_{i} $ by $ n $ are equal.\n\nNow, he has an integer $ n $ and wants to find a Lucky Permutation Triple. Could you please help him?",

    "outputFormat": "If no Lucky Permutation Triple of length $ n $ exists print -1.\n\nOtherwise, you need to print three lines. Each line contains $ n $ space-seperated integers. The first line must contain permutation $ a $ , the second line \u2014 permutation $ b $ , the third \u2014 permutation $ c $ .\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
