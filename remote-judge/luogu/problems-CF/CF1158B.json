    "description": "Let $ s $ be some string consisting of symbols \"0\" or \"1\". Let's call a string $ t $ a substring of string $ s $ , if there exists such number $ 1 \\leq l \\leq |s| - |t| + 1 $ that $ t = s_l s_{l+1} \\ldots s_{l + |t| - 1} $ . Let's call a substring $ t $ of string $ s $ unique, if there exist only one such $ l $ .\n\nFor example, let $ s =  $ \"1010111\". A string $ t =  $ \"010\" is an unique substring of $ s $ , because $ l = 2 $ is the only one suitable number. But, for example $ t =  $ \"10\" isn't a unique substring of $ s $ , because $ l = 1 $ and $ l = 3 $ are suitable. And for example $ t = $ \"00\" at all isn't a substring of $ s $ , because there is no suitable $ l $ .\n\nToday Vasya solved the following problem at the informatics lesson: given a string consisting of symbols \"0\" and \"1\", the task is to find the length of its minimal unique substring. He has written a solution to this problem and wants to test it. He is asking you to help him.\n\nYou are given $ 2 $ positive integers $ n $ and $ k $ , such that $ (n \\bmod 2) = (k \\bmod 2) $ , where $ (x \\bmod 2) $ is operation of taking remainder of $ x $ by dividing on $ 2 $ . Find any string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ symbols \"0\" or \"1\", such that the length of its minimal unique substring is equal to $ k $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ , separated by spaces ( $ 1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 100\\,000 $ , $ (k \\bmod 2) = (n \\bmod 2) $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "Print a string $ s $ of length $ n $ , consisting of symbols \"0\" and \"1\". Minimal length of the unique substring of $ s $ should be equal to $ k $ . You can find any suitable string. It is guaranteed, that there exists at least one such string.",

    "hint": "In the first test, it's easy to see, that the only unique substring of string $ s =  $ \"1111\" is all string $ s $ , which has length $ 4 $ .\n\nIn the second test a string $ s =  $ \"01010\" has minimal unique substring $ t = $ \"101\", which has length $ 3 $ .\n\nIn the third test a string $ s =  $ \"1011011\" has minimal unique substring $ t = $ \"110\", which has length $ 3 $ .",
