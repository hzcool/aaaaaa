    "description": "One day Masha was walking in the park and found a graph under a tree... Surprised? Did you think that this problem would have some logical and reasoned story? No way! So, the problem...\n\nMasha has an oriented graph which $ i $ -th vertex contains some positive integer $ a_i $ . Initially Masha can put a coin at some vertex. In one operation she can move a coin placed in some vertex $ u $ to any other vertex $ v $ such that there is an oriented edge $ u \\to v $ in the graph. Each time when the coin is placed in some vertex $ i $ , Masha write down an integer $ a_i $ in her notebook (in particular, when Masha initially puts a coin at some vertex, she writes an integer written at this vertex in her notebook). Masha wants to make exactly $ k - 1 $ operations in such way that the maximum number written in her notebook is as small as possible.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ , $ 0 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ , $ 1 \\le k \\le 10^{18} $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices and edges in the graph, and the number of operation that Masha should make.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_i $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the numbers written in graph vertices.\n\nEach of the following $ m $ lines contains two integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1 \\le u \\ne v \\le n $ ) \u2014 it means that there is an edge $ u \\to v $ in the graph.\n\nIt's guaranteed that graph doesn't contain loops and multi-edges.",
    "outputFormat": "Print one integer \u2014 the minimum value of the maximum number that Masha wrote in her notebook during optimal coin movements.\n\nIf Masha won't be able to perform $ k - 1 $ operations, print $ -1 $ .",
