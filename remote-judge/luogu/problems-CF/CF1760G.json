    "description": "You are given a weighted tree with $ n $ vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected graph without any cycles. A weighted tree is a tree in which each edge has a certain weight. The tree is undirected, it doesn't have a root.\n\nSince trees bore you, you decided to challenge yourself and play a game on the given tree.\n\nIn a move, you can travel from a node to one of its neighbors (another node it has a direct edge with).\n\nYou start with a variable $ x $ which is initially equal to $ 0 $ . When you pass through edge $ i $ , $ x $ changes its value to $ x ~\\mathsf{XOR}~ w_i $ (where $ w_i $ is the weight of the $ i $ -th edge).\n\nYour task is to go from vertex $ a $ to vertex $ b $ , but you are allowed to enter node $ b $ if and only if after traveling to it, the value of $ x $ will become $ 0 $ . In other words, you can travel to node $ b $ only by using an edge $ i $ such that $ x ~\\mathsf{XOR}~ w_i = 0 $ . Once you enter node $ b $ the game ends and you win.\n\nAdditionally, you can teleport at most once at any point in time to any vertex except vertex $ b $ . You can teleport from any vertex, even from $ a $ .\n\nAnswer with \"YES\" if you can reach vertex $ b $ from $ a $ , and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nNote that $ \\mathsf{XOR} $ represents the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\leq t \\leq 1000 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $ n $ , $ a $ , and $ b $ ( $ 2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $ ), ( $ 1 \\leq a, b \\leq n; a \\ne b $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices, and the starting and desired ending node respectively.\n\nEach of the next $ n-1 $ lines denotes an edge of the tree. Edge $ i $ is denoted by three integers $ u_i $ , $ v_i $ and $ w_i $ \u2014 the labels of vertices it connects ( $ 1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n; u_i \\ne v_i; 1 \\leq w_i \\leq 10^9 $ ) and the weight of the respective edge.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",

Now, we can teleport to node $ 3 $ and travel from node $ 3 $ to node $ 4 $ , reaching node $ b $ , since $ x $ became equal to $ 0 $ in the end, so we should answer \"YES\".\n\nFor the second test case, we have no moves, since we can't teleport to node $ b $ and the only move we have is to travel to node $ 2 $ which is impossible since $ x $ wouldn't be equal to $ 0 $ when reaching it, so we should answer \"NO\".",
