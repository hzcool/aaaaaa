    "description": " $ n $ people are standing in a line to play table tennis. At first, the first two players in the line play a game. Then the loser goes to the end of the line, and the winner plays with the next person from the line, and so on. They play until someone wins $ k $ games in a row. This player becomes the winner.\n\nFor each of the participants, you know the power to play table tennis, and for all players these values are different. In a game the player with greater power always wins. Determine who will be the winner.",

It's guaranteed that this line contains a valid permutation, i.e. all $ a_{i} $ are distinct.",
