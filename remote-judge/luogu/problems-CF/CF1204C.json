It is obvious that the sequence $ p $ is good but your task is to find the shortest good subsequence.\n\nIf there are multiple shortest good subsequences, output any of them.",

The sequence $ 1-2-4 $ is good because it is the subsequence of the given path, its first and the last elements are equal to the first and the last elements of the given path respectively, and the shortest path passing through vertexes $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ in that order is $ 1-2-3-4 $ . Note that subsequences $ 1-4 $ and $ 1-3-4 $ aren't good because in both cases the shortest path passing through the vertexes of these sequences is $ 1-3-4 $ .\n\nIn the third example, the graph is full so any sequence of vertexes in which any two consecutive elements are distinct defines a path consisting of the same number of vertexes.\n\nIn the fourth example, the paths $ 1-2-4 $ and $ 1-3-4 $ are the shortest paths passing through the vertexes $ 1 $ and $ 4 $ .",
