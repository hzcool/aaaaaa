    "description": "A $ k $ -multiple free set is a set of integers where there is no pair of integers where one is equal to another integer multiplied by $ k $ . That is, there are no two integers $ x $ and $ y $ $ (x<y) $ from the set, such that $ y=x\u00b7k $ .\n\nYou're given a set of $ n $ distinct positive integers. Your task is to find the size of it's largest $ k $ -multiple free subset.",
