    "description": "Little Dima misbehaved during a math lesson a lot and the nasty teacher Mr. Pickles gave him the following problem as a punishment.\n\nFind all integer solutions $ x $ $ (0&lt;x&lt;10^{9}) $ of the equation:\n\n $ x=b\u00b7s(x)^{a}+c, $ where $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ are some predetermined constant values and function $ s(x) $ determines the sum of all digits in the decimal representation of number $ x $ .\n\nThe teacher gives this problem to Dima for each lesson. He changes only the parameters of the equation: $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ . Dima got sick of getting bad marks and he asks you to help him solve this challenging problem.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three space-separated integers: $ a,b,c $ $ (1<=a<=5;\u00a01<=b<=10000;\u00a0-10000<=c<=10000) $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Print integer $ n $ \u2014 the number of the solutions that you've found. Next print $ n $ integers in the increasing order \u2014 the solutions of the given equation. Print only integer solutions that are larger than zero and strictly less than $ 10^{9} $ .",
