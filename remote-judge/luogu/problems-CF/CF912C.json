    "description": "A lot of students spend their winter holidays productively. Vlad has advanced very well in doing so! For three days already, fueled by salads and tangerines \u2014 the leftovers from New Year celebration \u2014 he has been calibrating his rating in his favorite MOBA game, playing as a hero named Perun.\n\nPerun has an ultimate ability called \"Thunderwrath\". At the instant of its activation, each enemy on the map ( $ n $ of them in total) loses ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF912C/d216f79c4581ff07bac2eb40367610feb8c137c2.png) health points as a single-time effect. It also has a restriction: it can only activated when the moment of time is an integer. The initial bounty for killing an enemy is ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF912C/2078a0964de47cdee5ccf9b3fbbb9c2602fdb150.png).

Formally, if at some second $ t $ the ability is activated and the $ i $ -th enemy is killed as a result (i.e. his health drops to zero or lower), Vlad earns ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF912C/2affc6d4bcb10dc0ae3b3c9c0c973c94780f368d.png) units of gold.\n\nEvery enemy can receive damage, as well as be healed. There are multiple ways of doing so, but Vlad is not interested in details. For each of $ n $ enemies he knows:\n\n- ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF912C/fc4707d8a855c477b62b13b1470d38bb6766fbc9.png) \u2014 maximum number of health points for the $ i $ -th enemy;\n- ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF912C/8efcccd354ad1e78851168f9dfe9981ef086b631.png) \u2014 initial health of the enemy (on the $ 0 $ -th second);\n- ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF912C/dce4274c465d132023523d8a7f53bc4a706d2722.png) \u2014 the amount of health the $ i $ -th enemy can regenerate per second.\n\nThere also $ m $ health updates Vlad knows about:\n\n- ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF912C/085949a0fef92cec2ad6a8413640d4367b22ea30.png) \u2014 time when the health was updated;\n- ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF912C/b2ad7de3b3b780b7804e20a0428f7e5181e4453b.png) \u2014 the enemy whose health was updated;\n- ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF912C/fa9c2a28c567ce2c3bc995acf7706c9f11229fd1.png) \u2014 updated health points for $ enemy_{j} $ .\n\nObviously, Vlad wants to maximize his profit. If it's necessary, he could even wait for years to activate his ability at the right second. Help him determine the exact second (note that it must be an integer) from $ 0 $ (inclusively) to $ +\u221e $ so that a single activation of the ability would yield Vlad the maximum possible amount of gold, and print this amount.",
