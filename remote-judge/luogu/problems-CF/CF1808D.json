    "description": "Petya and his friend, the robot Petya++, have a common friend \u2014 the cyborg Petr#. Sometimes Petr# comes to the friends for a cup of tea and tells them interesting problems.\n\nToday, Petr# told them the following problem.\n\nA palindrome is a sequence that reads the same from left to right as from right to left. For example, $ [38, 12, 8, 12, 38] $ , $ [1] $ , and $ [3, 8, 8, 3] $ are palindromes.\n\nLet's call the palindromicity of a sequence $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ the minimum count of elements that need to be replaced to make this sequence a palindrome. For example, the palindromicity of the sequence $ [38, 12, 8, 38, 38] $ is $ 1 $ since it is sufficient to replace the number $ 38 $ at the fourth position with the number $ 12 $ . And the palindromicity of the sequence $ [3, 3, 5, 5, 5] $ is two since you can replace the first two threes with fives, and the resulting sequence $ [5, 5, 5, 5, 5] $ is a palindrome.\n\nGiven a sequence $ a $ of length $ n $ , and an odd integer $ k $ , you need to find the sum of palindromicity of all subarrays of length $ k $ , i. e., the sum of the palindromicity values for the sequences $ a_i, a_{i+1}, \\dots, a_{i+k-1} $ for all $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n-k+1 $ .\n\nThe students quickly solved the problem. Can you do it too?\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1808D/86f24a4a8ddcd54e3f5304c40e3875fe7ba6699c.png)",

The total palindromicity is $ 1+1+0+2 = 4 $ .\n\nIn the second example, the only substring of length $ 9 $ coincides with the entire string, and its palindromicity is $ 0 $ , so the answer is also $ 0 $ .",
