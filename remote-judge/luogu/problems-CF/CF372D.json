    "description": "There is a tree consisting of $ n $ vertices. The vertices are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .\n\nLet's define the length of an interval $ [l,r] $ as the value $ r-l+1 $ . The score of a subtree of this tree is the maximum length of such an interval $ [l,r] $ that, the vertices with numbers $ l,l+1,...,r $ belong to the subtree.\n\nConsidering all subtrees of the tree whose size is at most $ k $ , return the maximum score of the subtree. Note, that in this problem tree is not rooted, so a subtree \u2014 is an arbitrary connected subgraph of the tree.",
    "inputFormat": "There are two integers in the first line, $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n<=10^{5} $ ). Each of the next $ n-1 $ lines contains integers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n,a_{i}\u2260b_{i} $ ). That means $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ are connected by a tree edge.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the input represents a tree.",
