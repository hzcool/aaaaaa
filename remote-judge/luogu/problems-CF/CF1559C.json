    "description": "The city where Mocha lives in is called Zhijiang. There are $ n+1 $ villages and $ 2n-1 $ directed roads in this city.\n\nThere are two kinds of roads:\n\n- $ n-1 $ roads are from village $ i $ to village $ i+1 $ , for all $ 1\\leq i \\leq n-1 $ .\n- $ n $ roads can be described by a sequence $ a_1,\\ldots,a_n $ . If $ a_i=0 $ , the $ i $ -th of these roads goes from village $ i $ to village $ n+1 $ , otherwise it goes from village $ n+1 $ to village $ i $ , for all $ 1\\leq i\\leq n $ .\n\nMocha plans to go hiking with Taki this weekend. To avoid the trip being boring, they plan to go through every village exactly once. They can start and finish at any villages. Can you help them to draw up a plan?",

Each test case consists of two lines.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 indicates that the number of villages is $ n+1 $ .\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \\le a_i \\le 1 $ ). If $ a_i=0 $ , it means that there is a road from village $ i $ to village $ n+1 $ . If $ a_i=1 $ , it means that there is a road from village $ n+1 $ to village $ i $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 10^4 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a line with $ n+1 $ integers, where the $ i $ -th number is the $ i $ -th village they will go through. If the answer doesn't exist, print $ -1 $ .\n\nIf there are multiple correct answers, you can print any one of them.",
