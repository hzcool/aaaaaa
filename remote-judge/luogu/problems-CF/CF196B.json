    "description": "We've got a rectangular $ n\u00d7m $ -cell maze. Each cell is either passable, or is a wall (impassable). A little boy found the maze and cyclically tiled a plane with it so that the plane became an infinite maze. Now on this plane cell $ (x,y) $ is a wall if and only if cell ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF196B/90d712000eb85a8bfa2ea0243ba4ea17c7b21954.png) is a wall.\n\nIn this problem ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF196B/8f971526abdeb0e01a924ce3de8c76d38e0d2bfd.png) is a remainder of dividing number $ a $ by number $ b $ .\n\nThe little boy stood at some cell on the plane and he wondered whether he can walk infinitely far away from his starting position. From cell $ (x,y) $ he can go to one of the following cells: $ (x,y-1) $ , $ (x,y+1) $ , $ (x-1,y) $ and $ (x+1,y) $ , provided that the cell he goes to is not a wall.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=1500 $ ) \u2014 the height and the width of the maze that the boy used to cyclically tile the plane.\n\nEach of the next $ n $ lines contains $ m $ characters \u2014 the description of the labyrinth. Each character is either a \"\\#\", that marks a wall, a \".\", that marks a passable cell, or an \"S\", that marks the little boy's starting point.\n\nThe starting point is a passable cell. It is guaranteed that character \"S\" occurs exactly once in the input.",
    "outputFormat": "Print \"Yes\" (without the quotes), if the little boy can walk infinitely far from the starting point. Otherwise, print \"No\" (without the quotes).",

    "hint": "In the first sample the little boy can go up for infinitely long as there is a \"clear path\" that goes vertically. He just needs to repeat the following steps infinitely: up, up, left, up, up, right, up.\n\nIn the second sample the vertical path is blocked. The path to the left doesn't work, too \u2014 the next \"copy\" of the maze traps the boy.",
