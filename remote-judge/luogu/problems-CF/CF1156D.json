    "description": "You are given a tree (an undirected connected acyclic graph) consisting of $ n $ vertices and $ n - 1 $ edges. A number is written on each edge, each number is either $ 0 $ (let's call such edges $ 0 $ -edges) or $ 1 $ (those are $ 1 $ -edges).\n\nLet's call an ordered pair of vertices $ (x, y) $ ( $ x \\ne y $ ) valid if, while traversing the simple path from $ x $ to $ y $ , we never go through a $ 0 $ -edge after going through a $ 1 $ -edge. Your task is to calculate the number of valid pairs in the tree.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 200000 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThen $ n - 1 $ lines follow, each denoting an edge of the tree. Each edge is represented by three integers $ x_i $ , $ y_i $ and $ c_i $ ( $ 1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n $ , $ 0 \\le c_i \\le 1 $ , $ x_i \\ne y_i $ ) \u2014 the vertices connected by this edge and the number written on it, respectively.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.",
