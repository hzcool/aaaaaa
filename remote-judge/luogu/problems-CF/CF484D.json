    "description": "In a kindergarten, the children are being divided into groups. The teacher put the children in a line and associated each child with his or her integer charisma value. Each child should go to exactly one group. Each group should be a nonempty segment of consecutive children of a line. A group's sociability is the maximum difference of charisma of two children in the group (in particular, if the group consists of one child, its sociability equals a zero).\n\nThe teacher wants to divide the children into some number of groups in such way that the total sociability of the groups is maximum. Help him find this value.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $n$ \u2014 the number of children in the line ($1\\le n\\le 10^6$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ \u2014 the charisma of the $i$-th child ($-10^9\\le a_i\\le 10^9$).",
    "outputFormat": "Print the maximum possible total sociability of all groups.",

    "hint": "In the first test sample one of the possible variants of an division is following: the first three children form a group with sociability 2, and the two remaining children form a group with sociability 1.\n\nIn the second test sample any division leads to the same result, the sociability will be equal to 0 in each group.",
