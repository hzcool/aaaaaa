    "description": "After winning gold and silver in IOI 2014, Akshat and Malvika want to have some fun. Now they are playing a game on a grid made of $ n $ horizontal and $ m $ vertical sticks.\n\nAn intersection point is any point on the grid which is formed by the intersection of one horizontal stick and one vertical stick.\n\nIn the grid shown below, $ n=3 $ and $ m=3 $ . There are $ n+m=6 $ sticks in total (horizontal sticks are shown in red and vertical sticks are shown in green). There are $ n\u00b7m=9 $ intersection points, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ 9 $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF451A/18b27511f71a42f9e0fd0b22af6d5248021325d7.png)The rules of the game are very simple. The players move in turns. Akshat won gold, so he makes the first move. During his/her move, a player must choose any remaining intersection point and remove from the grid all sticks which pass through this point. A player will lose the game if he/she cannot make a move (i.e. there are no intersection points remaining on the grid at his/her move).\n\nAssume that both players play optimally. Who will win the game?",

    "hint": "Explanation of the first sample:\n\nThe grid has four intersection points, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ 4 $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF451A/e0d83475f64b355b0a9b5538e74aa373b38a9909.png)If Akshat chooses intersection point $ 1 $ , then he will remove two sticks ( $ 1-2 $ and $ 1-3 $ ). The resulting grid will look like this.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF451A/c9bd491d9b8dd9c48045e00c65ed3725174a35a0.png)Now there is only one remaining intersection point (i.e. $ 4 $ ). Malvika must choose it and remove both remaining sticks. After her move the grid will be empty.\n\nIn the empty grid, Akshat cannot make any move, hence he will lose.\n\nSince all $ 4 $ intersection points of the grid are equivalent, Akshat will lose no matter which one he picks.",
