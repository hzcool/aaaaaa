    "description": "Anton loves transforming one permutation into another one by swapping elements for money, and Ira doesn't like paying for stupid games. Help them obtain the required permutation by paying as little money as possible.\n\nMore formally, we have two permutations, $ p $ and $ s $ of numbers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . We can swap $ p_{i} $ and $ p_{j} $ , by paying $ |i-j| $ coins for it. Find and print the smallest number of coins required to obtain permutation $ s $ from permutation $ p $ . Also print the sequence of swap operations at which we obtain a solution.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single number $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2000 $ ) \u2014 the length of the permutations.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of $ n $ numbers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ \u2014 permutation $ p $ . Each number from $ 1 $ to $ n $ occurs exactly once in this line.\n\nThe third line contains a sequence of $ n $ numbers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ \u2014 permutation $ s $ . Each number from $ 1 $ to $ n $ occurs once in this line.",
    "outputFormat": "In the first line print the minimum number of coins that you need to spend to transform permutation $ p $ into permutation $ s $ .\n\nIn the second line print number $ k $ ( $ 0<=k<=2\u00b710^{6} $ ) \u2014 the number of operations needed to get the solution.\n\nIn the next $ k $ lines print the operations. Each line must contain two numbers $ i $ and $ j $ ( $ 1<=i,j<=n $ , $ i\u2260j $ ), which means that you need to swap $ p_{i} $ and $ p_{j} $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the solution exists.",

    "hint": "In the first sample test we swap numbers on positions 3 and 4 and permutation $ p $ becomes 4 2 3 1. We pay $ |3-4|=1 $ coins for that. On second turn we swap numbers on positions 1 and 3 and get permutation $ 3241 $ equal to $ s $ . We pay $ |3-1|=2 $ coins for that. In total we pay three coins.",
