    "description": "Recently Ivan noticed an array $ a $ while debugging his code. Now Ivan can't remember this array, but the bug he was trying to fix didn't go away, so Ivan thinks that the data from this array might help him to reproduce the bug.\n\nIvan clearly remembers that there were $ n $ elements in the array, and each element was not less than $ 1 $ and not greater than $ n $ . Also he remembers $ q $ facts about the array. There are two types of facts that Ivan remembers:\n\n- $ 1 $ $ l_{i} $ $ r_{i} $ $ v_{i} $ \u2014 for each $ x $ such that $ l_{i}<=x<=r_{i} $ $ a_{x}>=v_{i} $ ;\n- $ 2 $ $ l_{i} $ $ r_{i} $ $ v_{i} $ \u2014 for each $ x $ such that $ l_{i}<=x<=r_{i} $ $ a_{x}<=v_{i} $ .\n\nAlso Ivan thinks that this array was a permutation, but he is not so sure about it. He wants to restore some array that corresponds to the $ q $ facts that he remembers and is very similar to permutation. Formally, Ivan has denoted the $ cost $ of array as follows:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF863F/198b849a40dcf1d15e369281568dd0d51bf7cdcd.png), where $ cnt(i) $ is the number of occurences of $ i $ in the array.\n\nHelp Ivan to determine minimum possible $ cost $ of the array that corresponds to the facts!",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integer numbers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 1<=n<=50 $ , $ 0<=q<=100 $ ).\n\nThen $ q $ lines follow, each representing a fact about the array. $ i $ -th line contains the numbers $ t_{i} $ , $ l_{i} $ , $ r_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ for $ i $ -th fact ( $ 1<=t_{i}<=2 $ , $ 1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=n $ , $ 1<=v_{i}<=n $ , $ t_{i} $ denotes the type of the fact).",
