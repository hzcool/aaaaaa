    "description": "Vus the Cossack has two binary strings, that is, strings that consist only of \"0\" and \"1\". We call these strings $ a $ and $ b $ . It is known that $ |b| \\leq |a| $ , that is, the length of $ b $ is at most the length of $ a $ .\n\nThe Cossack considers every substring of length $ |b| $ in string $ a $ . Let's call this substring $ c $ . He matches the corresponding characters in $ b $ and $ c $ , after which he counts the number of positions where the two strings are different. We call this function $ f(b, c) $ .\n\nFor example, let $ b = 00110 $ , and $ c = 11000 $ . In these strings, the first, second, third and fourth positions are different.\n\nVus the Cossack counts the number of such substrings $ c $ such that $ f(b, c) $ is even.\n\nFor example, let $ a = 01100010 $ and $ b = 00110 $ . $ a $ has four substrings of the length $ |b| $ : $ 01100 $ , $ 11000 $ , $ 10001 $ , $ 00010 $ .\n\n- $ f(00110, 01100) = 2 $ ;\n- $ f(00110, 11000) = 4 $ ;\n- $ f(00110, 10001) = 4 $ ;\n- $ f(00110, 00010) = 1 $ .\n\nSince in three substrings, $ f(b, c) $ is even, the answer is $ 3 $ .\n\nVus can not find the answer for big strings. That is why he is asking you to help him.",
