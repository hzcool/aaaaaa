    "description": "You are at your grandparents' house and you are playing an old video game on a strange console. Your controller has only two buttons and each button has a number written on it.\n\nInitially, your score is $ 0 $ . The game is composed of $ n $ rounds. For each $ 1\\le i\\le n $ , the $ i $ -th round works as follows.\n\nOn the screen, a symbol $ s_i $ appears, which is either $ \\texttt{+} $ (plus) or $ \\texttt{-} $ (minus). Then you must press one of the two buttons on the controller once. Suppose you press a button with the number $ x $ written on it: your score will increase by $ x $ if the symbol was $ \\texttt{+} $ and will decrease by $ x $ if the symbol was $ \\texttt{-} $ . After you press the button, the round ends.\n\nAfter you have played all $ n $ rounds, you win if your score is $ 0 $ .\n\nOver the years, your grandparents bought many different controllers, so you have $ q $ of them. The two buttons on the $ j $ -th controller have the numbers $ a_j $ and $ b_j $ written on them. For each controller, you must compute whether you can win the game playing with that controller.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of rounds.\n\nThe second line contains a string $ s $ of length $ n $ \u2014 where $ s_i $ is the symbol that will appear on the screen in the $ i $ -th round. It is guaranteed that $ s $ contains only the characters $ \\texttt{+} $ and $ \\texttt{-} $ .\n\nThe third line contains an integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \\le q \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of controllers.\n\nThe following $ q $ lines contain two integers $ a_j $ and $ b_j $ each ( $ 1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the numbers on the buttons of controller $ j $ .",

It is possible to show that there is no way to get a score of $ 0 $ using the second controller.",
