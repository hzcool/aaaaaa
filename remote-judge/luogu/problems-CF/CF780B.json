    "description": "The main road in Bytecity is a straight line from south to north. Conveniently, there are coordinates measured in meters from the southernmost building in north direction.\n\nAt some points on the road there are $ n $ friends, and $ i $ -th of them is standing at the point $ x_{i} $ meters and can move with any speed no greater than $ v_{i} $ meters per second in any of the two directions along the road: south or north.\n\nYou are to compute the minimum time needed to gather all the $ n $ friends at some point on the road. Note that the point they meet at doesn't need to have integer coordinate.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=60000 $ ) \u2014 the number of friends.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n} $ ( $ 1<=x_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the current coordinates of the friends, in meters.\n\nThe third line contains $ n $ integers $ v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{n} $ ( $ 1<=v_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the maximum speeds of the friends, in meters per second.",
