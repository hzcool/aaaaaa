    "description": "Today, Osama gave Fadi an integer $ X $ , and Fadi was wondering about the minimum possible value of $ max(a, b) $ such that $ LCM(a, b) $ equals $ X $ . Both $ a $ and $ b $ should be positive integers.\n\n $ LCM(a, b) $ is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both $ a $ and $ b $ . For example, $ LCM(6, 8) = 24 $ , $ LCM(4, 12) = 12 $ , $ LCM(2, 3) = 6 $ .\n\nOf course, Fadi immediately knew the answer. Can you be just like Fadi and find any such pair?",
