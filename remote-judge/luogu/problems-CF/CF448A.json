All the presents can be divided into two types: medals and cups. Bizon the Champion has $ a_{1} $ first prize cups, $ a_{2} $ second prize cups and $ a_{3} $ third prize cups. Besides, he has $ b_{1} $ first prize medals, $ b_{2} $ second prize medals and $ b_{3} $ third prize medals.\n\nNaturally, the rewards in the cupboard must look good, that's why Bizon the Champion decided to follow the rules:\n\n- any shelf cannot contain both cups and medals at the same time;\n- no shelf can contain more than five cups;\n- no shelf can have more than ten medals.\n\nHelp Bizon the Champion find out if we can put all the rewards so that all the conditions are fulfilled.",
