    "description": "Recently, Masha was presented with a chessboard with a height of $ n $ and a width of $ m $ .\n\nThe rows on the chessboard are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from bottom to top. The columns are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ m $ from left to right. Therefore, each cell can be specified with the coordinates $ (x,y) $ , where $ x $ is the column number, and $ y $ is the row number (do not mix up).\n\nLet us call a rectangle with coordinates $ (a,b,c,d) $ a rectangle lower left point of which has coordinates $ (a,b) $ , and the upper right one \u2014 $ (c,d) $ .\n\nThe chessboard is painted black and white as follows:\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1080C/58133c58a79999664b7a7d389f49886d52b2d9d5.png) An example of a chessboard.Masha was very happy with the gift and, therefore, invited her friends Maxim and Denis to show off. The guys decided to make her a treat \u2014 they bought her a can of white and a can of black paint, so that if the old board deteriorates, it can be repainted. When they came to Masha, something unpleasant happened: first, Maxim went over the threshold and spilled white paint on the rectangle $ (x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2) $ . Then after him Denis spilled black paint on the rectangle $ (x_3,y_3,x_4,y_4) $ .\n\nTo spill paint of color $ color $ onto a certain rectangle means that all the cells that belong to the given rectangle become $ color $ . The cell dyeing is superimposed on each other (if at first some cell is spilled with white paint and then with black one, then its color will be black).\n\nMasha was shocked! She drove away from the guests and decided to find out how spoiled the gift was. For this, she needs to know the number of cells of white and black color. Help her find these numbers!",
