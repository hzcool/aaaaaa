Now Arpa needs your help to implement the solution to that problem.",

    "hint": "In the first sample there is only one pair of $ i=1 $ and $ j=2 $ . ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF742B/c63bc815847bae57aeba51b11f6ec2211cbd1efa.png) so the answer is $ 1 $ .\n\nIn the second sample the only two pairs are $ i=3 $ , $ j=4 $ (since ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF742B/360a9ab048a3005f1d532cfb7c78e96ffd10455b.png)) and $ i=1 $ , $ j=5 $ (since ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF742B/e00da54f194d914d5a9270c780a44af611f46740.png)).\n\nA bitwise xor takes two bit integers of equal length and performs the logical xor operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is $ 1 $ if only the first bit is $ 1 $ or only the second bit is $ 1 $ , but will be $ 0 $ if both are $ 0 $ or both are $ 1 $ .
