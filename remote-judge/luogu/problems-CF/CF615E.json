For convenience the coordinate system is introduced, take a look at the picture to see how the coordinates of hexagon are defined:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF615E/7260dcf1ee40fd1194e895987c69d1d7c92f50b5.png)![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF615E/91f722e14e3f2875c1cec2e05543b6613c3b2f75.png) Ayrat is searching through the field. He started at point $ (0,0) $ and is moving along the spiral (see second picture). Sometimes he forgets where he is now. Help Ayrat determine his location after $ n $ moves.",
