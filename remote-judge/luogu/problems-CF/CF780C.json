    "description": "Andryusha goes through a park each day. The squares and paths between them look boring to Andryusha, so he decided to decorate them.\n\nThe park consists of $ n $ squares connected with $ (n-1) $ bidirectional paths in such a way that any square is reachable from any other using these paths. Andryusha decided to hang a colored balloon at each of the squares. The baloons' colors are described by positive integers, starting from $ 1 $ . In order to make the park varicolored, Andryusha wants to choose the colors in a special way. More precisely, he wants to use such colors that if $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ are distinct squares that $ a $ and $ b $ have a direct path between them, and $ b $ and $ c $ have a direct path between them, then balloon colors on these three squares are distinct.\n\nAndryusha wants to use as little different colors as possible. Help him to choose the colors!",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 3<=n<=2\u00b710^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of squares in the park.\n\nEach of the next $ (n-1) $ lines contains two integers $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ 1<=x,y<=n $ ) \u2014 the indices of two squares directly connected by a path.\n\nIt is guaranteed that any square is reachable from any other using the paths.",
    "outputFormat": "In the first line print single integer $ k $ \u2014 the minimum number of colors Andryusha has to use.\n\nIn the second line print $ n $ integers, the $ i $ -th of them should be equal to the balloon color on the $ i $ -th square. Each of these numbers should be within range from $ 1 $ to $ k $ .",

    "hint": "In the first sample the park consists of three squares: $ 1\u21923\u21922 $ .
