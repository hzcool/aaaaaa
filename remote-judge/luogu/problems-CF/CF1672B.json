The good strings are $ \\texttt{AB},\\texttt{AAB},\\texttt{AAAB},\\ldots $ . Note that $ \\texttt{B} $ is not a good string.\n\nYou are given an initially empty string $ s_1 $ .\n\nYou can perform the following operation any number of times:\n\n- Choose any position of $ s_1 $ and insert some good string in that position.\n\nGiven a string $ s_2 $ , can we turn $ s_1 $ into $ s_2 $ after some number of operations?",
