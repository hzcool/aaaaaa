Two Hoses $ x $ and $ y $ are in the same friendship group if and only if there is a sequence of Hoses $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{k} $ such that $ a_{i} $ and $ a_{i+1} $ are friends for each $ 1<=i&lt;k $ , and $ a_{1}=x $ and $ a_{k}=y $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF741B/728ee3bf7100b300a410e67b3d6aa62d4d0fdc8c.png)Arpa allowed to use the amphitheater of palace to Mehrdad for this party. Arpa's amphitheater can hold at most $ w $ weight on it.\n\nMehrdad is so greedy that he wants to invite some Hoses such that sum of their weights is not greater than $ w $ and sum of their beauties is as large as possible. Along with that, from each friendship group he can either invite all Hoses, or no more than one. Otherwise, some Hoses will be hurt.
