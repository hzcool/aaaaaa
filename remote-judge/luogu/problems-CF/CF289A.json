    "description": "Little penguin Polo adores integer segments, that is, pairs of integers $ [l;\u00a0r] $ $ (l<=r) $ .\n\nHe has a set that consists of $ n $ integer segments: $ [l_{1};\u00a0r_{1}],[l_{2};\u00a0r_{2}],...,[l_{n};\u00a0r_{n}] $ . We know that no two segments of this set intersect. In one move Polo can either widen any segment of the set 1 unit to the left or 1 unit to the right, that is transform $ [l;\u00a0r] $ to either segment $ [l-1;\u00a0r] $ , or to segment $ [l;\u00a0r+1] $ .\n\nThe value of a set of segments that consists of $ n $ segments $ [l_{1};\u00a0r_{1}],[l_{2};\u00a0r_{2}],...,[l_{n};\u00a0r_{n}] $ is the number of integers $ x $ , such that there is integer $ j $ , for which the following inequality holds, $ l_{j}<=x<=r_{j} $ .\n\nFind the minimum number of moves needed to make the value of the set of Polo's segments divisible by $ k $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,k<=10^{5} $ ). Each of the following $ n $ lines contain a segment as a pair of integers $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ ( $ -10^{5}<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=10^{5} $ ), separated by a space.\n\nIt is guaranteed that no two segments intersect. In other words, for any two integers $ i,j $ $ (1<=i&lt;j<=n) $ the following inequality holds, $ min(r_{i},r_{j})&lt;max(l_{i},l_{j}) $ .",
