    "description": "Ehab has an array $ a $ of length $ n $ . He has just enough free time to make a new array consisting of $ n $ copies of the old array, written back-to-back. What will be the length of the new array's longest increasing subsequence?\n\nA sequence $ a $ is a subsequence of an array $ b $ if $ a $ can be obtained from $ b $ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. The longest increasing subsequence of an array is the longest subsequence such that its elements are ordered in strictly increasing order.",
