    "description": "Mashmokh's boss, Bimokh, didn't like Mashmokh. So he fired him. Mashmokh decided to go to university and participate in ACM instead of finding a new job. He wants to become a member of Bamokh's team. In order to join he was given some programming tasks and one week to solve them. Mashmokh is not a very experienced programmer. Actually he is not a programmer at all. So he wasn't able to solve them. That's why he asked you to help him with these tasks. One of these tasks is the following.\n\nA sequence of $ l $ integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{l} $ $ (1<=b_{1}<=b_{2}<=...<=b_{l}<=n) $ is called good if each number divides (without a remainder) by the next number in the sequence. More formally ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF414B/c97c90bdd5f34b7b09ca5088db0c88621395bd9c.png) for all $ i $ $ (1<=i<=l-1) $ .\n\nGiven $ n $ and $ k $ find the number of good sequences of length $ k $ . As the answer can be rather large print it modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two space-separated integers $ n,k\u00a0(1<=n,k<=2000) $ .",
    "outputFormat": "Output a single integer \u2014 the number of good sequences of length $ k $ modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .",

        [

        [
            "6 4\n",
            "39\n"
        ],
        [

        ]
    ],
