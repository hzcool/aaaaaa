    "description": "Little X used to play a card game called \"24 Game\", but recently he has found it too easy. So he invented a new game.\n\nInitially you have a sequence of $ n $ integers: $ 1,2,...,n $ . In a single step, you can pick two of them, let's denote them $ a $ and $ b $ , erase them from the sequence, and append to the sequence either $ a+b $ , or $ a-b $ , or $ a\u00d7b $ .\n\nAfter $ n-1 $ steps there is only one number left. Can you make this number equal to $ 24 $ ?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ .",
    "outputFormat": "If it's possible, print \"YES\" in the first line. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\nIf there is a way to obtain $ 24 $ as the result number, in the following $ n-1 $ lines print the required operations an operation per line. Each operation should be in form: \" $ a $ $ op $ $ b $ = $ c $ \". Where $ a $ and $ b $ are the numbers you've picked at this operation; $ op $ is either \"+\", or \"-\", or \"\\*\"; $ c $ is the result of corresponding operation. Note, that the absolute value of $ c $ mustn't be greater than $ 10^{18} $ . The result of the last operation must be equal to $ 24 $ . Separate operator sign and equality sign from numbers with spaces.\n\nIf there are multiple valid answers, you may print any of them.",
