    "description": "Let's define the cost of a string $ s $ as the number of index pairs $ i $ and $ j $ ( $ 1 \\le i < j < |s| $ ) such that $ s_i = s_j $ and $ s_{i+1} = s_{j+1} $ .\n\nYou are given two positive integers $ n $ and $ k $ . Among all strings with length $ n $ that contain only the first $ k $ characters of the Latin alphabet, find a string with minimum possible cost. If there are multiple such strings with minimum cost \u2014 find any of them.",
