    "description": "A bitstring is a string consisting only of the characters 0 and 1. A bitstring is called $ k $ -balanced if every substring of size $ k $ of this bitstring has an equal amount of 0 and 1 characters ( $ \\frac{k}{2} $ of each).\n\nYou are given an integer $ k $ and a string $ s $ which is composed only of characters 0, 1, and ?. You need to determine whether you can make a $ k $ -balanced bitstring by replacing every ? characters in $ s $ with either 0 or 1.\n\nA string $ a $ is a substring of a string $ b $ if $ a $ can be obtained from $ b $ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.",

Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 2 \\le k \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5 $ , $ k $ is even) \u2014 the length of the string and the parameter for a balanced bitstring.\n\nThe next line contains the string $ s $ ( $ |s| = n $ ). It is given that $ s $ consists of only 0, 1, and ?.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 3 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
