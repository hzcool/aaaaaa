Your task is to sort this array in increasing order with the following operation (you may need to apply it multiple times):\n\n- choose two indexes, $ i $ and $ j $ ( $ 1<=i&lt;j<=n $ ; $ (j-i+1) $ is a prime number);\n- swap the elements on positions $ i $ and $ j $ ; in other words, you are allowed to apply the following sequence of assignments: $ tmp=a[i],a[i]=a[j],a[j]=tmp $ ( $ tmp $ is a temporary variable).\n\nYou do not need to minimize the number of used operations. However, you need to make sure that there are at most $ 5n $ operations.",
