    "description": "Your working week consists of $ n $ days numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , after day $ n $ goes day $ 1 $ again. And $ 3 $ of them are days off. One of the days off is the last day, day $ n $ . You have to decide when the other two are.\n\nChoosing days off, you pursue two goals:\n\n- No two days should go one after the other. Note that you can't make day $ 1 $ a day off because it follows day $ n $ .\n- Working segments framed by days off should be as dissimilar as possible in duration. More specifically, if the segments are of size $ l_1 $ , $ l_2 $ , and $ l_3 $ days long, you want to maximize $ \\min(|l_1 - l_2|, |l_2 - l_3|, |l_3 - l_1|) $ .\n\nOutput the maximum value of $ \\min(|l_1 - l_2|, |l_2 - l_3|, |l_3 - l_1|) $ that can be obtained.",

    "hint": "In the image below you can see the example solutions for the first two test cases. Chosen days off are shown in purple. Working segments are underlined in green.\n\nIn test case $ 1 $ , the only options for days off are days $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ , and $ 4 $ (because $ 1 $ and $ 5 $ are next to day $ n $ ). So the only way to place them without selecting neighboring days is to choose days $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ . Thus, $ l_1 = l_2 = l_3 = 1 $ , and the answer $ \\min(|l_1 - l_2|, |l_2 - l_3|, |l_3 - l_1|) = 0 $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1735A/dfed8ea3572e1cfecf8344e85d82669346a02118.png)For test case $ 2 $ , one possible way to choose days off is shown. The working segments have the lengths of $ 2 $ , $ 1 $ , and $ 4 $ days. So the minimum difference is $ 1 = \\min(1, 3, 2) = \\min(|2 - 1|, |1 - 4|, |4 - 2|) $ . It can be shown that there is no way to make it larger.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1735A/9237d7201ef863017ca99b182ec61519de1dc66c.png)",
