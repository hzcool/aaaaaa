The year of 2013 is the first year after the old 1987 with only distinct digits.\n\nNow you are suggested to solve the following problem: given a year number, find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one and has only distinct digits.",

    "outputFormat": "Print a single integer \u2014 the minimum year number that is strictly larger than $ y $ and all it's digits are distinct. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.",
