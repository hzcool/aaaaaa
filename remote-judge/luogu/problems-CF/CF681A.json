    "description": "Codeforces user' handle color depends on his rating \u2014 it is red if his rating is greater or equal to $ 2400 $ ; it is orange if his rating is less than $ 2400 $ but greater or equal to $ 2200 $ , etc. Each time participant takes part in a rated contest, his rating is changed depending on his performance.\n\nAnton wants the color of his handle to become red. He considers his performance in the rated contest to be good if he outscored some participant, whose handle was colored red before the contest and his rating has increased after it.\n\nAnton has written a program that analyses contest results and determines whether he performed good or not. Are you able to do the same?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) \u2014 the number of participants Anton has outscored in this contest .\n\nThe next $ n $ lines describe participants results: the $ i $ -th of them consists of a participant handle $ name_{i} $ and two integers $ before_{i} $ and $ after_{i} $ ( $ -4000<=before_{i},after_{i}<=4000 $ ) \u2014 participant's rating before and after the contest, respectively. Each handle is a non-empty string, consisting of no more than $ 10 $ characters, which might be lowercase and uppercase English letters, digits, characters \u00ab\\_\u00bb and \u00ab-\u00bb characters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all handles are distinct.",
