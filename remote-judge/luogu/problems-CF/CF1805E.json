    "description": "You are given a tree (a connected graph without cycles). Each vertex of the tree contains an integer. Let's define the $ \\mathrm{MAD} $ (maximum double) parameter of the tree as the maximum integer that occurs in the vertices of the tree at least $ 2 $ times. If no number occurs in the tree more than once, then we assume $ \\mathrm{MAD}=0 $ .\n\nNote that if you remove an edge from the tree, it splits into two trees. Let's compute the $ \\mathrm{MAD} $ parameters of the two trees and take the maximum of the two values. Let the result be the value of the deleted edge.\n\nFor each edge, find its value. Note that we don't actually delete any edges from the tree, the values are to be found independently.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nEach of the next $ n - 1 $ lines contains two integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1 \\le u, v \\le n $ ) \u2014 the ends of an edge of the tree. It's guaranteed that the given edges form a valid tree.\n\nThe last line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the numbers in the vertices.",
