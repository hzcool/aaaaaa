    "description": "In problems on strings one often has to find a string with some particular properties. The problem authors were reluctant to waste time on thinking of a name for some string so they called it good. A string is good if it doesn't have palindrome substrings longer than or equal to $ d $ .\n\nYou are given string $ s $ , consisting only of lowercase English letters. Find a good string $ t $ with length $ |s| $ , consisting of lowercase English letters, which is lexicographically larger than $ s $ . Of all such strings string $ t $ must be lexicographically minimum.\n\nWe will call a non-empty string $ s[a\u00a0...\u00a0b]=s_{a}s_{a+1}...\\ s_{b} $ $ (1<=a<=b<=|s|) $ a substring of string $ s=s_{1}s_{2}...\\ s_{|s|} $ .\n\nA non-empty string $ s=s_{1}s_{2}...\\ s_{n} $ is called a palindrome if for all $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ the following fulfills: $ s_{i}=s_{n-i+1} $ . In other words, palindrome read the same in both directions.\n\nString $ x=x_{1}x_{2}...\\ x_{|x|} $ is lexicographically larger than string $ y=y_{1}y_{2}...\\ y_{|y|} $ , if either $ |x|&gt;|y| $ and $ x_{1}=y_{1},x_{2}=y_{2},...\\ ,x_{|y|}=y_{|y|} $ , or there exists such number $ r $ $ (r&lt;|x|,r&lt;|y|) $ , that $ x_{1}=y_{1},x_{2}=y_{2},...\\ ,x_{r}=y_{r} $ and $ x_{r+1}&gt;y_{r+1} $ . Characters in such strings are compared like their ASCII codes.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains integer $ d $ ( $ 1<=d<=|s| $ ).\n\nThe second line contains a non-empty string $ s $ , its length is no more than $ 4\u00b710^{5} $ characters. The string consists of lowercase English letters.",
    "outputFormat": "Print the good string that lexicographically follows $ s $ , has the same length and consists of only lowercase English letters. If such string does not exist, print \"Impossible\" (without the quotes).",
