    "description": "Fox Ciel wants to write a task for a programming contest. The task is: \"You are given a simple undirected graph with $ n $ vertexes. Each its edge has unit length. You should calculate the number of shortest paths between vertex 1 and vertex 2.\"\n\nSame with some writers, she wants to make an example with some certain output: for example, her birthday or the number of her boyfriend. Can you help her to make a test case with answer equal exactly to $ k $ ?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=10^{9} $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "You should output a graph $ G $ with $ n $ vertexes ( $ 2<=n<=1000 $ ). There must be exactly $ k $ shortest paths between vertex 1 and vertex 2 of the graph.\n\nThe first line must contain an integer $ n $ . Then adjacency matrix $ G $ with $ n $ rows and $ n $ columns must follow. Each element of the matrix must be 'N' or 'Y'. If $ G_{ij} $ is 'Y', then graph $ G $ has a edge connecting vertex $ i $ and vertex $ j $ . Consider the graph vertexes are numbered from 1 to $ n $ .\n\nThe graph must be undirected and simple: $ G_{ii} $ = 'N' and $ G_{ij}=G_{ji} $ must hold. And there must be at least one path between vertex 1 and vertex 2. It's guaranteed that the answer exists. If there multiple correct answers, you can output any of them.",
