    "description": "Mr. Bender has a digital table of size $ n\u00d7n $ , each cell can be switched on or off. He wants the field to have at least $ c $ switched on squares. When this condition is fulfilled, Mr Bender will be happy.\n\nWe'll consider the table rows numbered from top to bottom from 1 to $ n $ , and the columns \u2014 numbered from left to right from 1 to $ n $ . Initially there is exactly one switched on cell with coordinates $ (x,y) $ ( $ x $ is the row number, $ y $ is the column number), and all other cells are switched off. Then each second we switch on the cells that are off but have the side-adjacent cells that are on.\n\nFor a cell with coordinates $ (x,y) $ the side-adjacent cells are cells with coordinates $ (x-1,y) $ , $ (x+1,y) $ , $ (x,y-1) $ , $ (x,y+1) $ .\n\nIn how many seconds will Mr. Bender get happy?",
