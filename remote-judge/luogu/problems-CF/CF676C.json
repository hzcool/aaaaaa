    "description": "High school student Vasya got a string of length $ n $ as a birthday present. This string consists of letters 'a' and 'b' only. Vasya denotes beauty of the string as the maximum length of a substring (consecutive subsequence) consisting of equal letters.\n\nVasya can change no more than $ k $ characters of the original string. What is the maximum beauty of the string he can achieve?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000,0<=k<=n $ ) \u2014 the length of the string and the maximum number of characters to change.\n\nThe second line contains the string, consisting of letters 'a' and 'b' only.",
