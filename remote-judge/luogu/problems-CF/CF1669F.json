Alice and Bob eat candies.\n\nAlice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row).\n\nBob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\n\nOf course, if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa).\n\nThey want to be fair.

    "hint": "For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is $ 2 $ because they eat two candies in total.\n\nFor the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight $ 7 $ ) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight $ 7 $ ). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is $ 6 $ (because they eat six candies in total).\n\nFor the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is $ 0 $ .\n\nFor the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights $ [7, 3, 20] $ and Bob will eat candies with weights $ [10, 8, 11, 1] $ , they each eat $ 30 $ weight. There is no better partition so the answer is $ 7 $ .",
