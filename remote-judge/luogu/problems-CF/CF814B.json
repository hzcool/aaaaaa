    "description": "Sengoku still remembers the mysterious \"colourful meteoroids\" she discovered with Lala-chan when they were little. In particular, one of the nights impressed her deeply, giving her the illusion that all her fancies would be realized.\n\nOn that night, Sengoku constructed a permutation $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ of integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ inclusive, with each integer representing a colour, wishing for the colours to see in the coming meteor outburst. Two incredible outbursts then arrived, each with $ n $ meteorids, colours of which being integer sequences $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ and $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ respectively. Meteoroids' colours were also between $ 1 $ and $ n $ inclusive, and the two sequences were not identical, that is, at least one $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) exists, such that $ a_{i}\u2260b_{i} $ holds.\n\nWell, she almost had it all \u2014 each of the sequences $ a $ and $ b $ matched exactly $ n-1 $ elements in Sengoku's permutation. In other words, there is exactly one $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) such that $ a_{i}\u2260p_{i} $ , and exactly one $ j $ ( $ 1<=j<=n $ ) such that $ b_{j}\u2260p_{j} $ .\n\nFor now, Sengoku is able to recover the actual colour sequences $ a $ and $ b $ through astronomical records, but her wishes have been long forgotten. You are to reconstruct any possible permutation Sengoku could have had on that night.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a positive integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=1000 $ ) \u2014 the length of Sengoku's permutation, being the length of both meteor outbursts at the same time.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=n $ ) \u2014 the sequence of colours in the first meteor outburst.\n\nThe third line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ ( $ 1<=b_{i}<=n $ ) \u2014 the sequence of colours in the second meteor outburst. At least one $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) exists, such that $ a_{i}\u2260b_{i} $ holds.",
    "outputFormat": "Output $ n $ space-separated integers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ , denoting a possible permutation Sengoku could have had. If there are more than one possible answer, output any one of them.\n\nInput guarantees that such permutation exists.",
