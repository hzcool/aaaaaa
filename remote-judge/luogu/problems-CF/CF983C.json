    "description": "You work in a big office. It is a $ 9 $ floor building with an elevator that can accommodate up to $ 4 $ people. It is your responsibility to manage this elevator.\n\nToday you are late, so there are queues on some floors already. For each person you know the floor where he currently is and the floor he wants to reach. Also, you know the order in which people came to the elevator.\n\nAccording to the company's rules, if an employee comes to the elevator earlier than another one, he has to enter the elevator earlier too (even if these employees stay on different floors). Note that the employees are allowed to leave the elevator in arbitrary order.\n\nThe elevator has two commands:\n\n- Go up or down one floor. The movement takes $ 1 $ second.\n- Open the doors on the current floor. During this operation all the employees who have reached their destination get out of the elevator. Then all the employees on the floor get in the elevator in the order they are queued up while it doesn't contradict the company's rules and there is enough space in the elevator. Each employee spends $ 1 $ second to get inside and outside the elevator.\n\nInitially the elevator is empty and is located on the floor $ 1 $ .\n\nYou are interested what is the minimum possible time you need to spend to deliver all the employees to their destination. It is not necessary to return the elevator to the floor $ 1 $ .",
