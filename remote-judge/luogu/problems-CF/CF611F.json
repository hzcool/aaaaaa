    "description": "Limak is a little polar bear. His parents told him to clean a house before the New Year's Eve. Their house is a rectangular grid with $ h $ rows and $ w $ columns. Each cell is an empty square.\n\nHe is a little bear and thus he can't clean a house by himself. Instead, he is going to use a cleaning robot.\n\nA cleaning robot has a built-in pattern of $ n $ moves, defined by a string of the length $ n $ . A single move (character) moves a robot to one of four adjacent cells. Each character is one of the following four: 'U' (up), 'D' (down), 'L' (left), 'R' (right). One move takes one minute.\n\nA cleaning robot must be placed and started in some cell. Then it repeats its pattern of moves till it hits a wall (one of four borders of a house). After hitting a wall it can be placed and used again.\n\nLimak isn't sure if placing a cleaning robot in one cell will be enough. Thus, he is going to start it $ w\u00b7h $ times, one time in each cell. Maybe some cells will be cleaned more than once but who cares?\n\nLimak asks you one question. How much time will it take to clean a house? Find and print the number of minutes modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ . It's also possible that a cleaning robot will never stop \u2014 then print \"-1\" (without the quotes) instead.\n\nPlacing and starting a robot takes no time, however, you must count a move when robot hits a wall. Take a look into samples for further clarification.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ h $ and $ w $ ( $ 1<=n,h,w<=500000 $ ) \u2014 the length of the pattern, the number of rows and the number of columns, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains a string of length $ n $ \u2014 the pattern of $ n $ moves. Each character is one of uppercase letters 'U', 'D', 'L' or 'R'.",
    "outputFormat": "Print one line with the answer.\n\nIf a cleaning robot will never stop, print \"-1\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print the number of minutes it will take to clean a house modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .",

    "hint": "In the first sample house is a grid with $ 10 $ rows and $ 2 $ columns. Starting a robot anywhere in the second column will result in only one move (thus, one minute of cleaning) in which robot will hit a wall \u2014 he tried to go right but there is no third column. Starting a robot anywhere in the first column will result in two moves. The total number of minutes is $ 10\u00b71+10\u00b72=30 $ .\n\nIn the second sample a started robot will try to move \"RULRULRULR...\" For example, for the leftmost cell in the second row robot will make $ 5 $ moves before it stops because of hitting an upper wall.",
