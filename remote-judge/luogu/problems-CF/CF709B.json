    "description": "Vasya takes part in the orienteering competition. There are $ n $ checkpoints located along the line at coordinates $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n} $ . Vasya starts at the point with coordinate $ a $ . His goal is to visit at least $ n-1 $ checkpoint in order to finish the competition. Participant are allowed to visit checkpoints in arbitrary order.\n\nVasya wants to pick such checkpoints and the order of visiting them that the total distance travelled is minimized. He asks you to calculate this minimum possible value.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ a $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ , $ -1000000<=a<=1000000 $ ) \u2014 the number of checkpoints and Vasya's starting position respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n} $ ( $ -1000000<=x_{i}<=1000000 $ ) \u2014 coordinates of the checkpoints.",

    "hint": "In the first sample Vasya has to visit at least two checkpoints. The optimal way to achieve this is the walk to the third checkpoints (distance is $ 12-10=2 $ ) and then proceed to the second one (distance is $ 12-7=5 $ ). The total distance is equal to $ 2+5=7 $ .\n\nIn the second sample it's enough to visit only one checkpoint so Vasya should just walk to the point $ -10 $ .",
