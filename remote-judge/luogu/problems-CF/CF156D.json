    "description": "As Sherlock Holmes was investigating another crime, he found a certain number of clues. Also, he has already found direct links between some of those clues. The direct links between the clues are mutual. That is, the direct link between clues $ A $ and $ B $ and the direct link between clues $ B $ and $ A $ is the same thing. No more than one direct link can exist between two clues.\n\nOf course Sherlock is able to find direct links between all clues. But it will take too much time and the criminals can use this extra time to hide. To solve the crime, Sherlock needs each clue to be linked to all other clues (maybe not directly, via some other clues). Clues $ A $ and $ B $ are considered linked either if there is a direct link between them or if there is a direct link between $ A $ and some other clue $ C $ which is linked to $ B $ .\n\nSherlock Holmes counted the minimum number of additional direct links that he needs to find to solve the crime. As it turns out, it equals $ T $ .\n\nPlease count the number of different ways to find exactly $ T $ direct links between the clues so that the crime is solved in the end. Two ways to find direct links are considered different if there exist two clues which have a direct link in one way and do not have a direct link in the other way.\n\nAs the number of different ways can turn out rather big, print it modulo $ k $ .",

It is guaranteed that any two clues are linked by no more than one direct link. Note that the direct links between the clues are mutual.",
