    "description": "There are $ n $ cities located along the one-way road. Cities are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in the direction of the road.\n\nThe $ i $ -th city had produced $ p_{i} $ units of goods. No more than $ s_{i} $ units of goods can be sold in the $ i $ -th city.\n\nFor each pair of cities $ i $ and $ j $ such that  $ 1<=i&lt;j<=n $  you can no more than once transport no more than $ c $ units of goods from the city $ i $ to the city $ j $ . Note that goods can only be transported from a city with a lesser index to the city with a larger index. You can transport goods between cities in any order.\n\nDetermine the maximum number of produced goods that can be sold in total in all the cities after a sequence of transportations.",
