    "description": "In this problem you will have to deal with a very special network.\n\nThe network consists of two parts: part $ A $ and part $ B $ . Each part consists of $ n $ vertices; $ i $ -th vertex of part $ A $ is denoted as $ A_{i} $ , and $ i $ -th vertex of part $ B $ is denoted as $ B_{i} $ .\n\nFor each index $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<n $ ) there is a directed edge from vertex $ A_{i} $ to vertex $ A_{i+1} $ , and from $ B_{i} $ to $ B_{i+1} $ , respectively. Capacities of these edges are given in the input. Also there might be several directed edges going from part $ A $ to part $ B $ (but never from $ B $ to $ A $ ).\n\nYou have to calculate the [maximum flow value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem) from $ A_{1} $ to $ B_{n} $ in this network. Capacities of edges connecting $ A_{i} $ to $ A_{i+1} $ might sometimes change, and you also have to maintain the maximum flow value after these changes. Apart from that, the network is fixed (there are no changes in part $ B $ , no changes of edges going from $ A $ to $ B $ , and no edge insertions or deletions).\n\nTake a look at the example and the notes to understand the structure of the network better.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integer numbers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ q $ ( $ 2<=n,m<=2\u00b710^{5} $ , $ 0<=q<=2\u00b710^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in each part, the number of edges going from $ A $ to $ B $ and the number of changes, respectively.\n\nThen $ n-1 $ lines follow, $ i $ -th line contains two integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ denoting that the edge from $ A_{i} $ to $ A_{i+1} $ has capacity $ x_{i} $ and the edge from $ B_{i} $ to $ B_{i+1} $ has capacity $ y_{i} $ ( $ 1<=x_{i},y_{i}<=10^{9} $ ).\n\nThen $ m $ lines follow, describing the edges from $ A $ to $ B $ . Each line contains three integers $ x $ , $ y $ and $ z $ denoting an edge from $ A_{x} $ to $ B_{y} $ with capacity $ z $ ( $ 1<=x,y<=n $ , $ 1<=z<=10^{9} $ ). There might be multiple edges from $ A_{x} $ to $ B_{y} $ .\n\nAnd then $ q $ lines follow, describing a sequence of changes to the network. $ i $ -th line contains two integers $ v_{i} $ and $ w_{i} $ , denoting that the capacity of the edge from $ A_{vi} $ to $ A_{vi}+1 $ is set to $ w_{i} $ ( $ 1<=v_{i}<n $ , $ 1<=w_{i}<=10^{9} $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "Firstly, print the maximum flow value in the original network. Then print $ q $ integers, $ i $ -th of them must be equal to the maximum flow value after $ i $ -th change.",
