    "description": "One of the SWERC judges has a dog named Boy. Besides being a good competitive programmer, Boy loves fresh air, so she wants to be walked at least twice a day. Walking Boy requires $ 120 $ consecutive minutes. Two walks cannot overlap, but one can start as soon as the previous one has finished.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1776A/78c7ec3373fdb4aaf6097566a036cee5a4aad5b2.png)Boy before and after getting ACCEPTED on this problem.\n\nToday, the judge sent $ n $ messages to the SWERC Discord server. The $ i $ -th message was sent $ a_i $ minutes after midnight. You know that, when walking Boy, the judge does not send any messages, but he can send a message right before or right after a walk. Is it possible that the judge walked Boy at least twice today?\n\nNote that a day has $ 1440 $ minutes, and a walk is considered to happen today if it starts at a minute $ s \\ge 0 $ and ends right before a minute $ e \\le 1440 $ . In that case, it must hold that $ e - s = 120 $ and, for every $ i = 1, \\, 2 \\, \\dots, \\, n $ , either $ a_i \\le s $ or $ a_i \\ge e $ .",

The descriptions of the $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of messages sent by the judge.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, \\, a_2, \\, \\dots, \\, a_n $ ( $ 0 \\le a_1 < a_2 < \\cdots < a_n < 1440 $ ) \u2014 the times at which the messages have been sent (in minutes elapsed from midnight).",
