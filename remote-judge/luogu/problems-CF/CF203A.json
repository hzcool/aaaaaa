    "description": "A boy Valera registered on site Codeforces as Valera, and wrote his first Codeforces Round #300. He boasted to a friend Arkady about winning as much as $ x $ points for his first contest. But Arkady did not believe his friend's words and decided to check whether Valera could have shown such a result.\n\nHe knows that the contest number $ 300 $ was unusual because there were only two problems. The contest lasted for $ t $ minutes, the minutes are numbered starting from zero. The first problem had the initial cost of $ a $ points, and every minute its cost reduced by $ d_{a} $ points. The second problem had the initial cost of $ b $ points, and every minute this cost reduced by $ d_{b} $ points. Thus, as soon as the zero minute of the contest is over, the first problem will cost $ a-d_{a} $ points, and the second problem will cost $ b-d_{b} $ points. It is guaranteed that at any moment of the contest each problem has a non-negative cost.\n\nArkady asks you to find out whether Valera could have got exactly $ x $ points for this contest. You should assume that Valera could have solved any number of the offered problems. You should also assume that for each problem Valera made no more than one attempt, besides, he could have submitted both problems at the same minute of the contest, starting with minute $ 0 $ and ending with minute number $ t-1 $ . Please note that Valera can't submit a solution exactly $ t $ minutes after the start of the contest or later.",
