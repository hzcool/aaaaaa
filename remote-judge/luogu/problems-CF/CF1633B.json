    "description": "You are given a string $ s $ , consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.\n\nYou have to choose a contiguous substring of $ s $ and remove all occurrences of the character, which is a strict minority in it, from the substring.\n\nThat is, if the amount of '0's in the substring is strictly smaller than the amount of '1's, remove all occurrences of '0' from the substring. If the amount of '1's is strictly smaller than the amount of '0's, remove all occurrences of '1'. If the amounts are the same, do nothing.\n\nYou have to apply the operation exactly once. What is the maximum amount of characters that can be removed?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe only line of each testcase contains a non-empty string $ s $ , consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.

    "hint": "In the first testcase, you can choose substrings \"0\", \"1\" or \"01\". In \"0\" the amount of '0' is $ 1 $ , the amount of '1' is $ 0 $ . '1' is a strict minority, thus all occurrences of it are removed from the substring. However, since there were $ 0 $ of them, nothing changes. Same for \"1\". And in \"01\" neither of '0' or '1' is a strict minority. Thus, nothing changes. So there is no way to remove any characters.\n\nIn the second testcase, you can choose substring \"10101010101\". It contains $ 5 $ characters '0' and $ 6 $ characters '1'. '0' is a strict minority. Thus, you can remove all its occurrences. There exist other substrings that produce the same answer.\n\nIn the third testcase, you can choose substring \"011000100\". It contains $ 6 $ characters '0' and $ 3 $ characters '1'. '1' is a strict minority. Thus, you can remove all its occurrences.",
