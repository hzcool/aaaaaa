    "description": "Bear Limak has $ n $ colored balls, arranged in one long row. Balls are numbered $ 1 $ through $ n $ , from left to right. There are $ n $ possible colors, also numbered $ 1 $ through $ n $ . The $ i $ -th ball has color $ t_{i} $ .\n\nFor a fixed interval (set of consecutive elements) of balls we can define a dominant color. It's a color occurring the biggest number of times in the interval. In case of a tie between some colors, the one with the smallest number (index) is chosen as dominant.\n\nThere are ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF643A/e72cbeaa17cceea137ec85134680a8c41a08d995.png) non-empty intervals in total. For each color, your task is to count the number of intervals in which this color is dominant.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=5000 $ ) \u2014 the number of balls.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n} $ ( $ 1<=t_{i}<=n $ ) where $ t_{i} $ is the color of the $ i $ -th ball.",
    "outputFormat": "Print $ n $ integers. The $ i $ -th of them should be equal to the number of intervals where $ i $ is a dominant color.",

    "hint": "In the first sample, color $ 2 $ is dominant in three intervals:\n\n- An interval $ [2,2] $ contains one ball. This ball's color is $ 2 $ so it's clearly a dominant color.\n- An interval $ [4,4] $ contains one ball, with color $ 2 $ again.\n- An interval $ [2,4] $ contains two balls of color $ 2 $ and one ball of color $ 1 $ .\n\nThere are $ 7 $ more intervals and color $ 1 $ is dominant in all of them.",
