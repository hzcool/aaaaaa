    "description": "Squirrel Liss is interested in sequences. She also has preferences of integers. She thinks $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ are good.\n\nNow she is interested in good sequences. A sequence $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{k} $ is called good if it satisfies the following three conditions:\n\n- The sequence is strictly increasing, i.e. $ x_{i}&lt;x_{i+1} $ for each $ i $ $ (1<=i<=k-1) $ .\n- No two adjacent elements are coprime, i.e. $ gcd(x_{i},x_{i+1})&gt;1 $ for each $ i $ $ (1<=i<=k-1) $ (where $ gcd(p,q) $ denotes the greatest common divisor of the integers $ p $ and $ q $ ).\n- All elements of the sequence are good integers.\n\nFind the length of the longest good sequence.",
