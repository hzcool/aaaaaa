    "description": "Every person likes prime numbers. Alice is a person, thus she also shares the love for them. Bob wanted to give her an affectionate gift but couldn't think of anything inventive. Hence, he will be giving her a graph. How original, Bob! Alice will surely be thrilled!\n\nWhen building the graph, he needs four conditions to be satisfied:\n\n- It must be a simple undirected graph, i.e. without multiple (parallel) edges and self-loops.\n- The number of vertices must be exactly $ n $ \u2014 a number he selected. This number is not necessarily prime.\n- The total number of edges must be prime.\n- The degree (i.e. the number of edges connected to the vertex) of each vertex must be prime.\n\nBelow is an example for $ n = 4 $ . The first graph (left one) is invalid as the degree of vertex $ 2 $ (and $ 4 $ ) equals to $ 1 $ , which is not prime. The second graph (middle one) is invalid as the total number of edges is $ 4 $ , which is not a prime number. The third graph (right one) is a valid answer for $ n = 4 $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1178D/3f451a0a015e85e0d9b919833cd5a0b4f7edb60b.png)Note that the graph can be disconnected.\n\nPlease help Bob to find any such graph!",

    "outputFormat": "If there is no graph satisfying the conditions, print a single line containing the integer $ -1 $ .\n\nOtherwise, first print a line containing a prime number $ m $ ( $ 2 \\leq m \\leq \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} $ ) \u2014 the number of edges in the graph. Then, print $ m $ lines, the $ i $ -th of which containing two integers $ u_i $ , $ v_i $ ( $ 1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n $ ) \u2014 meaning that there is an edge between vertices $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ . The degree of each vertex must be prime. There must be no multiple (parallel) edges or self-loops.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.\n\nNote that the graph can be disconnected.",

Additionally, the number of edges, $ 13 $ , is also a prime number, hence both conditions are satisfied.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1178D/44a2f5b9baacda9bf16e12d85f0a2a6d19c2b3cb.png)",
