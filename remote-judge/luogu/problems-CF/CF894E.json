    "description": "Ralph is going to collect mushrooms in the Mushroom Forest.\n\nThere are $ m $ directed paths connecting $ n $ trees in the Mushroom Forest. On each path grow some mushrooms. When Ralph passes a path, he collects all the mushrooms on the path. The Mushroom Forest has a magical fertile ground where mushrooms grow at a fantastic speed. New mushrooms regrow as soon as Ralph finishes mushroom collection on a path. More specifically, after Ralph passes a path the $ i $ -th time, there regrow $ i $ mushrooms less than there was before this pass. That is, if there is initially $ x $ mushrooms on a path, then Ralph will collect $ x $ mushrooms for the first time, $ x-1 $ mushrooms the second time, $ x-1-2 $ mushrooms the third time, and so on. However, the number of mushrooms can never be less than $ 0 $ .\n\nFor example, let there be $ 9 $ mushrooms on a path initially. The number of mushrooms that can be collected from the path is $ 9 $ , $ 8 $ , $ 6 $ and $ 3 $ when Ralph passes by from first to fourth time. From the fifth time and later Ralph can't collect any mushrooms from the path (but still can pass it).\n\nRalph decided to start from the tree $ s $ . How many mushrooms can he collect using only described paths?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{6} $ , $ 0<=m<=10^{6} $ ), representing the number of trees and the number of directed paths in the Mushroom Forest, respectively.\n\nEach of the following $ m $ lines contains three integers $ x $ , $ y $ and $ w $ ( $ 1<=x,y<=n $ , $ 0<=w<=10^{8} $ ), denoting a path that leads from tree $ x $ to tree $ y $ with $ w $ mushrooms initially. There can be paths that lead from a tree to itself, and multiple paths between the same pair of trees.\n\nThe last line contains a single integer $ s $ ( $ 1<=s<=n $ ) \u2014 the starting position of Ralph.",
