    "description": "Kristina has a string $ s $ of length $ n $ , consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. For each pair of lowercase letter and its matching uppercase letter, Kristina can get $ 1 $ burl. However, pairs of characters cannot overlap, so each character can only be in one pair.\n\nFor example, if she has the string $ s $ = \"aAaaBACacbE\", she can get a burl for the following character pairs:\n\n- $ s_1 $ = \"a\" and $ s_2 $ = \"A\"\n- $ s_4 $ = \"a\" and $ s_6 $ = \"A\"\n- $ s_5 $ = \"B\" and $ s_{10} $ = \"b\"\n- $ s_7 $ = \"C\" and $ s_9 $ = \"c\"\n\nKristina wants to get more burles for her string, so she is going to perform no more than $ k $ operations on it. In one operation, she can:\n\n- either select the lowercase character $ s_i $ ( $ 1 \\le i \\le n $ ) and make it uppercase.\n- or select uppercase character $ s_i $ ( $ 1 \\le i \\le n $ ) and make it lowercase.\n\nFor example, when $ k $ = 2 and $ s $ = \"aAaaBACacbE\" it can perform one operation: choose $ s_3 $ = \"a\" and make it uppercase. Then she will get another pair of $ s_3 $ = \"A\" and $ s_8 $ = \"a\"\n\nFind maximum number of burles Kristina can get for her string.",
