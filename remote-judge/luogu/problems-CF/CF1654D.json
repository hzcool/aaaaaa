    "description": "Alice's potion making professor gave the following assignment to his students: brew a potion using $ n $ ingredients, such that the proportion of ingredient $ i $ in the final potion is $ r_i > 0 $ (and $ r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n = 1 $ ).\n\nHe forgot the recipe, and now all he remembers is a set of $ n-1 $ facts of the form, \"ingredients $ i $ and $ j $ should have a ratio of $ x $ to $ y $ \" (i.e., if $ a_i $ and $ a_j $ are the amounts of ingredient $ i $ and $ j $ in the potion respectively, then it must hold $ a_i/a_j = x/y $ ), where $ x $ and $ y $ are positive integers. However, it is guaranteed that the set of facts he remembers is sufficient to uniquely determine the original values $ r_i $ .\n\nHe decided that he will allow the students to pass the class as long as they submit a potion which satisfies all of the $ n-1 $ requirements (there may be many such satisfactory potions), and contains a positive integer amount of each ingredient.\n\nFind the minimum total amount of ingredients needed to make a potion which passes the class. As the result can be very large, you should print the answer modulo $ 998\\,244\\,353 $ .",
