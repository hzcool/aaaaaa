    "description": "Ivan is a programming teacher. During the academic year, he plans to give $ n $ lectures on $ n $ different topics. Each topic should be used in exactly one lecture. Ivan wants to choose which topic will he explain during the $ 1 $ -st, $ 2 $ -nd, ..., $ n $ -th lecture \u2014 formally, he wants to choose some permutation of integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ (let's call this permutation $ q $ ). $ q_i $ is the index of the topic Ivan will explain during the $ i $ -th lecture.\n\nFor each topic (except exactly one), there exists a prerequisite topic (for the topic $ i $ , the prerequisite topic is $ p_i $ ). Ivan cannot give a lecture on a topic before giving a lecture on its prerequisite topic. There exists at least one valid ordering of topics according to these prerequisite constraints.\n\nOrdering the topics correctly can help students understand the lectures better. Ivan has $ k $ special pairs of topics $ (x_i, y_i) $ such that he knows that the students will understand the $ y_i $ -th topic better if the lecture on it is conducted right after the lecture on the $ x_i $ -th topic. Ivan wants to satisfy the constraints on every such pair, that is, for every $ i \\in [1, k] $ , there should exist some $ j \\in [1, n - 1] $ such that $ q_j = x_i $ and $ q_{j + 1} = y_i $ .\n\nNow Ivan wants to know if there exists an ordering of topics that satisfies all these constraints, and if at least one exists, find any of them.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5 $ , $ 1 \\le k \\le n - 1 $ ) \u2014 the number of topics and the number of special pairs of topics, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ p_1 $ , $ p_2 $ , ..., $ p_n $ ( $ 0 \\le p_i \\le n $ ), where $ p_i $ is the prerequisite topic for the topic $ i $ (or $ p_i = 0 $ if the $ i $ -th topic has no prerequisite topics). Exactly one of these integers is $ 0 $ . At least one ordering of topics such that for every $ i $ the $ p_i $ -th topic is placed before the $ i $ -th topic exists.\n\nThen $ k $ lines follow, the $ i $ -th line contains two integers $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ ( $ 1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n $ ; $ x_i \\ne y_i $ ) \u2014 the topics from the $ i $ -th special pair. All values of $ x_i $ are pairwise distinct; similarly, all valus of $ y_i $ are pairwise distinct.",
    "outputFormat": "If there is no ordering of topics meeting all the constraints, print $ 0 $ .\n\nOtherwise, print $ n $ pairwise distinct integers $ q_1 $ , $ q_2 $ , ..., $ q_n $ ( $ 1 \\le q_i \\le n $ ) \u2014 the ordering of topics meeting all of the constraints. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
