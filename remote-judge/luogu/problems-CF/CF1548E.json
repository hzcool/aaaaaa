    "description": "Two painters, Amin and Benj, are repainting Gregor's living room ceiling! The ceiling can be modeled as an $ n \\times m $ grid.\n\nFor each $ i $ between $ 1 $ and $ n $ , inclusive, painter Amin applies $ a_i $ layers of paint to the entire $ i $ -th row. For each $ j $ between $ 1 $ and $ m $ , inclusive, painter Benj applies $ b_j $ layers of paint to the entire $ j $ -th column. Therefore, the cell $ (i,j) $ ends up with $ a_i+b_j $ layers of paint.\n\nGregor considers the cell $ (i,j) $ to be badly painted if $ a_i+b_j \\le x $ . Define a badly painted region to be a maximal connected component of badly painted cells, i. e. a connected component of badly painted cells such that all adjacent to the component cells are not badly painted. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side.\n\nGregor is appalled by the state of the finished ceiling, and wants to know the number of badly painted regions.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ x $ ( $ 1 \\le n,m \\le 2\\cdot 10^5 $ , $ 1 \\le x \\le 2\\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the dimensions of Gregor's ceiling, and the maximum number of paint layers in a badly painted cell.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 2\\cdot 10^5 $ ), the number of paint layers Amin applies to each row.\n\nThe third line contains $ m $ integers $ b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m $ ( $ 1 \\le b_j \\le 2\\cdot 10^5 $ ), the number of paint layers Benj applies to each column.",
