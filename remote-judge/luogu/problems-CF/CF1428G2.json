    "description": "This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference is in the constraint on $ q $ . You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.\n\nZookeeper has been teaching his $ q $ sheep how to write and how to add. The $ i $ -th sheep has to write exactly $ k $ non-negative integers with the sum $ n_i $ .\n\nStrangely, sheep have superstitions about digits and believe that the digits $ 3 $ , $ 6 $ , and $ 9 $ are lucky. To them, the fortune of a number depends on the decimal representation of the number; the fortune of a number is equal to the sum of fortunes of its digits, and the fortune of a digit depends on its value and position and can be described by the following table. For example, the number $ 319 $ has fortune $ F_{2} + 3F_{0} $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1428G2/2e5dc16252276b0ec85d4bf61f3eff843360d5df.png)Each sheep wants to maximize the sum of fortune among all its $ k $ written integers.
