    "description": "A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles.\n\nYou are given a tree of $ n $ vertices. Find the number of ways to choose exactly $ k $ vertices in this tree (i. e. a $ k $ -element subset of vertices) so that all pairwise distances between the selected vertices are equal (in other words, there exists an integer $ c $ such that for all $ u, v $ ( $ u \\ne v $ , $ u, v $ are in selected vertices) $ d_{u,v}=c $ , where $ d_{u,v} $ is the distance from $ u $ to $ v $ ).\n\nSince the answer may be very large, you need to output it modulo $ 10^9 + 7 $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $ t $ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case is preceded by an empty line.\n\nEach test case consists of several lines. The first line of the test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 2 \\le k \\le n \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree and the number of vertices to be selected, respectively. Then $ n - 1 $ lines follow, each of them contains two integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1 \\le u, v \\le n $ , $ u \\neq v $ ) which describe a pair of vertices connected by an edge. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree and has no loops or multiple edges.",
