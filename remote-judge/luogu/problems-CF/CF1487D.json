    "description": "A Pythagorean triple is a triple of integer numbers $ (a, b, c) $ such that it is possible to form a right triangle with the lengths of the first cathetus, the second cathetus and the hypotenuse equal to $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ , respectively. An example of the Pythagorean triple is $ (3, 4, 5) $ .\n\nVasya studies the properties of right triangles, and he uses a formula that determines if some triple of integers is Pythagorean. Unfortunately, he has forgotten the exact formula; he remembers only that the formula was some equation with squares. So, he came up with the following formula: $ c = a^2 - b $ .\n\nObviously, this is not the right formula to check if a triple of numbers is Pythagorean. But, to Vasya's surprise, it actually worked on the triple $ (3, 4, 5) $ : $ 5 = 3^2 - 4 $ , so, according to Vasya's formula, it is a Pythagorean triple.\n\nWhen Vasya found the right formula (and understood that his formula is wrong), he wondered: how many are there triples of integers $ (a, b, c) $ with $ 1 \\le a \\le b \\le c \\le n $ such that they are Pythagorean both according to his formula and the real definition? He asked you to count these triples.",
