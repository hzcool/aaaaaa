    "description": "Andrewid the Android is a galaxy-known detective. Now he is preparing a defense against a possible attack by hackers on a major computer network.\n\nIn this network are $ n $ vertices, some pairs of vertices are connected by $ m $ undirected channels. It is planned to transfer $ q $ important messages via this network, the $ i $ -th of which must be sent from vertex $ s_{i} $ to vertex $ d_{i} $ via one or more channels, perhaps through some intermediate vertices.\n\nTo protect against attacks a special algorithm was developed. Unfortunately it can be applied only to the network containing directed channels. Therefore, as new channels can't be created, it was decided for each of the existing undirected channels to enable them to transmit data only in one of the two directions.\n\nYour task is to determine whether it is possible so to choose the direction for each channel so that each of the $ q $ messages could be successfully transmitted.",

Between a pair of nodes can exist more than one channel.\n\nNext $ q $ lines contain two integers $ s_{i} $ and $ d_{i} $ ( $ 1<=s_{i},d_{i}<=n $ , $ s_{i}\u2260d_{i} $ ) \u2014 the numbers of the nodes of the source and destination of the corresponding message.\n\nIt is not guaranteed that in it initially possible to transmit all the messages.",
