    "description": "Eudokimus, a system administrator is in trouble again. As a result of an error in some script, a list of names of very important files has been damaged. Since they were files in the BerFS file system, it is known that each file name has a form \"name.ext\", where:\n\n- name is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, its length is from 1 to 8 characters;\n- ext is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, its length is from 1 to 3 characters.\n\nFor example, \"read.me\", \"example.txt\" and \"b.cpp\" are valid file names and \"version.info\", \"ntldr\" and \"contestdata.zip\" are not.\n\nDamage to the list meant that all the file names were recorded one after another, without any separators. So now Eudokimus has a single string.\n\nEudokimus needs to set everything right as soon as possible. He should divide the resulting string into parts so that each part would be a valid file name in BerFS. Since Eudokimus has already proved that he is not good at programming, help him. The resulting file list can contain the same file names.",
    "inputFormat": "The input data consists of a single string $ s $ , its length is from $ 1 $ to $ 4\u00b710^{5} $ characters. The string can contain only lowercase Latin letters ('a' - 'z') and periods ('.').",
    "outputFormat": "In the first line print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if it is possible to divide $ s $ into parts as required. In this case, the following lines should contain the parts of the required partition, one per line in the order in which they appear in $ s $ . The required partition can contain the same file names. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nIf the solution does not exist, then print in a single line \"NO\" (without the quotes).",
