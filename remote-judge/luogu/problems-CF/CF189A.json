    "description": "Polycarpus has a ribbon, its length is $ n $ . He wants to cut the ribbon in a way that fulfils the following two conditions:\n\n- After the cutting each ribbon piece should have length $ a $ , $ b $ or $ c $ .\n- After the cutting the number of ribbon pieces should be maximum.\n\nHelp Polycarpus and find the number of ribbon pieces after the required cutting.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains four space-separated integers $ n $ , $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ $ (1<=n,a,b,c<=4000) $ \u2014 the length of the original ribbon and the acceptable lengths of the ribbon pieces after the cutting, correspondingly. The numbers $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ can coincide.",
    "outputFormat": "Print a single number \u2014 the maximum possible number of ribbon pieces. It is guaranteed that at least one correct ribbon cutting exists.",
