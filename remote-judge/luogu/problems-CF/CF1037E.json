On each morning, two of them, who were not friends before, become friends.\n\nWe want to plan a trip for every evening of $ m $ days. On each trip, you have to select a group of people that will go on the trip. For every person, one of the following should hold:\n\n- Either this person does not go on the trip,\n- Or at least $ k $ of his friends also go on the trip.\n\nNote that the friendship is not transitive. That is, if $ a $ and $ b $ are friends and $ b $ and $ c $ are friends, it does not necessarily imply that $ a $ and $ c $ are friends.\n\nFor each day, find the maximum number of people that can go on the trip on that day.",
