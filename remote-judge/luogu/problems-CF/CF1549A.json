    "description": "Gregor is learning about RSA cryptography, and although he doesn't understand how RSA works, he is now fascinated with prime numbers and factoring them.\n\nGregor's favorite prime number is $ P $ . Gregor wants to find two bases of $ P $ . Formally, Gregor is looking for two integers $ a $ and $ b $ which satisfy both of the following properties.\n\n- $ P \\bmod a = P \\bmod b $ , where $ x \\bmod y $ denotes the remainder when $ x $ is divided by $ y $ , and\n- $ 2 \\le a < b \\le P $ .\n\nHelp Gregor find two bases of his favorite prime number!",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 1000 $ ).\n\nEach subsequent line contains the integer $ P $ ( $ 5 \\le P \\le {10}^9 $ ), with $ P $ guaranteed to be prime.",
    "outputFormat": "Your output should consist of $ t $ lines. Each line should consist of two integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 2 \\le a < b \\le P $ ). If there are multiple possible solutions, print any.",

        [

        ]
    ],
    "hint": "The first query is $ P=17 $ . $ a=3 $ and $ b=5 $ are valid bases in this case, because $ 17 \\bmod 3 = 17 \\bmod 5 = 2 $ . There are other pairs which work as well.\n\nIn the second query, with $ P=5 $ , the only solution is $ a=2 $ and $ b=4 $ .",
