    "description": "In this problem at each moment you have a set of intervals. You can move from interval $ (a,b) $ from our set to interval $ (c,d) $ from our set if and only if $ c&lt;a&lt;d $ or $ c&lt;b&lt;d $ . Also there is a path from interval $ I_{1} $ from our set to interval $ I_{2} $ from our set if there is a sequence of successive moves starting from $ I_{1} $ so that we can reach $ I_{2} $ .\n\nYour program should handle the queries of the following two types:\n\n1. \"1 x y\" $ (x&lt;y) $ \u2014 add the new interval $ (x,y) $ to the set of intervals. The length of the new interval is guaranteed to be strictly greater than all the previous intervals.\n2. \"2 a b\" $ (a\u2260b) $ \u2014 answer the question: is there a path from $ a $ -th (one-based) added interval to $ b $ -th (one-based) added interval?\n\nAnswer all the queries. Note, that initially you have an empty set of intervals.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains integer $ n $ denoting the number of queries, $ (1<=n<=100) $ . Each of the following lines contains a query as described above. All numbers in the input are integers and don't exceed $ 10^{9} $ by their absolute value.\n\nIt's guaranteed that all queries are correct.",
    "outputFormat": "For each query of the second type print \"YES\" or \"NO\" on a separate line depending on the answer.",
