    "description": "We often go to supermarkets to buy some fruits or vegetables, and on the tag there prints the price for a kilo. But in some supermarkets, when asked how much the items are, the clerk will say that $ a $ yuan for $ b $ kilos (You don't need to care about what \"yuan\" is), the same as $ a/b $ yuan for a kilo.\n\nNow imagine you'd like to buy $ m $ kilos of apples. You've asked $ n $ supermarkets and got the prices. Find the minimum cost for those apples.\n\nYou can assume that there are enough apples in all supermarkets.",

Each line contains two positive integers $ a,b $ ( $ 1<=a,b<=100 $ ), denoting that in this supermarket, you are supposed to pay $ a $ yuan for $ b $ kilos of apples.",
