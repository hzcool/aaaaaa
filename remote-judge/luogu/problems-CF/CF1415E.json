    "description": "Wabbit is playing a game with $ n $ bosses numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The bosses can be fought in any order. Each boss needs to be defeated exactly once. There is a parameter called boss bonus which is initially $ 0 $ .\n\nWhen the $ i $ -th boss is defeated, the current boss bonus is added to Wabbit's score, and then the value of the boss bonus increases by the point increment $ c_i $ . Note that $ c_i $ can be negative, which means that other bosses now give fewer points.\n\nHowever, Wabbit has found a glitch in the game. At any point in time, he can reset the playthrough and start a New Game Plus playthrough. This will set the current boss bonus to $ 0 $ , while all defeated bosses remain defeated. The current score is also saved and does not reset to zero after this operation. This glitch can be used at most $ k $ times. He can reset after defeating any number of bosses (including before or after defeating all of them), and he also can reset the game several times in a row without defeating any boss.\n\nHelp Wabbit determine the maximum score he can obtain if he has to defeat all $ n $ bosses.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two spaced integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5 $ , $ 0 \\leq k \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5 $ ), representing the number of bosses and the number of resets allowed.\n\nThe next line of input contains $ n $ spaced integers $ c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_n $ ( $ -10^6 \\leq c_i \\leq 10^6 $ ), the point increments of the $ n $ bosses.",
    "outputFormat": "Output a single integer, the maximum score Wabbit can obtain by defeating all $ n $ bosses (this value may be negative).",

    "hint": "In the first test case, no resets are allowed. An optimal sequence of fights would be\n\n- Fight the first boss $ (+0) $ . Boss bonus becomes equal to $ 1 $ .\n- Fight the second boss $ (+1) $ . Boss bonus becomes equal to $ 2 $ .\n- Fight the third boss $ (+2) $ . Boss bonus becomes equal to $ 3 $ .\n\nThus the answer for the first test case is $ 0+1+2=3 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that one possible optimal sequence of fights is\n\n- Fight the fifth boss $ (+0) $ . Boss bonus becomes equal to $ 5 $ .\n- Fight the first boss $ (+5) $ . Boss bonus becomes equal to $ 4 $ .\n- Fight the second boss $ (+4) $ . Boss bonus becomes equal to $ 2 $ .\n- Fight the third boss $ (+2) $ . Boss bonus becomes equal to $ -1 $ .\n- Reset. Boss bonus becomes equal to $ 0 $ .\n- Fight the fourth boss $ (+0) $ . Boss bonus becomes equal to $ -4 $ .\n\nHence the answer for the second test case is $ 0+5+4+2+0=11 $ .",
