If the chip is currently at a point $ (x,y) $ , after a second it moves to the point $ (x-1,y) $ with probability $ p_{1} $ , to the point $ (x,y-1) $ with probability $ p_{2} $ , to the point $ (x+1,y) $ with probability $ p_{3} $ and to the point $ (x,y+1) $ with probability $ p_{4} $ . It's guaranteed that $ p_{1}+p_{2}+p_{3}+p_{4}=1 $ . The moves are independent.\n\nFind out the expected time after which chip will move away from origin at a distance greater than $ R $ (i.e. ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF963E/246aa7b086b7ae016d999e705d5862993be04853.png) will be satisfied).",
