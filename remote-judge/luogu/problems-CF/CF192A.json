    "description": "As you very well know, this year's funkiest numbers are so called triangular numbers (that is, integers that are representable as ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF192A/b7835ec12be1f62e2540332b68d58fb7ebe6c923.png), where $ k $ is some positive integer), and the coolest numbers are those that are representable as a sum of two triangular numbers.\n\nA well-known hipster Andrew adores everything funky and cool but unfortunately, he isn't good at maths. Given number $ n $ , help him define whether this number can be represented by a sum of two triangular numbers (not necessarily different)!",
