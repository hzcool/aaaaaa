    "description": "ZS the Coder has a large tree. It can be represented as an undirected connected graph of $ n $ vertices numbered from $ 0 $ to $ n-1 $ and $ n-1 $ edges between them. There is a single nonzero digit written on each edge.\n\nOne day, ZS the Coder was bored and decided to investigate some properties of the tree. He chose a positive integer $ M $ , which is coprime to $ 10 $ , i.e. ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF715C/9b5bdec4cb6231baa1f3fcb57eb25703ae0eed8f.png).\n\nZS consider an ordered pair of distinct vertices $ (u,v) $ interesting when if he would follow the shortest path from vertex $ u $ to vertex $ v $ and write down all the digits he encounters on his path in the same order, he will get a decimal representaion of an integer divisible by $ M $ .\n\nFormally, ZS consider an ordered pair of distinct vertices $ (u,v) $ interesting if the following states true:\n\n- Let $ a_{1}=u,a_{2},...,a_{k}=v $ be the sequence of vertices on the shortest path from $ u $ to $ v $ in the order of encountering them;\n- Let $ d_{i} $ ( $ 1<=i&lt;k $ ) be the digit written on the edge between vertices $ a_{i} $ and $ a_{i+1} $ ;\n- The integer ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF715C/72be647436ef167ccaba4334e08ad71c22afc6b4.png) is divisible by $ M $ .\n\nHelp ZS the Coder find the number of interesting pairs!",
