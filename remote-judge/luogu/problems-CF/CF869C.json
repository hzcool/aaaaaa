    "description": "\u2014 This is not playing but duty as allies of justice, Nii-chan!\n\n\u2014 Not allies but justice itself, Onii-chan!\n\nWith hands joined, go everywhere at a speed faster than our thoughts! This time, the Fire Sisters \u2014 Karen and Tsukihi \u2014 is heading for somewhere they've never reached \u2014 water-surrounded islands!\n\nThere are three clusters of islands, conveniently coloured red, blue and purple. The clusters consist of $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ distinct islands respectively.\n\nBridges have been built between some (possibly all or none) of the islands. A bridge bidirectionally connects two different islands and has length $ 1 $ . For any two islands of the same colour, either they shouldn't be reached from each other through bridges, or the shortest distance between them is at least $ 3 $ , apparently in order to prevent oddities from spreading quickly inside a cluster.\n\nThe Fire Sisters are ready for the unknown, but they'd also like to test your courage. And you're here to figure out the number of different ways to build all bridges under the constraints, and give the answer modulo $ 998244353 $ . Two ways are considered different if a pair of islands exist, such that there's a bridge between them in one of them, but not in the other.",
