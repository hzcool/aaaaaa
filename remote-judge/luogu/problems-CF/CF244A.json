    "description": "One day Ms Swan bought an orange in a shop. The orange consisted of $ n\u00b7k $ segments, numbered with integers from 1 to $ n\u00b7k $ .\n\nThere were $ k $ children waiting for Ms Swan at home. The children have recently learned about the orange and they decided to divide it between them. For that each child took a piece of paper and wrote the number of the segment that he would like to get: the $ i $ -th $ (1<=i<=k) $ child wrote the number $ a_{i} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=n\u00b7k) $ . All numbers $ a_{i} $ accidentally turned out to be different.\n\nNow the children wonder, how to divide the orange so as to meet these conditions:\n\n- each child gets exactly $ n $ orange segments;\n- the $ i $ -th child gets the segment with number $ a_{i} $ for sure;\n- no segment goes to two children simultaneously.\n\nHelp the children, divide the orange and fulfill the requirements, described above.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ , $ k $ $ (1<=n,k<=30) $ . The second line contains $ k $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{k} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=n\u00b7k) $ , where $ a_{i} $ is the number of the orange segment that the $ i $ -th child would like to get.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all numbers $ a_{i} $ are distinct.",
    "outputFormat": "Print exactly $ n\u00b7k $ distinct integers. The first $ n $ integers represent the indexes of the segments the first child will get, the second $ n $ integers represent the indexes of the segments the second child will get, and so on. Separate the printed numbers with whitespaces.\n\nYou can print a child's segment indexes in any order. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists. If there are multiple correct answers, print any of them.",
