    "description": "There are $ n $ cities in the country.\n\nTwo candidates are fighting for the post of the President. The elections are set in the future, and both candidates have already planned how they are going to connect the cities with roads. Both plans will connect all cities using $ n - 1 $ roads only. That is, each plan can be viewed as a tree. Both of the candidates had also specified their choice of the capital among $ n $ cities ( $ x $ for the first candidate and $ y $ for the second candidate), which may or may not be same.\n\nEach city has a potential of building a port (one city can have at most one port). Building a port in $ i $ -th city brings $ a_i $ amount of money. However, each candidate has his specific demands. The demands are of the form:\n\n- $ k $ $ x $ , which means that the candidate wants to build exactly $ x $ ports in the subtree of the $ k $ -th city of his tree (the tree is rooted at the capital of his choice).\n\nFind out the maximum revenue that can be gained while fulfilling all demands of both candidates, or print -1 if it is not possible to do.\n\nIt is additionally guaranteed, that each candidate has specified the port demands for the capital of his choice.",
