The value $ (j-i+1) $ denotes the length of the subsegment.\n\nYour task is to find the longest subsegment of $ a $ , such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.\n\nYou only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.",
