    "description": "Nazar, a student of the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland, is known for his outstanding mathematical abilities. Today a math teacher gave him a very difficult task.\n\nConsider two infinite sets of numbers. The first set consists of odd positive numbers ( $ 1, 3, 5, 7, \\ldots $ ), and the second set consists of even positive numbers ( $ 2, 4, 6, 8, \\ldots $ ). At the first stage, the teacher writes the first number on the endless blackboard from the first set, in the second stage \u2014 the first two numbers from the second set, on the third stage \u2014 the next four numbers from the first set, on the fourth \u2014 the next eight numbers from the second set and so on. In other words, at each stage, starting from the second, he writes out two times more numbers than at the previous one, and also changes the set from which these numbers are written out to another.\n\nThe ten first written numbers: $ 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 6, 8, 10 $ . Let's number the numbers written, starting with one.\n\nThe task is to find the sum of numbers with numbers from $ l $ to $ r $ for given integers $ l $ and $ r $ . The answer may be big, so you need to find the remainder of the division by $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^9+7 $ ).\n\nNazar thought about this problem for a long time, but didn't come up with a solution. Help him solve this problem.",
