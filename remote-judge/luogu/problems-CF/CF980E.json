    "description": "The nation of Panel holds an annual show called The Number Games, where each district in the nation will be represented by one contestant.\n\nThe nation has $ n $ districts numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , each district has exactly one path connecting it to every other district. The number of fans of a contestant from district $ i $ is equal to $ 2^i $ .\n\nThis year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $ k $ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts.\n\nThe president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.\n\nWhich contestants should the president remove?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6 $ ) \u2014 the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.\n\nThe next $ n-1 $ lines each contains two integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1 \\leq a, b \\leq n $ , $ a \\ne b $ ), that describe a road that connects two different districts $ a $ and $ b $ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.",
