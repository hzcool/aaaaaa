    "description": "An oriented weighted forest is an acyclic weighted digraph in which from each vertex at most one edge goes.\n\nThe root of vertex $ v $ of an oriented weighted forest is a vertex from which no edge goes and which can be reached from vertex $ v $ moving along the edges of the weighted oriented forest. We denote the root of vertex $ v $ as $ root(v) $ .\n\nThe depth of vertex $ v $ is the sum of weights of paths passing from the vertex $ v $ to its root. Let's denote the depth of the vertex $ v $ as $ depth(v) $ .\n\nLet's consider the process of constructing a weighted directed forest. Initially, the forest does not contain vertices. Vertices are added sequentially one by one. Overall, there are $ n $ performed operations of adding. The $ i $ -th $ (i&gt;0) $ adding operation is described by a set of numbers $ (k,v_{1},x_{1},v_{2},x_{2},...\\ ,v_{k},x_{k}) $ and means that we should add vertex number $ i $ and $ k $ edges to the graph: an edge from vertex $ root(v_{1}) $ to vertex $ i $ with weight $ depth(v_{1})+x_{1} $ , an edge from vertex $ root(v_{2}) $ to vertex $ i $ with weight $ depth(v_{2})+x_{2} $ and so on. If $ k=0 $ , then only vertex $ i $ is added to the graph, there are no added edges.\n\nYour task is like this: given the operations of adding vertices, calculate the sum of the weights of all edges of the forest, resulting after the application of all defined operations, modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ \u2014 the number of operations of adding a vertex.\n\nNext $ n $ lines contain descriptions of the operations, the $ i $ -th line contains the description of the operation of adding the $ i $ -th vertex in the following format: the first number of a line is an integer $ k $ $ (0<=k<=i-1) $ , then follow $ 2k $ space-separated integers: $ v_{1},x_{1},v_{2},x_{2},...\\ ,v_{k},x_{k} $ $ (1<=v_{j}<=i-1,|x_{j}|<=10^{9}) $ .\n\nThe operations are given in the order, in which they should be applied to the graph. It is guaranteed that sum $ k $ of all operations does not exceed $ 10^{5} $ , also that applying operations of adding vertexes does not result in loops and multiple edges.",
