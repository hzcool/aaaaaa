    "description": "ZS the Coder is coding on a crazy computer. If you don't type in a word for a $ c $ consecutive seconds, everything you typed disappear!\n\nMore formally, if you typed a word at second $ a $ and then the next word at second $ b $ , then if $ b-a<=c $ , just the new word is appended to other words on the screen. If $ b-a&gt;c $ , then everything on the screen disappears and after that the word you have typed appears on the screen.\n\nFor example, if $ c=5 $ and you typed words at seconds $ 1,3,8,14,19,20 $ then at the second $ 8 $ there will be $ 3 $ words on the screen. After that, everything disappears at the second $ 13 $ because nothing was typed. At the seconds $ 14 $ and $ 19 $ another two words are typed, and finally, at the second $ 20 $ , one more word is typed, and a total of $ 3 $ words remain on the screen.\n\nYou're given the times when ZS the Coder typed the words. Determine how many words remain on the screen after he finished typing everything.",
