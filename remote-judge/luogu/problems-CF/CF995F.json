    "description": "Allen, having graduated from the MOO Institute of Techcowlogy (MIT), has started a startup! Allen is the president of his startup. He also hires $ n-1 $ other employees, each of which is assigned a direct superior. If $ u $ is a superior of $ v $ and $ v $ is a superior of $ w $ then also $ u $ is a superior of $ w $ . Additionally, there are no $ u $ and $ v $ such that $ u $ is the superior of $ v $ and $ v $ is the superior of $ u $ . Allen himself has no superior. Allen is employee number $ 1 $ , and the others are employee numbers $ 2 $ through $ n $ .\n\nFinally, Allen must assign salaries to each employee in the company including himself. Due to budget constraints, each employee's salary is an integer between $ 1 $ and $ D $ . Additionally, no employee can make strictly more than his superior.\n\nHelp Allen find the number of ways to assign salaries. As this number may be large, output it modulo $ 10^9 + 7 $ .",
