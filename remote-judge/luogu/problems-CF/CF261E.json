    "description": "Maxim has got a calculator. The calculator has two integer cells. Initially, the first cell contains number $ 1 $ , and the second cell contains number $ 0 $ . In one move you can perform one of the following operations:\n\n1. Let's assume that at the current time the first cell contains number $ a $ , and the second cell contains number $ b $ . Write to the second cell number $ b+1 $ ;\n2. Let's assume that at the current time the first cell contains number $ a $ , and the second cell contains number $ b $ . Write to the first cell number $ a\u00b7b $ .\n\nMaxim is wondering, how many integers $ x $ $ (l<=x<=r) $ are there, such that we can write the number $ x $ to the first cell of the calculator, having performed at most $ p $ moves.",
