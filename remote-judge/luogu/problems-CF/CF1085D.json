    "description": "You are given a tree (an undirected connected graph without cycles) and an integer $ s $ .\n\nVanya wants to put weights on all edges of the tree so that all weights are non-negative real numbers and their sum is $ s $ . At the same time, he wants to make the diameter of the tree as small as possible.\n\nLet's define the diameter of a weighed tree as the maximum sum of the weights of the edges lying on the path between two some vertices of the tree. In other words, the diameter of a weighed tree is the length of the longest simple path in the tree, where length of a path is equal to the sum of weights over all edges in the path.\n\nFind the minimum possible diameter that Vanya can get.",

The edges are undirected.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.",
