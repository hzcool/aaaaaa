    "description": "We've got no test cases. A big olympiad is coming up. But the problemsetters' number one priority should be adding another problem to the round.\n\nThe diameter of a multiset of points on the line is the largest distance between two points from this set. For example, the diameter of the multiset $ {1,3,2,1} $ is 2.\n\nDiameter of multiset consisting of one point is 0.\n\nYou are given $ n $ points on the line. What is the minimum number of points you have to remove, so that the diameter of the multiset of the remaining points will not exceed $ d $ ?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ d $ ( $ 1<=n<=100,0<=d<=100 $ ) \u2014 the amount of points and the maximum allowed diameter respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ space separated integers ( $ 1<=x_{i}<=100 $ ) \u2014 the coordinates of the points.",
    "outputFormat": "Output a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of points you have to remove.",

    "hint": "In the first test case the optimal strategy is to remove the point with coordinate $ 4 $ . The remaining points will have coordinates $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ , so the diameter will be equal to $ 2-1=1 $ .\n\nIn the second test case the diameter is equal to $ 0 $ , so its is unnecessary to remove any points.\n\nIn the third test case the optimal strategy is to remove points with coordinates $ 1 $ , $ 9 $ and $ 10 $ . The remaining points will have coordinates $ 3 $ , $ 4 $ and $ 6 $ , so the diameter will be equal to $ 6-3=3 $ .",
