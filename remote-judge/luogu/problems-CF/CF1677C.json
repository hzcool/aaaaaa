    "description": "Tokitsukaze has two colorful tapes. There are $ n $ distinct colors, numbered $ 1 $ through $ n $ , and each color appears exactly once on each of the two tapes. Denote the color of the $ i $ -th position of the first tape as $ ca_i $ , and the color of the $ i $ -th position of the second tape as $ cb_i $ .\n\nNow Tokitsukaze wants to select each color an integer value from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , distinct for all the colors. After that she will put down the color values in each colored position on the tapes. Denote the number of the $ i $ -th position of the first tape as $ numa_i $ , and the number of the $ i $ -th position of the second tape as $ numb_i $ .\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1677C/ba8639f69fd74760b5261096016619c105b9cbe6.png)For example, for the above picture, assuming that the color red has value $ x $ ( $ 1 \\leq x \\leq n $ ), it appears at the $ 1 $ -st position of the first tape and the $ 3 $ -rd position of the second tape, so $ numa_1=numb_3=x $ .\n\nNote that each color $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ should have a distinct value, and the same color which appears in both tapes has the same value.\n\nAfter labeling each color, the beauty of the two tapes is calculated as $ $$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|numa_i-numb_i|. $ $$$\n\nPlease help Tokitsukaze to find the highest possible beauty.",
