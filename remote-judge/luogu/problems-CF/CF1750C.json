    "description": "You have two binary strings $ a $ and $ b $ of length $ n $ . You would like to make all the elements of both strings equal to $ 0 $ . Unfortunately, you can modify the contents of these strings using only the following operation:\n\n- You choose two indices $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n $ );\n- For every $ i $ that respects $ l \\le i \\le r $ , change $ a_i $ to the opposite. That is, $ a_i := 1 - a_i $ ;\n- For every $ i $ that respects either $ 1 \\le i < l $ or $ r < i \\le n $ , change $ b_i $ to the opposite. That is, $ b_i := 1 - b_i $ .\n\nYour task is to determine if this is possible, and if it is, to find such an appropriate chain of operations. The number of operations should not exceed $ n + 5 $ . It can be proven that if such chain of operations exists, one exists with at most $ n + 5 $ operations.",

The description of test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the length of the strings.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a binary string $ a $ , consisting only of characters 0 and 1, of length $ n $ .\n\nThe third line of each test case contains a binary string $ b $ , consisting only of characters 0 and 1, of length $ n $ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that sum of $ n $ over all test cases doesn't exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print first \"YES\" if it's possible to make all the elements of both strings equal to $ 0 $ . Otherwise, print \"NO\". If the answer is \"YES\", on the next line print a single integer $ k $ ( $ 0 \\le k \\le n + 5 $ ) \u2014 the number of operations. Then $ k $ lines follows, each contains two integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n $ ) \u2014 the description of the operation.\n\nIf there are several correct answers, print any of them.",

Then we perform an operation with $ l = 2 $ and $ r = 2 $ , then $ a_2 := 1 - 1 = 0 $ and $ b_1 = 1 - 1 = 0 $ . So both of string $ a $ and $ b $ became equal to 00.\n\nIn the fifth test case, we can perform an operation with $ l = 1 $ and $ r = 1 $ . Then string $ a $ became equal to 011 and string $ b $ became equal to 100. Then we can perform an operation with $ l = 2 $ and $ r = 3 $ , so both of string $ a $ and $ b $ became equal to 000.",
