Not only that, but the bookstore has begun charging extortionate prices for some books. Namely, whereas in the previous versions each book could be bought for 1 CHF, now the price of book $ i $ is $ c_{i} $ CHF.",

The second line will contain $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=n $ ) \u2013 the sequence of book requests. The third line contains $ n $ integers $ c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n} $ ( $ 0<=c_{i}<=10^{6} $ ) \u2013 the costs of the books.",
