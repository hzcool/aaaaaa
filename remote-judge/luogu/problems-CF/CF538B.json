    "description": "A number is called quasibinary if its decimal representation contains only digits 0 or 1. For example, numbers 0, 1, 101, 110011 \u2014 are quasibinary and numbers 2, 12, 900 are not.\n\nYou are given a positive integer $ n $ . Represent it as a sum of minimum number of quasibinary numbers.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{6} $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "In the first line print a single integer $ k $ \u2014 the minimum number of numbers in the representation of number $ n $ as a sum of quasibinary numbers.\n\nIn the second line print $ k $ numbers \u2014 the elements of the sum. All these numbers should be quasibinary according to the definition above, their sum should equal $ n $ . Do not have to print the leading zeroes in the numbers. The order of numbers doesn't matter. If there are multiple possible representations, you are allowed to print any of them.",
