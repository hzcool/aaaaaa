Let's denote the number with index $ i $ as $ a_{i} $ .\n\nThe Little Elephant wants to count, how many pairs of integers $ l $ and $ r $ are there, such that $ 1<=l&lt;r<=n $ and sequence $ b=a_{1}a_{2}...\\ a_{l}a_{r}a_{r+1}...\\ a_{n} $ has no more than $ k $ inversions.\n\nAn inversion in sequence $ b $ is a pair of elements of the sequence $ b $ , that change their relative order after a stable sorting of the sequence. In other words, an inversion is a pair of integers $ i $ and $ j $ , such that $ 1<=i&lt;j<=|b| $ and $ b_{i}&gt;b_{j} $ , where $ |b| $ is the length of sequence $ b $ , and $ b_{j} $ is its $ j $ -th element.\n\nHelp the Little Elephant and count the number of the described pairs.",
