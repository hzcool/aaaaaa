    "description": "String $ x $ is an anagram of string $ y $ , if we can rearrange the letters in string $ x $ and get exact string $ y $ . For example, strings \"DOG\" and \"GOD\" are anagrams, so are strings \"BABA\" and \"AABB\", but strings \"ABBAC\" and \"CAABA\" are not.\n\nYou are given two strings $ s $ and $ t $ of the same length, consisting of uppercase English letters. You need to get the anagram of string $ t $ from string $ s $ . You are permitted to perform the replacing operation: every operation is replacing some character from the string $ s $ by any other character. Get the anagram of string $ t $ in the least number of replacing operations. If you can get multiple anagrams of string $ t $ in the least number of operations, get the lexicographically minimal one.\n\nThe lexicographic order of strings is the familiar to us \"dictionary\" order. Formally, the string $ p $ of length $ n $ is lexicographically smaller than string $ q $ of the same length, if $ p_{1}=q_{1} $ , $ p_{2}=q_{2} $ , ..., $ p_{k-1}=q_{k-1} $ , $ p_{k}&lt;q_{k} $ for some $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n $ ). Here characters in the strings are numbered from 1. The characters of the strings are compared in the alphabetic order.",
    "inputFormat": "The input consists of two lines. The first line contains string $ s $ , the second line contains string $ t $ . The strings have the same length (from $ 1 $ to $ 10^{5} $ characters) and consist of uppercase English letters.",
    "outputFormat": "In the first line print $ z $ \u2014 the minimum number of replacement operations, needed to get an anagram of string $ t $ from string $ s $ . In the second line print the lexicographically minimum anagram that could be obtained in $ z $ operations.",

    "hint": "The second sample has eight anagrams of string $ t $ , that can be obtained from string $ s $ by replacing exactly two letters: \"ADBADC\", \"ADDABC\", \"CDAABD\", \"CDBAAD\", \"CDBADA\", \"CDDABA\", \"DDAABC\", \"DDBAAC\". These anagrams are listed in the lexicographical order. The lexicographically minimum anagram is \"ADBADC\".",
