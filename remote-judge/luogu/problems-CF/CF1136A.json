    "description": "After lessons Nastya decided to read a book. The book contains $ n $ chapters, going one after another, so that one page of the book belongs to exactly one chapter and each chapter contains at least one page.\n\nYesterday evening Nastya did not manage to finish reading the book, so she marked the page with number $ k $ as the first page which was not read (i.e. she read all pages from the $ 1 $ -st to the $ (k-1) $ -th).\n\nThe next day Nastya's friend Igor came and asked her, how many chapters remain to be read by Nastya? Nastya is too busy now, so she asks you to compute the number of chapters she has not completely read yet (i.e. the number of chapters she has not started to read or has finished reading somewhere in the middle).",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of chapters in the book.\n\nThere are $ n $ lines then. The $ i $ -th of these lines contains two integers $ l_i $ , $ r_i $ separated by space ( $ l_1 = 1 $ , $ l_i \\leq r_i $ ) \u2014 numbers of the first and the last pages of the $ i $ -th chapter. It's guaranteed that $ l_{i+1} = r_i + 1 $ for all $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n-1 $ , and also that every chapter contains at most $ 100 $ pages.\n\nThe $ (n+2) $ -th line contains a single integer $ k $ ( $ 1 \\leq k \\leq r_n $ ) \u2014 the index of the marked page.",

Nastya marked the $ 2 $ -nd page, so she finished in the middle of the $ 1 $ -st chapter.
