    "description": "The only difference between easy and hard versions is the length of the string. You can hack this problem if you solve it. But you can hack the previous problem only if you solve both problems.\n\nKirk has a binary string $ s $ (a string which consists of zeroes and ones) of length $ n $ and he is asking you to find a binary string $ t $ of the same length which satisfies the following conditions:\n\n- For any $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n $ ) the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the substring $ s_{l}s_{l+1} \\ldots s_{r} $ is equal to the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the substring $ t_{l}t_{l+1} \\ldots t_{r} $ ;\n- The number of zeroes in $ t $ is the maximum possible.\n\nA non-decreasing subsequence of a string $ p $ is a sequence of indices $ i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_k $ such that $ i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_k $ and $ p_{i_1} \\leq p_{i_2} \\leq \\ldots \\leq p_{i_k} $ . The length of the subsequence is $ k $ .\n\nIf there are multiple substrings which satisfy the conditions, output any.",
