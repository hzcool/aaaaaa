    "description": "Pavel plays a famous computer game. A player is responsible for a whole country and he can travel there freely, complete quests and earn experience.\n\nThis country has $ n $ cities connected by $ m $ bidirectional roads of different lengths so that it is possible to get from any city to any other one. There are portals in $ k $ of these cities. At the beginning of the game all portals are closed. When a player visits a portal city, the portal opens. Strange as it is, one can teleport from an open portal to an open one. The teleportation takes no time and that enables the player to travel quickly between rather remote regions of the country.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Pavel is in city number $ 1 $ . He wants to open all portals as quickly as possible. How much time will he need for that?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ , $ 0<=m<=10^{5} $ ) that show how many cities and roads are in the game.\n\nEach of the next $ m $ lines contains the description of a road as three space-separated integers $ x_{i} $ , $ y_{i} $ , $ w_{i} $ ( $ 1<=x_{i},y_{i}<=n $ , $ x_{i}\u2260y_{i} $ , $ 1<=w_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the numbers of the cities connected by the $ i $ -th road and the time needed to go from one city to the other one by this road. Any two cities are connected by no more than one road. It is guaranteed that we can get from any city to any other one, moving along the roads of the country.\n\nThe next line contains integer $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n $ ) \u2014 the number of portals.\n\nThe next line contains $ k $ space-separated integers $ p_{1} $ , $ p_{2} $ , ..., $ p_{k} $ \u2014 numbers of the cities with installed portals. Each city has no more than one portal.",
    "outputFormat": "Print a single number \u2014 the minimum time a player needs to open all portals.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.",
