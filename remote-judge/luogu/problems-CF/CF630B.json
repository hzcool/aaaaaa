    "description": "The city administration of IT City decided to fix up a symbol of scientific and technical progress in the city's main square, namely an indicator board that shows the effect of Moore's law in real time.\n\nMoore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every $ 24 $ months. The implication of Moore's law is that computer performance as function of time increases exponentially as well.\n\nYou are to prepare information that will change every second to display on the indicator board. Let's assume that every second the number of transistors increases exactly $ 1.000000011 $ times.",
