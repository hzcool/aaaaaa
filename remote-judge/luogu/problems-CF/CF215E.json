    "description": "A non-empty string $ s $ is called binary, if it consists only of characters \"0\" and \"1\". Let's number the characters of binary string $ s $ from 1 to the string's length and let's denote the $ i $ -th character in string $ s $ as $ s_{i} $ .\n\nBinary string $ s $ with length $ n $ is periodical, if there is an integer $ 1<=k&lt;n $ such that:\n\n- $ k $ is a divisor of number $ n $\n- for all $ 1<=i<=n-k $ , the following condition fulfills: $ s_{i}=s_{i+k} $\n\nFor example, binary strings \"101010\" and \"11\" are periodical and \"10\" and \"10010\" are not.\n\nA positive integer $ x $ is periodical, if its binary representation (without leading zeroes) is a periodic string.\n\nYour task is to calculate, how many periodic numbers are in the interval from $ l $ to $ r $ (both ends are included).",
