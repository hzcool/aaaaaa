    "description": "Matryoshka is a wooden toy in the form of a painted doll, inside which you can put a similar doll of a smaller size.\n\nA set of nesting dolls contains one or more nesting dolls, their sizes are consecutive positive integers. Thus, a set of nesting dolls is described by two numbers: $ s $ \u2014 the size of a smallest nesting doll in a set and $ m $ \u2014 the number of dolls in a set. In other words, the set contains sizes of $ s, s + 1, \\dots, s + m - 1 $ for some integer $ s $ and $ m $ ( $ s,m > 0 $ ).\n\nYou had one or more sets of nesting dolls. Recently, you found that someone mixed all your sets in one and recorded a sequence of doll sizes \u2014 integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ .\n\nYou do not remember how many sets you had, so you want to find the minimum number of sets that you could initially have.\n\nFor example, if a given sequence is $ a=[2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1] $ . Initially, there could be $ 2 $ sets:\n\n- the first set consisting of $ 4 $ nesting dolls with sizes $ [1, 2, 3, 4] $ ;\n- a second set consisting of $ 2 $ nesting dolls with sizes $ [2, 3] $ .\n\nAccording to a given sequence of sizes of nesting dolls $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ , determine the minimum number of nesting dolls that can make this sequence.\n\nEach set is completely used, so all its nesting dolls are used. Each element of a given sequence must correspond to exactly one doll from some set.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input data contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the total number of matryoshkas that were in all sets.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ) \u2014 the sizes of the matryoshkas.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of values of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2\\cdot10^5 $ .",
