    "description": "The sequence of integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k $ is called a good array if $ a_1 = k - 1 $ and $ a_1 > 0 $ . For example, the sequences $ [3, -1, 44, 0], [1, -99] $ are good arrays, and the sequences $ [3, 7, 8], [2, 5, 4, 1], [0] $ \u2014 are not.\n\nA sequence of integers is called good if it can be divided into a positive number of good arrays. Each good array should be a subsegment of sequence and each element of the sequence should belong to exactly one array. For example, the sequences $ [2, -3, 0, 1, 4] $ , $ [1, 2, 3, -3, -9, 4] $ are good, and the sequences $ [2, -3, 0, 1] $ , $ [1, 2, 3, -3 -9, 4, 1] $ \u2014 are not.\n\nFor a given sequence of numbers, count the number of its subsequences that are good sequences, and print the number of such subsequences modulo 998244353.",
