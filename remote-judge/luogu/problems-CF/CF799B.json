Each of the t-shirts is characterized by three integers $ p_{i} $ , $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ , where $ p_{i} $ is the price of the $ i $ -th t-shirt, $ a_{i} $ is front color of the $ i $ -th t-shirt and $ b_{i} $ is back color of the $ i $ -th t-shirt. All values $ p_{i} $ are distinct, and values $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ are integers from $ 1 $ to $ 3 $ .\n\n $ m $ buyers will come to the shop. Each of them wants to buy exactly one t-shirt. For the $ j $ -th buyer we know his favorite color $ c_{j} $ .\n\nA buyer agrees to buy a t-shirt, if at least one side (front or back) is painted in his favorite color. Among all t-shirts that have colors acceptable to this buyer he will choose the cheapest one. If there are no such t-shirts, the buyer won't buy anything. Assume that the buyers come one by one, and each buyer is served only after the previous one is served.\n\nYou are to compute the prices each buyer will pay for t-shirts.",
