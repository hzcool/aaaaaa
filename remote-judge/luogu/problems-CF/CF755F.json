    "description": "It's Christmas time! PolandBall and his friends will be giving themselves gifts. There are $ n $ Balls overall. Each Ball has someone for whom he should bring a present according to some permutation $ p $ , $ p_{i}\u2260i $ for all $ i $ .\n\nUnfortunately, Balls are quite clumsy. We know earlier that exactly $ k $ of them will forget to bring their gift. A Ball number $ i $ will get his present if the following two constraints will hold:\n\n1. Ball number $ i $ will bring the present he should give.\n2. Ball $ x $ such that $ p_{x}=i $ will bring his present.\n\nWhat is minimum and maximum possible number of kids who will not get their present if exactly $ k $ Balls will forget theirs?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{6} $ , $ 0<=k<=n $ ), representing the number of Balls and the number of Balls who will forget to bring their presents.\n\nThe second line contains the permutation $ p $ of integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , where $ p_{i} $ is the index of Ball who should get a gift from the $ i $ -th Ball. For all $ i $ , $ p_{i}\u2260i $ holds.",
    "outputFormat": "You should output two values \u2014 minimum and maximum possible number of Balls who will not get their presents, in that order.",

    "hint": "In the first sample, if the third and the first balls will forget to bring their presents, they will be th only balls not getting a present. Thus the minimum answer is $ 2 $ . However, if the first ans the second balls will forget to bring their presents, then only the fifth ball will get a present. So, the maximum answer is $ 4 $ .",
