What's the minimum number of elements you can delete to make the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) of the array non-zero?\n\nA bitwise AND is a binary operation that takes two equal-length binary representations and performs the AND operation on each pair of the corresponding bits.",

However, after deleting $ 1 $ (or $ 2 $ ), the array becomes $ [2] $ (or $ [1] $ ), and the bitwise AND becomes $ 2 $ (or $ 1 $ ). This can be proven to be the optimal, so the answer is $ 1 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, the array is $ [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] $ . Currently, the bitwise AND is $ 0 $ . However, after deleting $ 4 $ , $ 5 $ , and $ 8 $ , the array becomes $ [2, 3, 6, 7] $ , and the bitwise AND becomes $ 2 $ . This can be proven to be the optimal, so the answer is $ 3 $ .
