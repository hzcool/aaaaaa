    "description": "Little penguin Polo has got a tree \u2014 a non-directed connected acyclic graph, containing $ n $ nodes and $ n-1 $ edges. We will consider the tree nodes numbered by integers from 1 to $ n $ .\n\nToday Polo wonders, how to find the number of pairs of paths that don't have common nodes. More formally, he should find the number of groups of four integers $ a,b,c $ and $ d $ such that:\n\n- $ 1<=a&lt;b<=n $ ;\n- $ 1<=c&lt;d<=n $ ;\n- there's no such node that lies on both the shortest path from node $ a $ to node $ b $ and from node $ c $ to node $ d $ .\n\nThe shortest path betweem two nodes is the path that is shortest in the number of edges.\n\nHelp Polo solve this problem.",
