    "description": "DZY loves colors, and he enjoys painting.\n\nOn a colorful day, DZY gets a colorful ribbon, which consists of $ n $ units (they are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from left to right). The color of the $ i $ -th unit of the ribbon is $ i $ at first. It is colorful enough, but we still consider that the colorfulness of each unit is $ 0 $ at first.\n\nDZY loves painting, we know. He takes up a paintbrush with color $ x $ and uses it to draw a line on the ribbon. In such a case some contiguous units are painted. Imagine that the color of unit $ i $ currently is $ y $ . When it is painted by this paintbrush, the color of the unit becomes $ x $ , and the colorfulness of the unit increases by $ |x-y| $ .\n\nDZY wants to perform $ m $ operations, each operation can be one of the following:\n\n1. Paint all the units with numbers between $ l $ and $ r $ (both inclusive) with color $ x $ .\n2. Ask the sum of colorfulness of the units between $ l $ and $ r $ (both inclusive).\n\nCan you help DZY?",
