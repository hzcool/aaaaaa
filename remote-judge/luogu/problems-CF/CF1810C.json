    "description": "You have an integer array $ a $ of length $ n $ . There are two kinds of operations you can make.\n\n- Remove an integer from $ a $ . This operation costs $ c $ .\n- Insert an arbitrary positive integer $ x $ to any position of $ a $ (to the front, to the back, or between any two consecutive elements). This operation costs $ d $ .\n\nYou want to make the final array a permutation of any positive length. Please output the minimum cost of doing that. Note that you can make the array empty during the operations, but the final array must contain at least one integer.\n\nA permutation of length $ n $ is an array consisting of $ n $ distinct integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in arbitrary order. For example, $ [2,3,1,5,4] $ is a permutation, but $ [1,2,2] $ is not a permutation ( $ 2 $ appears twice in the array), and $ [1,3,4] $ is also not a permutation ( $ n=3 $ but there is $ 4 $ in the array).",

Their description follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $ n $ , $ c $ , $ d $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 10^5 $ , $ 1 \\le c,d \\le 10^9 $ ).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n} $ ( $ 1 \\le a_{i} \\le 10^9 $ ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",

    "hint": "In the first test case, the array is already a permutation, so there's no need for operations.\n\nIn the second test case, we can remove numbers $ 5 $ , $ 6 $ to get the permutation $ [1,2,3] $ in cost $ 2 $ . Note that we can also get a permutation by inserting a number $ 4 $ , but it costs $ 5 $ .\n\nIn the third test case, we can just remove all the numbers except for the first number $ 1 $ . It costs $ 8 $ , and the final array is $ [1] $ , which is a permutation of length $ 1 $ .\n\nIn the fourth test case, we can remove all the numbers except for $ 2 $ , and insert a number $ 1 $ to the first position. It costs $ 4+10=14 $ , and the final array is $ [1,2] $ , which is a permutation of length $ 2 $ .",
