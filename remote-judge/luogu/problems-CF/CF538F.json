    "description": "Andrew skipped lessons on the subject 'Algorithms and Data Structures' for the entire term. When he came to the final test, the teacher decided to give him a difficult task as a punishment.\n\nThe teacher gave Andrew an array of $ n $ numbers $ a_{1} $ , $ ... $ , $ a_{n} $ . After that he asked Andrew for each $ k $ from 1 to $ n-1 $ to build a $ k $ -ary heap on the array and count the number of elements for which the property of the minimum-rooted heap is violated, i.e. the value of an element is less than the value of its parent.\n\nAndrew looked up on the Wikipedia that a $ k $ -ary heap is a rooted tree with vertices in elements of the array. If the elements of the array are indexed from 1 to $ n $ , then the children of element $ v $ are elements with indices $ k(v-1)+2 $ , $ ... $ , $ kv+1 $ (if some of these elements lie outside the borders of the array, the corresponding children are absent). In any $ k $ -ary heap every element except for the first one has exactly one parent; for the element 1 the parent is absent (this element is the root of the heap). Denote $ p(v) $ as the number of the parent of the element with the number $ v $ . Let's say that for a non-root element $ v $ the property of the heap is violated if $ a_{v}&lt;a_{p(v)} $ .\n\nHelp Andrew cope with the task!",
