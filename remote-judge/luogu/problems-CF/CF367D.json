    "description": "Sereja has $ m $ non-empty sets of integers $ A_{1},A_{2},...,A_{m} $ . What a lucky coincidence! The given sets are a partition of the set of all integers from 1 to $ n $ . In other words, for any integer $ v $ $ (1<=v<=n) $ there is exactly one set $ A_{t} $ such that ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF367D/3f8a940400a40d5f76505a83349ff53839519434.png). Also Sereja has integer $ d $ .\n\nSereja decided to choose some sets from the sets he has. Let's suppose that $ i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{k} $ $ (1<=i_{1}&lt;i_{2}&lt;...&lt;i_{k}<=m) $ are indexes of the chosen sets. Then let's define an array of integers $ b $ , sorted in ascending order, as a union of the chosen sets, that is, ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF367D/99f78eca4a538d2f0ed7359631dcfed20f0ac14e.png). We'll represent the element with number $ j $ in this array (in ascending order) as $ b_{j} $ . Sereja considers his choice of sets correct, if the following conditions are met:\n\n $ b_{1}<=d;\u00a0b_{i+1}-b_{i}<=d\u00a0(1<=i&lt;|b|);\u00a0n-d+1<=b_{|b|}. $ Sereja wants to know what is the minimum number of sets $ (k) $ that he can choose so that his choice will be correct. Help him with that.",
