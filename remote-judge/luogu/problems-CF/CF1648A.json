    "description": "Egor has a table of size $ n \\times m $ , with lines numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ and columns numbered from $ 1 $ to $ m $ . Each cell has a color that can be presented as an integer from $ 1 $ to $ 10^5 $ .\n\nLet us denote the cell that lies in the intersection of the $ r $ -th row and the $ c $ -th column as $ (r, c) $ . We define the manhattan distance between two cells $ (r_1, c_1) $ and $ (r_2, c_2) $ as the length of a shortest path between them where each consecutive cells in the path must have a common side. The path can go through cells of any color. For example, in the table $ 3 \\times 4 $ the manhattan distance between $ (1, 2) $ and $ (3, 3) $ is $ 3 $ , one of the shortest paths is the following: $ (1, 2) \\to (2, 2) \\to (2, 3) \\to (3, 3) $ .\n\nEgor decided to calculate the sum of manhattan distances between each pair of cells of the same color. Help him to calculate this sum.",
