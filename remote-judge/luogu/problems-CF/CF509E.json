    "description": "When Sasha was studying in the seventh grade, he started listening to music a lot. In order to evaluate which songs he likes more, he introduced the notion of the song's prettiness. The title of the song is a word consisting of uppercase Latin letters. The prettiness of the song is the prettiness of its title.\n\nLet's define the simple prettiness of a word as the ratio of the number of vowels in the word to the number of all letters in the word.\n\nLet's define the prettiness of a word as the sum of simple prettiness of all the substrings of the word.\n\nMore formally, let's define the function $ vowel(c) $ which is equal to $ 1 $ , if $ c $ is a vowel, and to $ 0 $ otherwise. Let $ s_{i} $ be the $ i $ -th character of string $ s $ , and $ s_{i..j} $ be the substring of word $ s $ , staring at the $ i $ -th character and ending at the $ j $ -th character ( $ s_{is}_{i+1}...\\ s_{j} $ , $ i<=j $ ).\n\nThen the simple prettiness of $ s $ is defined by the formula:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF509E/8a2dbee4b1c33aa895831fc2fe122715758cf953.png)The prettiness of $ s $ equals\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF509E/3fb2ca96d46f7dd52fd9c1d5aedeb338d9a977cb.png)Find the prettiness of the given song title.\n\nWe assume that the vowels are $ I,E,A,O,U,Y $ .",
