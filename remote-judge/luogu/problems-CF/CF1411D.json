    "description": "Currently, XXOC's rap is a string consisting of zeroes, ones, and question marks. Unfortunately, haters gonna hate. They will write $ x $ angry comments for every occurrence of subsequence 01 and $ y $ angry comments for every occurrence of subsequence 10. You should replace all the question marks with 0 or 1 in such a way that the number of angry comments would be as small as possible.\n\nString $ b $ is a subsequence of string $ a $ , if it can be obtained by removing some characters from $ a $ . Two occurrences of a subsequence are considered distinct if sets of positions of remaining characters are distinct.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains string $ s $ \u2014 XXOC's rap ( $ 1 \\le |s| \\leq 10^5 $ ). The second line contains two integers $ x $ and $ y $ \u2014 the number of angry comments XXOC will recieve for every occurrence of 01 and 10 accordingly ( $ 0 \\leq x, y \\leq 10^6 $ ).",
    "outputFormat": "Output a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of angry comments.",
