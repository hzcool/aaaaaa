    "description": "Bessie and the cows have recently been playing with \"cool\" sequences and are trying to construct some. Unfortunately they are bad at arithmetic, so they need your help!\n\nA pair $ (x,y) $ of positive integers is \"cool\" if $ x $ can be expressed as the sum of $ y $ consecutive integers (not necessarily positive). A sequence $ (a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}) $ is \"cool\" if the pairs $ (a_{1},a_{2}),(a_{2},a_{3}),...,(a_{n-1},a_{n}) $ are all cool.\n\nThe cows have a sequence of $ n $ positive integers, $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . In one move, they may replace some $ a_{i} $ with any other positive integer (there are no other limits on the new value of $ a_{i} $ ). Determine the smallest number of moves needed to make the resulting sequence cool.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer, $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=5000 $ ). The next line contains $ n $ space-separated integers, $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{15} $ ).\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.",
    "outputFormat": "A single integer, the minimum number of $ a_{i} $ that must be changed to make the sequence cool.",

        [

    ],
    "hint": "In the first sample, the sequence is already cool, so we don't need to change any elements. In the second sample, we can change $ a_{2} $ to 5 and $ a_{3} $ to 10 to make (20, 5, 10, 4) which is cool. This changes 2 elements.",
