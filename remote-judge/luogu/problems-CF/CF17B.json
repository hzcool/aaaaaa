    "description": "Nick's company employed $ n $ people. Now Nick needs to build a tree hierarchy of \u00absupervisor-surbodinate\u00bb relations in the company (this is to say that each employee, except one, has exactly one supervisor). There are $ m $ applications written in the following form: \u00abemployee $ a_{i} $ is ready to become a supervisor of employee $ b_{i} $ at extra cost $ c_{i} $ \u00bb. The qualification $ q_{j} $ of each employee is known, and for each application the following is true: $ q_{ai}>q_{bi} $ .\n\nWould you help Nick calculate the minimum cost of such a hierarchy, or find out that it is impossible to build it.",
    "inputFormat": "The first input line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ ) \u2014 amount of employees in the company. The following line contains $ n $ space-separated numbers $ q_{j} $ ( $ 0<=q_{j}<=10^{6} $ )\u2014 the employees' qualifications. The following line contains number $ m $ ( $ 0<=m<=10000 $ ) \u2014 amount of received applications. The following $ m $ lines contain the applications themselves, each of them in the form of three space-separated numbers: $ a_{i} $ , $ b_{i} $ and $ c_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n $ , $ 0<=c_{i}<=10^{6} $ ). Different applications can be similar, i.e. they can come from one and the same employee who offered to become a supervisor of the same person but at a different cost. For each application $ q_{ai}>q_{bi} $ .",
