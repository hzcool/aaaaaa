    "description": "Two famous competing companies ChemForces and TopChemist decided to show their sets of recently discovered chemical elements on an exhibition. However they know that no element should be present in the sets of both companies.\n\nIn order to avoid this representatives of both companies decided to make an agreement on the sets the companies should present. The sets should be chosen in the way that maximizes the total income of the companies.\n\nAll elements are enumerated with integers. The ChemForces company has discovered $ n $ distinct chemical elements with indices $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ , and will get an income of $ x_i $ Berland rubles if the $ i $ -th element from this list is in the set of this company.\n\nThe TopChemist company discovered $ m $ distinct chemical elements with indices $ b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m $ , and it will get an income of $ y_j $ Berland rubles for including the $ j $ -th element from this list to its set.\n\nIn other words, the first company can present any subset of elements from $ \\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\\} $ (possibly empty subset), the second company can present any subset of elements from $ \\{b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m\\} $ (possibly empty subset). There shouldn't be equal elements in the subsets.\n\nHelp the representatives select the sets in such a way that no element is presented in both sets and the total income is the maximum possible.",
