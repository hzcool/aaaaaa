    "description": "There are some rabbits in Singapore Zoo. To feed them, Zookeeper bought $ n $ carrots with lengths $ a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_n $ . However, rabbits are very fertile and multiply very quickly. Zookeeper now has $ k $ rabbits and does not have enough carrots to feed all of them. To solve this problem, Zookeeper decided to cut the carrots into $ k $ pieces. For some reason, all resulting carrot lengths must be positive integers.\n\nBig carrots are very difficult for rabbits to handle and eat, so the time needed to eat a carrot of size $ x $ is $ x^2 $ .\n\nHelp Zookeeper split his carrots while minimizing the sum of time taken for rabbits to eat the carrots.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ $ (1 \\leq n \\leq k \\leq 10^5) $ : the initial number of carrots and the number of rabbits.\n\nThe next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ $ (1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^6) $ : lengths of carrots.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ a_i $ is at least $ k $ .",
