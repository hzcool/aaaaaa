    "description": "In one well-known algorithm of finding the $ k $ -th order statistics we should divide all elements into groups of five consecutive elements and find the median of each five. A median is called the middle element of a sorted array (it's the third largest element for a group of five). To increase the algorithm's performance speed on a modern video card, you should be able to find a sum of medians in each five of the array.\n\nA sum of medians of a sorted $ k $ -element set $ S={a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{k}} $ , where $ a_{1}&lt;a_{2}&lt;a_{3}&lt;...&lt;a_{k} $ , will be understood by as\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF85D/ade3397df6e8978ddadfc100b4ccb88beefd1e3f.png)The ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF85D/99fd5677ca5c02520be7595d9b1eaf3e9972e601.png) operator stands for taking the remainder, that is ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF85D/cb1d84ad58154eb7ea26b65d1ae0039570db9bb6.png) stands for the remainder of dividing $ x $ by $ y $ .\n\nTo organize exercise testing quickly calculating the sum of medians for a changing set was needed.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains number $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ), the number of operations performed.\n\nThen each of $ n $ lines contains the description of one of the three operations:\n\n- add $ x $  \u2014 add the element $ x $ to the set;\n- del $ x $  \u2014 delete the element $ x $ from the set;\n- sum \u2014 find the sum of medians of the set.\n\nFor any add $ x $  operation it is true that the element $ x $ is not included in the set directly before the operation.\n\nFor any del $ x $  operation it is true that the element $ x $ is included in the set directly before the operation.\n\nAll the numbers in the input are positive integers, not exceeding $ 10^{9} $ .",
