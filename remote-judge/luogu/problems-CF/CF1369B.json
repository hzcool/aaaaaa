    "description": "Lee was cleaning his house for the party when he found a messy string under the carpets. Now he'd like to make it clean accurately and in a stylish way...\n\nThe string $ s $ he found is a binary string of length $ n $ (i. e. string consists only of 0-s and 1-s).\n\nIn one move he can choose two consecutive characters $ s_i $ and $ s_{i+1} $ , and if $ s_i $ is 1 and $ s_{i + 1} $ is 0, he can erase exactly one of them (he can choose which one to erase but he can't erase both characters simultaneously). The string shrinks after erasing.\n\nLee can make an arbitrary number of moves (possibly zero) and he'd like to make the string $ s $ as clean as possible. He thinks for two different strings $ x $ and $ y $ , the shorter string is cleaner, and if they are the same length, then the lexicographically smaller string is cleaner.\n\nNow you should answer $ t $ test cases: for the $ i $ -th test case, print the cleanest possible string that Lee can get by doing some number of moves.\n\nSmall reminder: if we have two strings $ x $ and $ y $ of the same length then $ x $ is lexicographically smaller than $ y $ if there is a position $ i $ such that $ x_1 = y_1 $ , $ x_2 =       y_2 $ ,..., $ x_{i - 1} = y_{i - 1} $ and $ x_i < y_i $ .",

The string $ s $ is a string of length $ n $ which consists only of zeroes and ones.\n\nIt's guaranteed that sum of $ n $ over test cases doesn't exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
