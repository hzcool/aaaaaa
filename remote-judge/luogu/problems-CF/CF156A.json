    "description": "Dr. Moriarty is about to send a message to Sherlock Holmes. He has a string $ s $ .\n\nString $ p $ is called a substring of string $ s $ if you can read it starting from some position in the string $ s $ . For example, string \"aba\" has six substrings: \"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aba\".\n\nDr. Moriarty plans to take string $ s $ and cut out some substring from it, let's call it $ t $ . Then he needs to change the substring $ t $ zero or more times. As a result, he should obtain a fixed string $ u $ (which is the string that should be sent to Sherlock Holmes). One change is defined as making one of the following actions:\n\n- Insert one letter to any end of the string.\n- Delete one letter from any end of the string.\n- Change one letter into any other one.\n\nMoriarty is very smart and after he chooses some substring $ t $ , he always makes the minimal number of changes to obtain $ u $ .\n\nHelp Moriarty choose the best substring $ t $ from all substrings of the string $ s $ . The substring $ t $ should minimize the number of changes Moriarty should make to obtain the string $ u $ from it.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a non-empty string $ s $ , consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The second line contains a non-empty string $ u $ , consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The lengths of both strings are in the range from $ 1 $ to $ 2000 $ , inclusive.",
    "outputFormat": "Print the only integer \u2014 the minimum number of changes that Dr. Moriarty has to make with the string that you choose.",

        ]
    ],
    "hint": "In the first sample Moriarty can take any substring of length $ 3 $ , and it will be equal to the required message $ u $ , so Moriarty won't have to make any changes.\n\nIn the second sample you should take a substring consisting of characters from second to fourth (\"bca\") or from fifth to sixth (\"bc\"). Then you will only have to make one change: to change or to add the last character.\n\nIn the third sample the initial string $ s $ doesn't contain any character that the message should contain, so, whatever string you choose, you will have to make at least $ 7 $ changes to obtain the required message.",
