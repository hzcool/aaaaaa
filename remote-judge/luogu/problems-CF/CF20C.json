    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5},0<=m<=10^{5} $ ), where $ n $ is the number of vertices and $ m $ is the number of edges. Following $ m $ lines contain one edge each in form $ a_{i} $ , $ b_{i} $ and $ w_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n,1<=w_{i}<=10^{6} $ ), where $ a_{i},b_{i} $ are edge endpoints and $ w_{i} $ is the length of the edge.\n\nIt is possible that the graph has loops and multiple edges between pair of vertices.",
