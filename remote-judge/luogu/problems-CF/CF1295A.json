    "description": "You have a large electronic screen which can display up to $ 998244353 $ decimal digits. The digits are displayed in the same way as on different electronic alarm clocks: each place for a digit consists of $ 7 $ segments which can be turned on and off to compose different digits. The following picture describes how you can display all $ 10 $ decimal digits:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1295A/f1bf3e3ee1e01404b7c2f218b7a8b65c071d6967.png)\n\nAs you can see, different digits may require different number of segments to be turned on. For example, if you want to display $ 1 $ , you have to turn on $ 2 $ segments of the screen, and if you want to display $ 8 $ , all $ 7 $ segments of some place to display a digit should be turned on.\n\nYou want to display a really large integer on the screen. Unfortunately, the screen is bugged: no more than $ n $ segments can be turned on simultaneously. So now you wonder what is the greatest integer that can be displayed by turning on no more than $ n $ segments.\n\nYour program should be able to process $ t $ different test cases.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 100 $ ) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input.\n\nThen the test cases follow, each of them is represented by a separate line containing one integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \\le n \\le 10^5 $ ) \u2014 the maximum number of segments that can be turned on in the corresponding testcase.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases in the input does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the greatest integer that can be displayed by turning on no more than $ n $ segments of the screen. Note that the answer may not fit in the standard $ 32 $ -bit or $ 64 $ -bit integral data type.",
