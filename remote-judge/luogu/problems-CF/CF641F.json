    "description": "Little Artem is a very smart programmer. He knows many different difficult algorithms. Recently he has mastered in 2-SAT one.\n\nIn computer science, 2-satisfiability (abbreviated as 2-SAT) is the special case of the problem of determining whether a conjunction (logical AND) of disjunctions (logical OR) have a solution, in which all disjunctions consist of no more than two arguments (variables). For the purpose of this problem we consider only 2-SAT formulas where each disjunction consists of exactly two arguments.\n\nConsider the following 2-SAT problem as an example: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF641F/668de4b7e3b5177b51ec0e425d95844b629806be.png). Note that there might be negations in 2-SAT formula (like for $ x_{1} $ and for $ x_{4} $ ).\n\nArtem now tries to solve as many problems with 2-SAT as possible. He found a very interesting one, which he can not solve yet. Of course, he asks you to help him.\n\nThe problem is: given two 2-SAT formulas $ f $ and $ g $ , determine whether their sets of possible solutions are the same. Otherwise, find any variables assignment $ x $ such that $ f(x)\u2260g(x) $ .",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains three integers $ n $ , $ m_{1} $ and $ m_{2} $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ , $ 1<=m_{1},m_{2}<=n^{2} $ ) \u2014 the number of variables, the number of disjunctions in the first formula and the number of disjunctions in the second formula, respectively.\n\nNext $ m_{1} $ lines contains the description of 2-SAT formula $ f $ . The description consists of exactly $ m_{1} $ pairs of integers $ x_{i} $ ( $ -n<=x_{i}<=n,x_{i}\u22600 $ ) each on separate line, where $ x_{i}&gt;0 $ corresponds to the variable without negation, while $ x_{i}&lt;0 $ corresponds to the variable with negation. Each pair gives a single disjunction. Next $ m_{2} $ lines contains formula $ g $ in the similar format.",
