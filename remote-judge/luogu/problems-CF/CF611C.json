    "description": "They say \"years are like dominoes, tumbling one after the other\". But would a year fit into a grid? I don't think so.\n\nLimak is a little polar bear who loves to play. He has recently got a rectangular grid with $ h $ rows and $ w $ columns. Each cell is a square, either empty (denoted by '.') or forbidden (denoted by '\\#'). Rows are numbered $ 1 $ through $ h $ from top to bottom. Columns are numbered $ 1 $ through $ w $ from left to right.\n\nAlso, Limak has a single domino. He wants to put it somewhere in a grid. A domino will occupy exactly two adjacent cells, located either in one row or in one column. Both adjacent cells must be empty and must be inside a grid.\n\nLimak needs more fun and thus he is going to consider some queries. In each query he chooses some rectangle and wonders, how many way are there to put a single domino inside of the chosen rectangle?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers $ h $ and $ w $ ( $ 1<=h,w<=500 $ ) \u2013 the number of rows and the number of columns, respectively.\n\nThe next $ h $ lines describe a grid. Each line contains a string of the length $ w $ . Each character is either '.' or '\\#' \u2014 denoting an empty or forbidden cell, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=100000 $ ) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nEach of the next $ q $ lines contains four integers $ r1_{i} $ , $ c1_{i} $ , $ r2_{i} $ , $ c2_{i} $ ( $ 1<=r1_{i}<=r2_{i}<=h,1<=c1_{i}<=c2_{i}<=w $ ) \u2014 the $ i $ -th query. Numbers $ r1_{i} $ and $ c1_{i} $ denote the row and the column (respectively) of the upper left cell of the rectangle. Numbers $ r2_{i} $ and $ c2_{i} $ denote the row and the column (respectively) of the bottom right cell of the rectangle.",
