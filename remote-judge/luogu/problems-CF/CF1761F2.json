    "description": "This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is the constraint on $ n $ . You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.\n\nLet's call an array $ a $ of odd length $ 2m+1 $ (with $ m \\ge 1 $ ) bad, if element $ a_{m+1} $ is equal to the median of this array. In other words, the array is bad if, after sorting it, the element at $ m+1 $ -st position remains the same.\n\nLet's call a permutation $ p $ of integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ anti-median, if every its subarray of odd length $ \\ge 3 $ is not bad.\n\nYou are already given values of some elements of the permutation. Find the number of ways to set unknown values to obtain an anti-median permutation. As this number can be very large, find it modulo $ 10^9+7 $ .",
