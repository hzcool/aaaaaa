    "description": "Polycarp knows that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by $ 3 $ , then the number itself is divisible by $ 3 $ . He assumes that the numbers, the sum of the digits of which is divisible by $ 4 $ , are also somewhat interesting. Thus, he considers a positive integer $ n $ interesting if its sum of digits is divisible by $ 4 $ .\n\nHelp Polycarp find the nearest larger or equal interesting number for the given number $ a $ . That is, find the interesting number $ n $ such that $ n \\ge a $ and $ n $ is minimal.",
