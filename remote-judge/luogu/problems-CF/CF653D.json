    "description": "Niwel is a little golden bear. As everyone knows, bears live in forests, but Niwel got tired of seeing all the trees so he decided to move to the city.\n\nIn the city, Niwel took on a job managing bears to deliver goods. The city that he lives in can be represented as a directed graph with $ n $ nodes and $ m $ edges. Each edge has a weight capacity. A delivery consists of a bear carrying weights with their bear hands on a simple path from node $ 1 $ to node $ n $ . The total weight that travels across a particular edge must not exceed the weight capacity of that edge.\n\nNiwel has exactly $ x $ bears. In the interest of fairness, no bear can rest, and the weight that each bear carries must be exactly the same. However, each bear may take different paths if they like.\n\nNiwel would like to determine, what is the maximum amount of weight he can deliver (it's the sum of weights carried by bears). Find the maximum weight.",

This represents a directed edge from node $ a_{i} $ to $ b_{i} $ with weight capacity $ c_{i} $ . There are no self loops and no multiple edges from one city to the other city. More formally, for each $ i $ and $ j $ that $ i\u2260j $ it's guaranteed that $ a_{i}\u2260a_{j} $ or $ b_{i}\u2260b_{j} $ . It is also guaranteed that there is at least one path from node 1 to node $ n $ .",
