    "description": "Furik and Rubik take part in a relay race. The race will be set up on a large square with the side of $ n $ meters. The given square is split into $ n\u00d7n $ cells (represented as unit squares), each cell has some number.\n\nAt the beginning of the race Furik stands in a cell with coordinates $ (1,1) $ , and Rubik stands in a cell with coordinates $ (n,n) $ . Right after the start Furik runs towards Rubik, besides, if Furik stands at a cell with coordinates $ (i,j) $ , then he can move to cell $ (i+1,j) $ or $ (i,j+1) $ . After Furik reaches Rubik, Rubik starts running from cell with coordinates $ (n,n) $ to cell with coordinates $ (1,1) $ . If Rubik stands in cell $ (i,j) $ , then he can move to cell $ (i-1,j) $ or $ (i,j-1) $ . Neither Furik, nor Rubik are allowed to go beyond the boundaries of the field; if a player goes beyond the boundaries, he will be disqualified.\n\nTo win the race, Furik and Rubik must earn as many points as possible. The number of points is the sum of numbers from the cells Furik and Rubik visited. Each cell counts only once in the sum.\n\nPrint the maximum number of points Furik and Rubik can earn on the relay race.",
