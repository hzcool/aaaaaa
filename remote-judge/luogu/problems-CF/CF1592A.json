    "description": "One day, Ahmed\\_Hossam went to Hemose and said \"Let's solve a gym contest!\". Hemose didn't want to do that, as he was playing Valorant, so he came up with a problem and told it to Ahmed to distract him. Sadly, Ahmed can't solve it... Could you help him?\n\nThere is an Agent in Valorant, and he has $ n $ weapons. The $ i $ -th weapon has a damage value $ a_i $ , and the Agent will face an enemy whose health value is $ H $ .\n\nThe Agent will perform one or more moves until the enemy dies.\n\nIn one move, he will choose a weapon and decrease the enemy's health by its damage value. The enemy will die when his health will become less than or equal to $ 0 $ . However, not everything is so easy: the Agent can't choose the same weapon for $ 2 $ times in a row.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of times that the Agent will need to use the weapons to kill the enemy?",
    "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ $ (1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5) $ . Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ H $ $ (2 \\leq n \\leq 10^3, 1 \\leq H \\leq 10^9) $ \u2014 the number of available weapons and the initial health value of the enemy.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ $ (1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9) $ \u2014 the damage values of the weapons.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases doesn't exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
    "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of times that the Agent will have to use the weapons to kill the enemy.",
    "samples": [
        [
            "3\n2 4\n3 7\n2 6\n4 2\n3 11\n2 1 7",
            "1\n2\n3"
        ]
    ],
    "hint": "In the first test case, the Agent can use the second weapon, making health value of the enemy equal to $ 4-7=-3 $ . $ -3 \\le 0 $ , so the enemy is dead, and using weapon $ 1 $ time was enough.\n\nIn the second test case, the Agent can use the first weapon first, and then the second one. After this, the health of enemy will drop to $ 6-4-2 = 0 $ , meaning he would be killed after using weapons $ 2 $ times.\n\nIn the third test case, the Agent can use the weapons in order (third, first, third), decreasing the health value of enemy to $ 11 - 7 - 2 - 7 = -5 $ after using the weapons $ 3 $ times. Note that we can't kill the enemy by using the third weapon twice, as even though $ 11-7-7<0 $ , it's not allowed to use the same weapon twice in a row.",
