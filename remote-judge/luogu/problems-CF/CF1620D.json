    "description": "One day, early in the morning, you decided to buy yourself a bag of chips in the nearby store. The store has chips of $ n $ different flavors. A bag of the $ i $ -th flavor costs $ a_i $ burles.\n\nThe store may run out of some flavors, so you'll decide which one to buy after arriving there. But there are two major flaws in this plan:\n\n1. you have only coins of $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ burles;\n2. since it's morning, the store will ask you to pay in exact change, i. e. if you choose the $ i $ -th flavor, you'll have to pay exactly $ a_i $ burles.\n\nCoins are heavy, so you'd like to take the least possible number of coins in total. That's why you are wondering: what is the minimum total number of coins you should take with you, so you can buy a bag of chips of any flavor in exact change?",

So you can pay either exactly $ 8 = 2 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\cdot 2 $ or $ 10 = 2 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 2 $ .\n\nIn the third test case, it's enough to take $ 1 $ coin of value $ 3 $ and $ 2 $ coins of value $ 1 $ .",
