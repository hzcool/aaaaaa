    "description": "Graph constructive problems are back! This time the graph you are asked to build should match the following properties.\n\nThe graph is connected if and only if there exists a path between every pair of vertices.\n\nThe diameter (aka \"longest shortest path\") of a connected undirected graph is the maximum number of edges in the shortest path between any pair of its vertices.\n\nThe degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.\n\nGiven a sequence of $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ construct a connected undirected graph of $ n $ vertices such that:\n\n- the graph contains no self-loops and no multiple edges;\n- the degree $ d_i $ of the $ i $ -th vertex doesn't exceed $ a_i $ (i.e. $ d_i \\le a_i $ );\n- the diameter of the graph is maximum possible.\n\nOutput the resulting graph or report that no solution exists.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 3 \\le n \\le 500 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nThe second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le n - 1 $ ) \u2014 the upper limits to vertex degrees.",
    "outputFormat": "Print \"NO\" if no graph can be constructed under the given conditions.\n\nOtherwise print \"YES\" and the diameter of the resulting graph in the first line.\n\nThe second line should contain a single integer $ m $ \u2014 the number of edges in the resulting graph.\n\nThe $ i $ -th of the next $ m $ lines should contain two integers $ v_i, u_i $ ( $ 1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n $ , $ v_i \\neq u_i $ ) \u2014 the description of the $ i $ -th edge. The graph should contain no multiple edges \u2014 for each pair $ (x, y) $ you output, you should output no more pairs $ (x, y) $ or $ (y, x) $ .",
