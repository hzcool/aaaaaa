    "description": "Vasya owns three big integers \u2014 $ a, l, r $ . Let's define a partition of $ x $ such a sequence of strings $ s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k $ that $ s_1 + s_2 + \\dots + s_k = x $ , where $ + $ is a concatanation of strings. $ s_i $ is the $ i $ -th element of the partition. For example, number $ 12345 $ has the following partitions: \\[\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\"\\], \\[\"123\", \"4\", \"5\"\\], \\[\"1\", \"2345\"\\], \\[\"12345\"\\] and lots of others.\n\nLet's call some partition of $ a $ beautiful if each of its elements contains no leading zeros.\n\nVasya want to know the number of beautiful partitions of number $ a $ , which has each of $ s_i $ satisfy the condition $ l \\le s_i \\le r $ . Note that the comparison is the integer comparison, not the string one.\n\nHelp Vasya to count the amount of partitions of number $ a $ such that they match all the given requirements. The result can be rather big, so print it modulo $ 998244353 $ .",
