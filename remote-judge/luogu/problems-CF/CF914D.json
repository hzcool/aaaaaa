    "description": "Bash likes playing with arrays. He has an array $ a_{1},a_{2},...\\ a_{n} $ of $ n $ integers. He likes to guess the greatest common divisor (gcd) of different segments of the array. Of course, sometimes the guess is not correct. However, Bash will be satisfied if his guess is almost correct.\n\nSuppose he guesses that the gcd of the elements in the range $ [l,r] $ of $ a $ is $ x $ . He considers the guess to be almost correct if he can change at most one element in the segment such that the gcd of the segment is $ x $ after making the change. Note that when he guesses, he doesn't actually change the array \u2014 he just wonders if the gcd of the segment can be made $ x $ . Apart from this, he also sometimes makes changes to the array itself.\n\nSince he can't figure it out himself, Bash wants you to tell him which of his guesses are almost correct. Formally, you have to process $ q $ queries of one of the following forms:\n\n- $ 1lrx $ \u2014 Bash guesses that the gcd of the range $ [l,r] $ is $ x $ . Report if this guess is almost correct.\n- $ 2iy $ \u2014 Bash sets $ a_{i} $ to $ y $ .\n\nNote: The array is $ 1 $ -indexed.",
