    "description": "Since next season are coming, you'd like to form a team from two or three participants. There are $ n $ candidates, the $ i $ -th candidate has rank $ a_i $ . But you have weird requirements for your teammates: if you have rank $ v $ and have chosen the $ i $ -th and $ j $ -th candidate, then $ GCD(v, a_i) = X $ and $ LCM(v, a_j) = Y $ must be met.\n\nYou are very experienced, so you can change your rank to any non-negative integer but $ X $ and $ Y $ are tied with your birthdate, so they are fixed.\n\nNow you want to know, how many are there pairs $ (i, j) $ such that there exists an integer $ v $ meeting the following constraints: $ GCD(v, a_i) = X $ and $ LCM(v, a_j) = Y $ . It's possible that $ i = j $ and you form a team of two.\n\n $ GCD $ is the greatest common divisor of two number, $ LCM $ \u2014 the least common multiple.",
