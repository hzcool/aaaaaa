Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point $ 0 $ , and its end corresponding to the point $ l $ .

The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most $ d $ from it, where $ d $ is some positive number, common for all lanterns.\n\nVanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius $ d $ should the lanterns have to light the whole street?",
