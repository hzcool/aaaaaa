    "description": "You are given a rooted tree consisting of $ n $ vertices numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The root is vertex $ 1 $ . There is also a string $ s $ denoting the color of each vertex: if $ s_i = \\texttt{B} $ , then vertex $ i $ is black, and if $ s_i = \\texttt{W} $ , then vertex $ i $ is white.\n\nA subtree of the tree is called balanced if the number of white vertices equals the number of black vertices. Count the number of balanced subtrees.\n\nA tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree with a selected vertex, which is called the root. In this problem, all trees have root $ 1 $ .\n\nThe tree is specified by an array of parents $ a_2, \\dots, a_n $ containing $ n-1 $ numbers: $ a_i $ is the parent of the vertex with the number $ i $ for all $ i = 2, \\dots, n $ . The parent of a vertex $ u $ is a vertex that is the next vertex on a simple path from $ u $ to the root.\n\nThe subtree of a vertex $ u $ is the set of all vertices that pass through $ u $ on a simple path to the root. For example, in the picture below, $ 7 $ is in the subtree of $ 3 $ because the simple path $ 7 \\to 5 \\to 3 \\to 1 $ passes through $ 3 $ . Note that a vertex is included in its subtree, and the subtree of the root is the entire tree.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1676G/70fb6ac8a70942903450f21b07ea9969f086df2c.png) The picture shows the tree for $ n=7 $ , $ a=[1,1,2,3,3,5] $ , and $ s=\\texttt{WBBWWBW} $ . The subtree at the vertex $ 3 $ is balanced.",
