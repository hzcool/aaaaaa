It is guaranteed that there is at least one book on the bookshelf.\n\nIn one move, you can choose some contiguous segment $ [l; r] $ consisting of books (i.e. for each $ i $ from $ l $ to $ r $ the condition $ a_i = 1 $ holds) and:\n\n- Shift it to the right by $ 1 $ : move the book at index $ i $ to $ i + 1 $ for all $ l \\le i \\le r $ . This move can be done only if $ r+1 \\le n $ and there is no book at the position $ r+1 $ .\n- Shift it to the left by $ 1 $ : move the book at index $ i $ to $ i-1 $ for all $ l \\le i \\le r $ . This move can be done only if $ l-1 \\ge 1 $ and there is no book at the position $ l-1 $ .\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of moves required to collect all the books on the shelf as a contiguous (consecutive) segment (i.e. the segment without any gaps).\n\nFor example, for $ a = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] $ there is a gap between books ( $ a_4 = 0 $ when $ a_3 = 1 $ and $ a_5 = 1 $ ), for $ a = [1, 1, 0] $ there are no gaps between books and for $ a = [0, 0,0] $ there are also no gaps between books.\n\nYou have to answer $ t $ independent test cases.",

The second line of the test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \\le a_i \\le 1 $ ), where $ a_i $ is $ 1 $ if there is a book at this position and $ 0 $ otherwise.

After all moves, the books form the contiguous segment $ [1; 3] $ .

After all moves, the books form the contiguous segment $ [3; 4] $ . So the answer is $ 4 $ .\n\nIn the fifth test case of the example, you can shift the segment $ [1; 2] $ to the right.
