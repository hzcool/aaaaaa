    "description": "Alice and Bob don't play games anymore. Now they study properties of all sorts of graphs together. Alice invented the following task: she takes a complete undirected graph with $ n $ vertices, chooses some $ m $ edges and keeps them. Bob gets the ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF229C/4408e88d41b3075c330afb5b8cbb30c34ea57359.png) remaining edges.\n\nAlice and Bob are fond of \"triangles\" in graphs, that is, cycles of length 3. That's why they wonder: what total number of triangles is there in the two graphs formed by Alice and Bob's edges, correspondingly?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{6},0<=m<=10^{6} $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the initial complete graph and the number of edges in Alice's graph, correspondingly. Then $ m $ lines follow: the $ i $ -th line contains two space-separated integers $ a_{i} $ , $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n $ , $ a_{i}\u2260b_{i} $ ), \u2014 the numbers of the two vertices connected by the $ i $ -th edge in Alice's graph. It is guaranteed that Alice's graph contains no multiple edges and self-loops. It is guaranteed that the initial complete graph also contains no multiple edges and self-loops.\n\nConsider the graph vertices to be indexed in some way from 1 to $ n $ .",
