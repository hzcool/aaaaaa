    "description": "An e-commerce startup pitches to the investors to get funding. They have been functional for $ n $ weeks now and also have a website!\n\nFor each week they know the number of unique visitors during this week $ v_{i} $ and the revenue $ c_{i} $ . To evaluate the potential of the startup at some range of weeks from $ l $ to $ r $ inclusive investors use the minimum among the maximum number of visitors multiplied by $ 100 $ and the minimum revenue during this period, that is:\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF633E/d4c95097082aa3764e2e11310a38092f1681fe02.png)The truth is that investors have no idea how to efficiently evaluate the startup, so they are going to pick some $ k $ random distinct weeks $ l_{i} $ and give them to managers of the startup. For each $ l_{i} $ they should pick some $ r_{i}>=l_{i} $ and report maximum number of visitors and minimum revenue during this period.\n\nThen, investors will calculate the potential of the startup for each of these ranges and take minimum value of $ p(l_{i},r_{i}) $ as the total evaluation grade of the startup. Assuming that managers of the startup always report the optimal values of $ r_{i} $ for some particular $ l_{i} $ , i.e., the value such that the resulting grade of the startup is maximized, what is the expected resulting grade of the startup?",

    "hint": "Consider the first sample.\n\nIf the investors ask for $ l_{i}=1 $ onwards, startup will choose $ r_{i}=1 $ , such that max number of visitors is $ 3 $ and minimum revenue is $ 300 $ . Thus, potential in this case is $ min(3\u00b7100,300)=300 $ .\n\nIf the investors ask for $ l_{i}=2 $ onwards, startup will choose $ r_{i}=3 $ , such that max number of visitors is $ 2 $ and minimum revenue is $ 200 $ . Thus, potential in this case is $ min(2\u00b7100,200)=200 $ .\n\nIf the investors ask for $ l_{i}=3 $ onwards, startup will choose $ r_{i}=3 $ , such that max number of visitors is $ 1 $ and minimum revenue is $ 300 $ . Thus, potential in this case is $ min(1\u00b7100,300)=100 $ .\n\nWe have to choose a set of size $ 2 $ equi-probably and take minimum of each. The possible sets here are : $ {200,300} $ , $ {100,300} $ , $ {100,200} $ , effectively the set of possible values as perceived by investors equi-probably: $ {200,100,100} $ .
