    "description": "Vasya has $ n $ pairs of socks. In the morning of each day Vasya has to put on a pair of socks before he goes to school. When he comes home in the evening, Vasya takes off the used socks and throws them away. Every $ m $ -th day (at days with numbers $ m,2m,3m,... $ ) mom buys a pair of socks to Vasya. She does it late in the evening, so that Vasya cannot put on a new pair of socks before the next day. How many consecutive days pass until Vasya runs out of socks?",
