    "description": "In fact, the problems E1 and E2 do not have much in common. You should probably think of them as two separate problems.\n\nA permutation $ p $ of size $ n $ is given. A permutation of size $ n $ is an array of size $ n $ in which each integer from $ 1 $ to $ n $ occurs exactly once. For example, $ [1, 4, 3, 2] $ and $ [4, 2, 1, 3] $ are correct permutations while $ [1, 2, 4] $ and $ [1, 2, 2] $ are not.\n\nLet us consider an empty [deque](https://tinyurl.com/pfeucbux) (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements $ [1, 5, 2] $ currently in the deque, adding an element $ 4 $ to the beginning will produce the sequence $ [\\color{red}{4}, 1, 5, 2] $ , and adding same element to the end will produce $ [1, 5, 2, \\color{red}{4}] $ .\n\nThe elements of the permutation are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with $ p_1 $ and finishing with $ p_n $ . Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or the end.\n\nFor example, if we consider a permutation $ p = [3, 1, 2, 4] $ , one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this:\n\n $ \\quad $ 1.add $ 3 $ to the end of the deque:deque has a sequence $ [\\color{red}{3}] $ in it; $ \\quad $ 2.add $ 1 $ to the beginning of the deque:deque has a sequence $ [\\color{red}{1}, 3] $ in it; $ \\quad $ 3.add $ 2 $ to the end of the deque:deque has a sequence $ [1, 3, \\color{red}{2}] $ in it; $ \\quad $ 4.add $ 4 $ to the end of the deque:deque has a sequence $ [1, 3, 2, \\color{red}{4}] $ in it;Find the lexicographically smallest possible sequence of elements in the deque after the entire permutation has been processed.\n\nA sequence $ [x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n] $ is lexicographically smaller than the sequence $ [y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n] $ if there exists such $ i \\leq n $ that $ x_1 = y_1 $ , $ x_2 = y_2 $ , $ \\ldots $ , $ x_{i - 1} = y_{i - 1} $ and $ x_i < y_i $ . In other words, if the sequences $ x $ and $ y $ have some (possibly empty) matching prefix, and the next element of the sequence $ x $ is strictly smaller than the corresponding element of the sequence $ y $ . For example, the sequence $ [1, 3, 2, 4] $ is smaller than the sequence $ [1, 3, 4, 2] $ because after the two matching elements $ [1, 3] $ in the start the first sequence has an element $ 2 $ which is smaller than the corresponding element $ 4 $ in the second sequence.",

The second line of the description contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ p_i $ ( $ 1 \\le p_i \\le n $ ; all $ p_i $ are all unique) \u2014 elements of the permutation.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ .",
