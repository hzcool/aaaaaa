    "description": "What joy! Petya's parents went on a business trip for the whole year and the playful kid is left all by himself. Petya got absolutely happy. He jumped on the bed and threw pillows all day long, until...\n\nToday Petya opened the cupboard and found a scary note there. His parents had left him with duties: he should water their favourite flower all year, each day, in the morning, in the afternoon and in the evening. \"Wait a second!\" \u2014 thought Petya. He know for a fact that if he fulfills the parents' task in the $ i $ -th ( $ 1<=i<=12 $ ) month of the year, then the flower will grow by $ a_{i} $ centimeters, and if he doesn't water the flower in the $ i $ -th month, then the flower won't grow this month. Petya also knows that try as he might, his parents won't believe that he has been watering the flower if it grows strictly less than by $ k $ centimeters.\n\nHelp Petya choose the minimum number of months when he will water the flower, given that the flower should grow no less than by $ k $ centimeters.",

    "outputFormat": "Print the only integer \u2014 the minimum number of months when Petya has to water the flower so that the flower grows no less than by $ k $ centimeters. If the flower can't grow by $ k $ centimeters in a year, print -1.",

Then the flower grows by exactly five centimeters.\n\nIn the second sample Petya's parents will believe him even if the flower doesn't grow at all ( $ k=0 $ ). So, it is possible for Petya not to water the flower at all.",
