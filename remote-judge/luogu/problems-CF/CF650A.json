    "description": "Watchmen are in a danger and Doctor Manhattan together with his friend Daniel Dreiberg should warn them as soon as possible. There are $ n $ watchmen on a plane, the $ i $ -th watchman is located at point $ (x_{i},y_{i}) $ .\n\nThey need to arrange a plan, but there are some difficulties on their way. As you know, Doctor Manhattan considers the distance between watchmen $ i $ and $ j $ to be $ |x_{i}-x_{j}|+|y_{i}-y_{j}| $ . Daniel, as an ordinary person, calculates the distance using the formula ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF650A/fcefde1ea60e1105aa698e148af7dc900a7454c9.png).\n\nThe success of the operation relies on the number of pairs $ (i,j) $ ( $ 1<=i&lt;j<=n $ ), such that the distance between watchman $ i $ and watchmen $ j $ calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance between them calculated by Daniel. You were asked to compute the number of such pairs.",
