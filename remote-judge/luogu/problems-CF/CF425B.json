    "description": "Sereja has an $ n\u00d7m $ rectangular table $ a $ , each cell of the table contains a zero or a number one. Sereja wants his table to meet the following requirement: each connected component of the same values forms a rectangle with sides parallel to the sides of the table. Rectangles should be filled with cells, that is, if a component form a rectangle of size $ h\u00d7w $ , then the component must contain exactly $ hw $ cells.\n\nA connected component of the same values is a set of cells of the table that meet the following conditions:\n\n- every two cells of the set have the same value;\n- the cells of the set form a connected region on the table (two cells are connected if they are adjacent in some row or some column of the table);\n- it is impossible to add any cell to the set unless we violate the two previous conditions.\n\nCan Sereja change the values of at most $ k $ cells of the table so that the table met the described requirement? What minimum number of table cells should he change in this case?",
