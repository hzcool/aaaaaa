    "description": "Recently, Pari and Arya did some research about NP-Hard problems and they found the minimum vertex cover problem very interesting.\n\nSuppose the graph $ G $ is given. Subset $ A $ of its vertices is called a vertex cover of this graph, if for each edge $ uv $ there is at least one endpoint of it in this set, i.e. ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF687A/346f03956cdac7458eec43b55228ce8629640261.png) or ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF687A/65e661dc0c93081d16f2e3a6dd63015d37b62d35.png) (or both).\n\nPari and Arya have won a great undirected graph as an award in a team contest. Now they have to split it in two parts, but both of them want their parts of the graph to be a vertex cover.\n\nThey have agreed to give you their graph and you need to find two disjoint subsets of its vertices $ A $ and $ B $ , such that both $ A $ and $ B $ are vertex cover or claim it's impossible. Each vertex should be given to no more than one of the friends (or you can even keep it for yourself).",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2<=n<=100000 $ , $ 1<=m<=100000 $ ) \u2014 the number of vertices and the number of edges in the prize graph, respectively.\n\nEach of the next $ m $ lines contains a pair of integers $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ ( $ 1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n $ ), denoting an undirected edge between $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ . It's guaranteed the graph won't contain any self-loops or multiple edges.",
    "outputFormat": "If it's impossible to split the graph between Pari and Arya as they expect, print \"-1\" (without quotes).\n\nIf there are two disjoint sets of vertices, such that both sets are vertex cover, print their descriptions. Each description must contain two lines. The first line contains a single integer $ k $ denoting the number of vertices in that vertex cover, and the second line contains $ k $ integers \u2014 the indices of vertices. Note that because of $ m>=1 $ , vertex cover cannot be empty.",

    "hint": "In the first sample, you can give the vertex number $ 2 $ to Arya and vertices numbered $ 1 $ and $ 3 $ to Pari and keep vertex number $ 4 $ for yourself (or give it someone, if you wish).\n\nIn the second sample, there is no way to satisfy both Pari and Arya.",
