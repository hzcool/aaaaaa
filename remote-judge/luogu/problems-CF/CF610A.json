    "description": "Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length $ n $ . He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be $ n $ .\n\nPasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.\n\nYour task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer $ x $ , such that the number of parts of length $ x $ in the first way differ from the number of parts of length $ x $ in the second way.",
