    "description": "You are playing a game similar to Sokoban on an infinite number line. The game is discrete, so you only consider integer positions on the line.\n\nYou start on a position $ 0 $ . There are $ n $ boxes, the $ i $ -th box is on a position $ a_i $ . All positions of the boxes are distinct. There are also $ m $ special positions, the $ j $ -th position is $ b_j $ . All the special positions are also distinct.\n\nIn one move you can go one position to the left or to the right. If there is a box in the direction of your move, then you push the box to the next position in that direction. If the next position is taken by another box, then that box is also pushed to the next position, and so on. You can't go through the boxes. You can't pull the boxes towards you.\n\nYou are allowed to perform any number of moves (possibly, zero). Your goal is to place as many boxes on special positions as possible. Note that some boxes can be initially placed on special positions.",

    "hint": "In the first testcase you can go $ 5 $ to the right: the box on position $ 1 $ gets pushed to position $ 6 $ and the box on position $ 5 $ gets pushed to position $ 7 $ . Then you can go $ 6 $ to the left to end up on position $ -1 $ and push a box to $ -2 $ . At the end, the boxes are on positions $ [-2, 6, 7, 11, 15] $ , respectively. Among them positions $ [-2, 6, 7, 15] $ are special, thus, the answer is $ 4 $ .\n\nIn the second testcase you can push the box from $ -1 $ to $ -10^9 $ , then the box from $ 1 $ to $ 10^9 $ and obtain the answer $ 2 $ .\n\nThe third testcase showcases that you are not allowed to pull the boxes, thus, you can't bring them closer to special positions.\n\nIn the fourth testcase all the boxes are already on special positions, so you can do nothing and still obtain the answer $ 3 $ .\n\nIn the fifth testcase there are fewer special positions than boxes. You can move either $ 8 $ or $ 9 $ to the right to have some box on position $ 10 $ .",
