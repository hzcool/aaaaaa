    "description": "Even polar bears feel cold when lying on the ice. Therefore, a polar bear Alice is going to make a carpet. The carpet can be viewed as a grid with height $ h $ and width $ w $ . Then the grid is divided into $ h\u00d7w $ squares. Alice is going to assign one of $ k $ different colors to each square. The colors are numbered from 1 to $ k $ . She may choose not to use all of the colors.\n\nHowever, there are some restrictions. For every two adjacent squares (squares that shares an edge) $ x $ and $ y $ , there is a color constraint in one of the forms:\n\n- $ color(x)=color(y) $ , or\n- $ color(x)\u2260color(y) $ .\n\nExample of the color constraints:\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF297D/535d1d4ec9a1bcb4f1f5ac12060cde0f65471360.png)Ideally, Alice wants to satisfy all color constraints. But again, life in the Arctic is hard. It is not always possible to satisfy all color constraints. Fortunately, she will still be happy if at least ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF297D/c7b5e8f543c3882ba6f2a662e01781b4de30f8c7.png) of the color constraints are satisfied.\n\nIf she has $ 4 $ colors she can color the carpet in the following way:\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF297D/84535e9e280c4fb80d9cbe6a8b779a69a879098d.png)And she is happy because ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF297D/050547ba0080dee4ce4e2010a283122ee46b002c.png) of the color constraints are satisfied, and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF297D/93a2fe0ea2a5cac28f71987aac7a9527d1566697.png).
