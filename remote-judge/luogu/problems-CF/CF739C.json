    "description": "Alyona has built $ n $ towers by putting small cubes some on the top of others. Each cube has size $ 1\u00d71\u00d71 $ . A tower is a non-zero amount of cubes standing on the top of each other. The towers are next to each other, forming a row.\n\nSometimes Alyona chooses some segment towers, and put on the top of each tower several cubes. Formally, Alyouna chooses some segment of towers from $ l_{i} $ to $ r_{i} $ and adds $ d_{i} $ cubes on the top of them.\n\nLet the sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ be the heights of the towers from left to right. Let's call as a segment of towers $ a_{l},a_{l+1},...,a_{r} $ a hill if the following condition holds: there is integer $ k $ ( $ l<=k<=r $ ) such that $ a_{l}&lt;a_{l+1}&lt;a_{l+2}&lt;...&lt;a_{k}&gt;a_{k+1}&gt;a_{k+2}&gt;...&gt;a_{r} $ .\n\nAfter each addition of $ d_{i} $ cubes on the top of the towers from $ l_{i} $ to $ r_{i} $ , Alyona wants to know the maximum width among all hills. The width of a hill is the number of towers in it.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contain single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=3\u00b710^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of towers.\n\nThe second line contain $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) \u2014 the number of cubes in each tower.\n\nThe third line contain single integer $ m $ ( $ 1<=m<=3\u00b710^{5} $ ) \u2014 the number of additions.\n\nThe next $ m $ lines contain $ 3 $ integers each. The $ i $ -th of these lines contains integers $ l_{i} $ , $ r_{i} $ and $ d_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ , $ 1<=d_{i}<=10^{9} $ ), that mean that Alyona puts $ d_{i} $ cubes on the tio of each of the towers from $ l_{i} $ to $ r_{i} $ .",

The hill with maximum width is $ [7,5] $ , thus the maximum width is $ 2 $ .\n\nAfter addition of $ 1 $ cube on the second tower, the number of cubes in the towers become equal to $ [7,8,7,5,5] $ . The hill with maximum width is now $ [7,8,7,5] $ , thus the maximum width is $ 4 $ .\n\nAfter addition of $ 1 $ cube on the fourth tower, the number of cubes in the towers become equal to $ [7,8,7,6,5] $ .
