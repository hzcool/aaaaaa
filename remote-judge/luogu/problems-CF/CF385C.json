    "description": "Recently, the bear started studying data structures and faced the following problem.\n\nYou are given a sequence of integers $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n} $ of length $ n $ and $ m $ queries, each of them is characterized by two integers $ l_{i},r_{i} $ . Let's introduce $ f(p) $ to represent the number of such indexes $ k $ , that $ x_{k} $ is divisible by $ p $ . The answer to the query $ l_{i},r_{i} $ is the sum: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF385C/835eb9f4aebf62a9178a923ec511d1ceb493d06f.png), where $ S(l_{i},r_{i}) $ is a set of prime numbers from segment $ [l_{i},r_{i}] $ (both borders are included in the segment).\n\nHelp the bear cope with the problem.",

The numbers are not necessarily distinct.\n\nThe third line contains integer $ m $ $ (1<=m<=50000) $ . Each of the following $ m $ lines contains a pair of space-separated integers, $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ $ (2<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=2\u00b710^{9}) $ \u2014 the numbers that characterize the current query.",

The second query comes $ l=3 $ , $ r=12 $ . You need to count $ f(3)+f(5)+f(7)+f(11)=1+4+2+0=7 $ .\n3. The third query comes $ l=4 $ , $ r=4 $ . As this interval has no prime numbers, then the sum equals 0.",
