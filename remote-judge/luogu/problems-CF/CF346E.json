    "description": " In Doodle Jump the aim is to guide a four-legged creature called \"The Doodler\" up a never-ending series of platforms without falling. \u2014 Wikipedia.\n\nIt is a very popular game and xiaodao likes it very much. One day when playing the game she wondered whether there exists a platform that the doodler couldn't reach due to the limits of its jumping ability. Consider the following problem.\n\nThere are $ n $ platforms. The height of the $ x $ -th ( $ 1<=x<=n $ ) platform is $ a\u00b7x $ mod $ p $ , where $ a $ and $ p $ are positive co-prime integers. The maximum possible height of a Doodler's jump is $ h $ . That is, it can jump from height $ h_{1} $ to height $ h_{2} $ ( $ h_{1}&lt;h_{2} $ ) if $ h_{2}-h_{1}<=h $ . Initially, the Doodler is on the ground, the height of which is 0. The question is whether it can reach the highest platform or not.\n\nFor example, when $ a=7 $ , $ n=4 $ , $ p=12 $ , $ h=2 $ , the heights of the platforms are $ 7 $ , $ 2 $ , $ 9 $ , $ 4 $ as in the picture below. With the first jump the Doodler can jump to the platform at height $ 2 $ , with the second one the Doodler can jump to the platform at height $ 4 $ , but then it can't jump to any of the higher platforms. So, it can't reach the highest platform.\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF346E/eac4a985e004e32325c04bd865762a38ac4e9205.png)User xiaodao thought about the problem for a long time but didn't solve it, so she asks you for help. Also, she has a lot of instances of the problem. Your task is solve all of these instances.",
