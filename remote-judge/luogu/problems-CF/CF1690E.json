    "description": "A batch of $ n $ goods ( $ n $ \u2014 an even number) is brought to the store, $ i $ -th of which has weight $ a_i $ . Before selling the goods, they must be packed into packages. After packing, the following will be done:\n\n- There will be $ \\frac{n}{2} $ packages, each package contains exactly two goods;\n- The weight of the package that contains goods with indices $ i $ and $ j $ ( $ 1 \\le i, j \\le n $ ) is $ a_i + a_j $ .\n\nWith this, the cost of a package of weight $ x $ is always $ \\left \\lfloor\\frac{x}{k}\\right\\rfloor $ burles (rounded down), where $ k $ \u2014 a fixed and given value.\n\nPack the goods to the packages so that the revenue from their sale is maximized. In other words, make such $ \\frac{n}{2} $ pairs of given goods that the sum of the values $ \\left \\lfloor\\frac{x_i}{k} \\right \\rfloor $ , where $ x_i $ is the weight of the package number $ i $ ( $ 1 \\le i \\le \\frac{n}{2} $ ), is maximal.\n\nFor example, let $ n = 6, k = 3 $ , weights of goods $ a = [3, 2, 7, 1, 4, 8] $ . Let's pack them into the following packages.\n\n- In the first package we will put the third and sixth goods. Its weight will be $ a_3 + a_6 = 7 + 8 = 15 $ . The cost of the package will be $ \\left \\lfloor\\frac{15}{3}\\right\\rfloor = 5 $ burles.\n- In the second package put the first and fifth goods, the weight is $ a_1 + a_5 = 3 + 4 = 7 $ . The cost of the package is $ \\left \\lfloor\\frac{7}{3}\\right\\rfloor = 2 $ burles.\n- In the third package put the second and fourth goods, the weight is $ a_2 + a_4 = 2 + 1 = 3 $ . The cost of the package is $ \\left \\lfloor\\frac{3}{3}\\right\\rfloor = 1 $ burle.\n\nWith this packing, the total cost of all packs would be $ 5 + 2 + 1 = 8 $ burles.",

The number $ n $ \u2014 is even.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains exactly $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $ ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all the test cases does not exceed $ 2\\cdot10^5 $ .",
