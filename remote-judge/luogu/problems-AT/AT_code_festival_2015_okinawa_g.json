    "hint": "### Problem\n\nCat Snuke has a pair of vases. One is noted as vase $ 1 $, the other one is noted as vase $ 2 $. At first, the vase $ 1 $ contains $ A $ blue flowers and $ B $ red flowers. In addition, the number of blue flowers is larger than or equal to the number of red flower, in other words, $ A\\ \u2267\\ B $. In addition, vase $ 2 $ is empty, contains neither blue flowers nor red flowers.\n\n By the way, Cat Snuke doesn\u2019t like mixing a specific number of red flowers with a specific number of blue flowers. Such combination is called as a **Dirty Placement** . There are $ N $ different Dirty Placements in total, the $ i_{th} $ **Dirty Placement** is the combination of precisely $ p_i $ blue flowers and $ q_i $ red flowers.\n\nCat Snuke wants to move all the flowers that are in vase $ 1 $ to vase $ 2 $ one by one. However, Cat Snuke has to follow the following rules.\n\n- For vase $ 1 $ and vase $ 2 $, the number of the blue flowers should always be larger than or equal to that of the red flowers.\n- For vase $ 1 $ and vase $ 2 $, the combination of the number of the blue flowers and the number of the red flowers must not be any **Dirty Placement** (at anytime).\n\nIn accordance with the above rules, answer the number of all the possible methods that can move all the flower in vase $ 1 $ to vase $ 2 $, modulo $ 1,000,000,007 $. Please note that all the flowers with the same color are indistinguishable (identical).\n\n### Sample Explanation 1\n\nAs shown below, there are two possible ways to move flowers. - The moving order is as, blue, blue, red, blue. - The moving order is as, blue, red, blue, blue."
