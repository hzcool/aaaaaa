    "hint": "### Problem\n\nYou are given $ N $ points of integer lattice on a rectangular coordinate plane, You want to choose some points from them to make a regular polygon by connecting the chosen points with straight lines. Also, you want to choose as many points as possible to make a regular polygon.\n\nDetermine the points you should choose to make a regular polygon which has most vertices possible. If there are more than one possible answers, you may choose any one of them.\n\n### Sample Explanation 1\n\nAmong the given $ 6 $ points, you can choose $ 4 $ points $ (1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1) $ to make a regular square, which has the most vertex possible. So the answer is $ 4 $ and the indices of those points. The $ 4 $ points $ (-1,0),(1,0),(1,2),(-1,2) $ can also make a regular square. So, the indices of them, $ {1,2,5,6} $, will be considered correct too.\n\n### Sample Explanation 2\n\nThe given points are on a straight line. You cannot make any regular polygon from them."
