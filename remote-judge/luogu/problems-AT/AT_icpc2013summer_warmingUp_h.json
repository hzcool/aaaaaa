More precisely, there exists a sequence of integers $ a_1 $, $ a_2 $, ..., $ a_N $ such that\n\n- the 1st card in the resulting order is always the $ a_1 $-th card in the initial order,\n- the 2nd card in the resulting order is always the $ a_2 $-th card in the initial order,\n- ..., and so on.\n \n  \n He wanted to know this sequence, so he setup $ N $ cards in the ascending order: $ 1 $, $ 2 $, ..., $ N $. However, he accidentally pushed the switch $ K $ times, and the resulting order of the cards was $ b_1 $, $ b_2 $, ..., $ b_N $.  \n But KM says that you can guess $ a_1 $, $ a_2 $, ..., $ a_N $ from $ b_1 $, $ b_2 $, ..., $ b_N $. Can you do that?  \n The first line of the input file contains the integers $ N $ ($ 1\\ \\leq\\ N\\ \\leq\\ 10^5 $) and $ K $ ($ 1\\ \\leq\\ K\\ \\leq\\ 10^{18} $), separated by a space.  \n The second line of the input file contains N different integers which denotes $ b_1 $, $ b_2 $, ..., $ b_N $ ($ 1\\ \\leq\\ b_i\\ \\leq\\ N $) in this order, separated by a space.  \n If KM's hypothesis seems to be wrong, just print `Impossible`. If there are several possibilities, print `Ambiguous`. Otherwise, print $ N $ integers which denotes $ a_1 $, $ a_2 $, ..., $ a_N $ in this order, separated by a space. ```\n\n3 2\n3 1 2\n```\n\n ```\n\n2 3 1\n```\n\n ```\n\n3 2\n1 3 2\n```\n\n ```\n\nImpossible\n```\n\n ```\n\n4 2\n2 1 4 3\n```\n\n ```\n\nAmbiguous\n```",
