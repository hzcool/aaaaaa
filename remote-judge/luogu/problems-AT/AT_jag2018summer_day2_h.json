Count the number of strings $ T $ that satisfies all of the following conditions:\n\n- $ T $ is a string of the same length as $ S $, consisting of lowercase English letters.\n- For all $ K $ ( $ 1\\ \\leq\\ K\\ \\leq\\ |S| $ ), the string formed by the first $ K $ letters of $ S $ does not coincide with the string formed by the last $ K $ letters of $ T $.\n\nSince the answer can be very large, find the number modulo $ 10^9+7 $.",
