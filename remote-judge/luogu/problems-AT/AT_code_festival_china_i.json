    "hint": "### Problem\n\nThere is a two-dimensional grid of $ N\\ \\times\\ N $ cells. Let $ (r,\\ c) $ be the $ r $-th row's $ c $-th cell from the left. Some of these cells are painted black, other cells are painted white.\n\nAt first you are at $ (1,\\ 1) $, and you want to go to $ (N,\\ N) $. However, there's a stranger Mr.X trying to obstruct your way to $ (N,\\ N) $.\n\nYou and Mr.X move in turns. At the beginning Mr.X starts the move. On each move each person can move as following.\n\n- Mr.X moves to one of the **white cell** adjoining to the cell where you are. If there is no cell Mr.X can move to, Mr.X disappears from the grid for that turn.\n- You can move to one of the cells adjoining to the cell where you are, which **Mr.X didn't move to in his last turn.**\n\nIn other words, you can move to one of the adjoining cell. But before your move Mr.X choose one of the possible move and block that. However, Mr.X can't block your move to a black cell.\n\nYou will be given the color of each cell. Determine if you can reach $ (N,\\ N) $ no matter how Mr.X obstructs your way.\n\n### Sample Explanation 1\n\nIf Mr.X blocks $ (1,\\ 2) $ at his first move, you can move to $ (2,\\ 1) $. After that you can follow the black cells to reach $ (4,\\ 4) $. If Mr.X blocks $ (2,\\ 1) $ you can move to $ (1,\\ 2) $ and then follow the black cells to reach $ (4,\\ 4) $. Therefore, you can reach $ (4,\\ 4) $ notwithstanding Mr.X's obstruction. The answer is `YES`.\n\n### Sample Explanation 2\n\nIn this case, when you are at $ (1,\\ c) $, Mr.X can block $ (2,\\ c) $. If Mr.X follows this optimal strategy for him, you can't reach $ (4,\\ 4) $. The answer is `NO`.\n\n### Sample Explanation 3\n\nIn this case, Mr.X can block $ (2,2) $."
