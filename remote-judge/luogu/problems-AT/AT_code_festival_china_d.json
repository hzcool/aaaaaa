    "hint": "### Problem\n\nThere is a maze which has $ 1 $ start and $ 2 $ goals. The maze is made of $ H $ rows and $ W $ columns rectangular array of cells. Each cell is specified as start, goal, pathway, or an obstacle. Let $ (r,\\ c) $ be the $ r $-th row's, $ c $-th cell from the left.\n\nYou will be given a map of the maze. You have to draw two paths from start cell to each goal cell in that map. A path is an array of cells that begins with start cell and ends with goal cell, contains no obstacle cell, and each pair of neighboring cells in the array is adjoining. A pair of cells $ (a,\\ b) $ and $ (c,\\ d) $ is adjoining if $ |a-c|+|b-d|=1 $. The paths you draw must fulfill the following conditions.\n\n- Each path must contain the least possible number of cells. **That means each path must be the shortest path from start to each goal.**\n- To make paths distinguishable, each path must not have any cell in common, except the start cell.\n\nDetermine if you can make the paths that meets the condition in the given maze, and show the paths in the maze if possible. Read the Input and Output section for the detailed format.\n\n### Sample Explanation 2\n\nThe goal cell is not an obstacle, so the shortest path to the goal `A` is only $ (1,\\ 1) $ \u2192 $ (1,\\ 2) $ \u2192 $ (1,\\ 3) $. However, that path contains the goal cell B and thus you cannot avoid to use the common cell in the shortest paths. Therefore, you should output `NA`."
