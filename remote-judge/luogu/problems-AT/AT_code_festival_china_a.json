    "hint": "### Problem\n\nAlice has a box locked with $ n $ digits dial lock. Each dial of the lock can be set to a digit from $ 0 $ to $ 9 $. Unfortunately, she forgot the passcode (of $ n $ digits). Now she will try all possible combinations of digits to unlock the key.\n\nShe can do one of the following procedure each time.\n\n- Choose $ 1 $ dial and add $ 1 $ to that digit. (If the digit chosen was $ 9 $, it will be $ 0 $).\n- Choose $ 1 $ dial and subtract $ 1 $ from that digit. (If the digit chosen was $ 0 $, it will be $ 9 $).\n\nCuriously, she wants to try all combinations even if she found the correct passcode during the trials. But it is a hard work to try all the $ 10^n $ combinations. Help her by showing the way how to make the procedure less as possible.\n\nInitially, the combination of digits of the lock is set to $ 00..0 $.\n\nCalculate $ m $, the minimum number of procedures to try all combinations of digits, and show the $ m+1 $ combinations of digits after each procedures, including the initial combination $ 00..0 $. If there are more than one possible answer, you may choose any one of them.\n\nChecking if the current combination of digits matches the passcode doesn't count as a procedure.\n\n### Sample Explanation 1\n\nDon't forget to output the minimum number of procedures $ 9 $ on the first line. On the following lines, note that you have to output $ m+1 $ lines including the initial combination $ 0 $.",
