    "hint": "### Problem\n\n Wolf Sothe owns a long land in the jungle. In this linear land, $ N $ trees grow at regular intervals. The size of the $ i_{th} $ tree from one end is given as $ t_i $.\n\nInside the jungle it is dark because trees obstruct sunlight. In order to let sunlight shine into the jungle, Wolf Sothe considers cutting some of the $ N $ trees (or cutting no one). More specifically, trees will be cut with the following rules.\n\n- Up to $ M $ trees can be cut (no more than $ M $).\n- Considering the impact on the surrounding ecosystem, it is not allowed to cut two or more trees in arbitrary $ K $ consecutive trees. More precisely, there is not $ i(1\u2266i\u2266N-K+1) $ such that $ 2 $ or more trees are cut in the $ i_{th} $, $ (i\\ +\\ 1)_{th} $, ......, $ (i\\ +\\ K-1)_{th} $ trees from one end.\n- If Wolf Sothe cuts the $ i_{th} $ tree from one end, the size of the tree $ t_i $ becomes $ 0 $.\n- We want the maximum value of the sum of sizes of $ K $ consecutive trees to be as small as possible. Namely, we want to minimize ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/AT_code_festival_2015_okinawa_j/d25f33d1f6ce52c73490ab5c9be9aed1a1e4ac83.png) .\n\nSince the size of the $ N $ trees and $ M $, $ K $ have been given, when we make the optimal cutting choice for the trees, please obtain the minimum value of the maximum value of the sum of sizes of consecutive $ K $ trees.\n\n### Sample Explanation 1\n\nIf Wolf Sothe cuts the $ 3_{rd} $ and $ 6_{th} $ tree, the minimum value of the maximum value of the sum of sizes of consecutive $ 3 $ consecutive trees will be obtained when it is for the $ 2_{nd} $, $ 3_{rd} $, $ 4_{th} $ tree. The sum of sizes is $ 5+0+2=7 $."
