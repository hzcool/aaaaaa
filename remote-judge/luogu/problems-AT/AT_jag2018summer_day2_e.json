Whether she loves $ X $ or not is determined as follows:\n\n- If $ X $ is the empty set, she loves $ X $.\n- If, for any (possibly the same) two elements $ u $ and $ v $ in $ X $, at least one of $ u+v $ and $ {\\rm\\ abs}(u-v) $ is contained in $ X $, she loves $ X $.\n- If none of the above conditions is satisfied, she does not love $ X $.\n\nYou are a big fan of Ao, and going to present her a set of non-negative integers. Currently you have a set $ A $ of non-negative integers. You want to erase (possibly zero) elements from $ A $ so that she loves the set of remaining integers. You also want to maximize the number of remaining integers. What is the largest number of remaining integers?",
