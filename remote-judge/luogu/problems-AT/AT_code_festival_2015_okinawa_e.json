    "hint": "### Problem\n\nCat Snuke received a paper that has been divided into grids having $ H $ horizontal rows and $ W $ vertical columns as a birthday gift. For each block a number is written as shown in the figure below.\n\n ![sample](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/AT_code_festival_2015_okinawa_e/7fa30057e1dc401a3ae06128e3b8a01c6792ba76.png)More precisely, the number, which is written in the $ i_{th} $ row from the top of the rectangle paper and $ j_{th} $ column from the left of the rectangle paper, is $ (i\\ -\\ 1)\\ \\times\\ W\\ +\\ (j\\ -\\ 1) $.\n\nCat Snuke wants to choose a partial rectangle from this rectangle paper, then find the value obtained by bitwise $ xor $ for all the numbers in this partial rectangle. Specifically, Cat Snuke will choose integers $ t,b(1\u2266t\u2266b\u2266H),l,r(1\u2266l\u2266r\u2266W) $, then calculate the value obtained by bitwise $ xor $ for all the numbers in the area from the top of the rectangle between the $ t_{th} $ row and the $ b_{th} $ row (including both ends), form the left of the rectangle between the $ l_{th} $ column and $ r_{th} $ column (including both ends).\n\nCat Snuke is able to choose any values for $ t,b,l,r $. Please calculate the maximum value that can be obtained.\n\n### Sample Explanation 1\n\n!\\[sample\\](https://code-festival-2015-okinawa.contest.atcoder.jp/img/other/code\\_festival\\_2015\\_okinawa/vfgagrt/E2.png)For example, the obtained value of $ t=3,b=4,l=3,r=5 $ is $ 12\\ xor\\ 13\\ xor\\ 14\\ xor\\ 17\\ xor\\ 18\\ xor\\ 19\\ =\\ 31 $, this is the maximum value that can be obtained in this case."
