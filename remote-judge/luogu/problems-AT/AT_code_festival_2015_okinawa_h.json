    "hint": "### Problem\n\nAs the end of year $ 2015 $ approaching, the downtown area has been lighted up to celebrate year\u2019s end. At this year, Cat Snuke also enjoys making a light-up device for the downtown area.\n\nThe downtown can be regarded as a one-dimensional line of numbers. There are $ N $ lights that have been installed on this number line. When the power of the $ i_{th} $ light is on, it can illuminate an interval of $ [l_i,\\ r_i] $ (inclusive).\n\nAlthough Cat Snuke can switch on the $ N $ lights independently as his wish, he wants to try different illumination combinations as many as possible. Then, if we had tried all the combinations of $ 2^N $ illumination combinations, we want to know how many different illumination combinations there are, of which each combination is a set of points that for each point in it can be illuminated by one or more lights.\n\nWhen we tried all the $ 2^N $ illumination combination, please answer the number of the different illumination combinations, modulo $ 1,000,000,007 $.\n\n### Sample Explanation 1\n\nThere are $ 16 $ different ways of attaching the light power, but there are only $ 6 $ different illumination combinations, $ \\{\u03c6\\},\\ \\{[0,\\ 1]\\},\\ \\{[1,\\ 2]\\},\\ \\{[0,\\ 2]\\},\\ \\{[1,\\ 3]\\},\\ \\{[0,\\ 3]\\} $.",
