    "hint": "### Problem\n\nThere is a $ 2 $-dimensional grid of size $ R\\ \\times\\ C $. There are many explosives warehouses on some of the cells.\n\nWhen a warehouse catches fire, it finally explodes at some time in the future. When a warehouse explodes, it blasts in a $ + $ shape with fire extending on all four side. Blast fire extends until it reaches other warehouse. Blast fire won't reach the cells behind those warehouses.\n\nA warehouse exposed to blast fire may catch fire or may not catch fire. A warehouse that once exposed to blast fire but didn't catch fire then, can be exposed to another blast fire. In that case, it's same as before, the warehouse may catch fire or may not catch fire.\n\nAn exploded warehouse won't catch fire anymore but still blocks the blast fire.\n\nAt first, you lit fire on one explosives warehouse. Finally, all warehouses had exploded.\n\nDuring that disaster, no warehouses exploded at the same time. (Some of the warehouses could have caught fire at the same time.)\n\nCalculate the number of possible ways of exploding that all warehouses explodes. As the answer can be rather large, print it as a remainder after dividing it by number $ 1000000009(10^9+9) $.\n\nWays of exploding is a set of pairs of warehouses. Each pair is a warehouse which caught fire and the warehouse which put fire on the former warehouse by exploding. When two ways of exploding have at least one different pair of warehouses, they are distinct.\n\n### Ouput Example 4\n\n```\n\n242986351\n```\n\nDon't forget to output the remainder after dividing the number by $ 1,000,000,009 $.\n\n### Sample Explanation 1\n\nFor example, there is one way of exploding like below. Including this way, there are $ 4 $ ways of exploding. !\\[\\](/img/other/code\\_festival\\_2014\\_china/G\\_sample1.png) In this way, the warehouses at $ (1,3) $ and $ (3,1) $ caught fire from warehouse at $ (1,1) $, and the warehouse at $ (3,3) $ caught fire from warehouse of $ (3,1) $\n\n### Sample Explanation 2\n\nNot all warehouses can explode in this case."
