    "description": "A \ufb01shing village built on the surface of a frozen lake far north in the arctic is endangered by global warming-fractures are starting to form on the lake surface. The village consists of n igloos of spherical shape, each occupying a circular area of the surface. \n\nAn igloo can be represented as a circle in the coordinate plane: the center of the circle is a point with integer coordinates, while the radius is a positive \ufb02oating-point number less than 1 with exactly one fractional digit. \n\nGiven the locations of possible ice fractures, the villagers would like to know how many igloos are affected by each. Formally, given q queries where each query is a straight line segment de\ufb01ned by the two endpoints, \ufb01nd the number of igloos each segment intersects. A segment intersects an igloo if it has at least one point in common with the interior of the circle.",
    "inputFormat": "The \ufb01rst line contains an integer n (1\u2264n\u2264100000) - the number of igloos. Each of the following n lines contains three numbers x, y and r \u2013 the coordinates of the center and the radius of one igloo. The coordinates x and y are integers such that 1\u2264 x, y\u2264500, while r is a \ufb02oating-point number with exactly one fractional digit such that 0 < r < 1. No two igloos will intersect or touch. \n\nThe following line contains an integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 100000) - the number of queries. Each of the following q linescontainsfourintegers x1, y1, x2, y2 (1\u2264 x1, y1, x2, y2 \u2264500)-thecoordinatesofthe two endpoints of the segment. The two endpoints will be different. Endpoints may be inside igloos. \n\nYou may assume that, for every igloo i and the segment s, the square of the distance between s and the center of i is either less than r2\u221210\u22125 or greater than r2 +10\u22125 where r is the radius of the igloo i. ",
    "outputFormat": "Output should consist of q lines. The k-th line should contain a single integer \u2013 the number of igloos that are intersected by the k-th segment.",
