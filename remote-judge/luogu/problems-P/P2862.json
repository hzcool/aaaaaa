    "description": "Farmer John wishes to build a corral for his cows. Being finicky beasts, they demand that the corral be square and that the corral contain at least C (1 <= C <= 500) clover fields for afternoon treats. The corral's edges must be parallel to the X,Y axes.\n\n\nFJ's land contains a total of N (C <= N <= 500) clover fields, each a block of size 1 x 1 and located at with its lower left corner at integer X and Y coordinates each in the range 1..10,000. Sometimes more than one clover field grows at the same location; such a field would have its location appear twice (or more) in the input. A corral surrounds a clover field if the field is entirely located inside the corral's borders.\n\n\nHelp FJ by telling him the side length of the smallest square containing C clover fields.\n\nFarmer John \u5e0c\u671b\u4e3a\u4ed6\u7684\u5976\u725b\u4eec\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u755c\u680f\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u5254\u7684\u5976\u725b\u8981\u6c42\u755c\u680f\u5fc5\u987b\u662f\u6b63\u65b9\u5f62\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u81f3\u5c11\u8981\u5305\u542b $C$ \u7247\u4e09\u53f6\u8349\uff0c\u6765\u5f53\u505a\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4e0b\u5348\u8336\u3002\n\n\u7ea6\u7ff0\u7684\u571f\u5730\u91cc\u4e00\u5171\u5305\u542b $N$ \u7247\u4e09\u53f6\u8349\uff0c\u6bcf\u5355\u4f4d\u4e09\u53f6\u8349\u4f4d\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a $1\\times 1$ \u7684\u571f\u5730\u533a\u57df\u5185\u3002\u5750\u6807\u90fd\u4e3a\u6574\u6570\uff0c\u8303\u56f4\u5728 $1$ \u5230 $10000$ \u4ee5\u5185\u3002\n\n**\u591a\u7247\u7684\u4e09\u53f6\u8349\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4f4d\u4e8e\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a $1\\times 1$ \u7684\u533a\u57df\u5185\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5185\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u5750\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u591a\u6b21\u3002**\n\n\u8bf7\u4f60\u5e2e Farmer John \u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u81f3\u5c11 $C$ \u7247\u4e09\u53f6\u8349\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u755c\u680f\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u8fb9\u957f\u662f\u591a\u5c11\u3002\n\n$1\\le C\\le N\\le 500$\u3002",
