    "description": "Hostile Bitotia launched a sneak attack on Byteotia and occupied a significant part of its territory.\n\nThe King of Byteotia, Byteasar, intends to organise resistance movement in the occupied area.\n\nByteasar naturally started with selecting the people who will form the skeleton of the movement.\n\nThey are to be partitioned into two groups:\n\nthe conspirators who will operate directly in the occupied territory, and    the support group that will operate inside free Byteotia.\n\nThere is however one issue - the partition has to satisfy the following conditions:\n\nEvery pair of people from the support group have to know each other - this        will make the whole group cooperative and efficient.\n\nThe conspirators must not know each other.\n\nNone of the groups may be empty, i.e., there has to be at least one conspirator        and at least one person in the support group.\n\nByteasar wonders how many ways there are of partitioning selected people into    the two groups.\n\nAnd most of all, whether such partition is possible at all.\n\nAs he has absolutely no idea how to approach this problem, he asks you for help.\n\n\n",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the standard input holds one integer $n$ ($2\\le n\\le 5000$),      denoting the number of people engaged in forming the resistance movement.\n\nThese people are numbered from 1 to $n$ (for the sake of conspiracy!).\n\nThe $n$ lines that follow describe who knows who in the group.\n\nThe $i$-th of these lines describes the acquaintances of the person $i$ with a sequence of integers separated by single spaces.\n\nThe first of those numbers, $k_i$ ($0\\le k_i\\le n-1$), denotes the number of acquaintances of the person $i$.\n\nNext in the line there are $k_i$ integers $a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\\cdots,a_{i,k_i}$ - the numbers of $i$'s acquaintances.The numbers $a_{i,j}$ are given in increasing order and satisfy $1\\le a_{i,j}\\le n$,$a_{i,j}\\ne i$. You may assume that if $x$ occurs in the sequence $a_i$ (i.e., among $i$'s acquaintances), then also $i$ occurs in the sequence $a_x$(i.e., among $x$'s acquaintances).\n",
    "outputFormat": "In the first and only line of the standard output your program should print out one integer:\n\nthe number of ways to partition selected people into the conspirators and the support group.\n\nIf there is no partition satisfying aforementioned conditions, then 0 is obviously the right answer.\n",
