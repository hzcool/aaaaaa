    "description": "There are initially $N-1$ pairs of friends among FJ's $N$ cows labeled $1\\dots N$, forming a tree. The cows are\nleaving the farm for vacation one by one. On day $i$, the $i$ th cow leaves the\nfarm, and then all pairs of the $i$ th cow's friends still present on the farm\nbecome friends. \n\nFor each $i$ from $1$ to $N$, just before the $i$ th cow leaves,  how many\nordered triples of distinct cows $(a,b,c)$ are there such that none of $a,b,c$\nare on vacation, $a$ is friends with $b$, and $b$ is friends with $c$?",
