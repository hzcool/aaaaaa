    "description": "Byteasar breeds hamsters.\n\nEach hamster has a unique name,    consisting of lower case letters of the English alphabet.\n\n    The hamsters have a vast and comfortable cage.\n\n    Byteasar intends to place a display under the cage to visualize the names of his hamsters.\n\n    This display is simply a sequence of letters, each of which can be either lit or not independently.\n\nOnly one name will be displayed simultaneously.\n\nThe lit letters forming the name have to stand next to each other,    i.e., form a contiguous subsequence.\n\nByteasar wants to be able to display the names of the hamsters on at least ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/cho-en-tex.1.png) different positions.\n\nHowever, he allows displaying the same name on multiple different positions,    and does not require to be able to display each and every hamster's name.\n\nNote that the occurrences of the names on the display can overlap.\n\nYou can assume that no hamster's name occurs (as a contiguous fragment) in any other hamster's name.\n\nBytesar asks your help in determining the minimum number of letters the display has to have.\n\nIn other words, you are to determine the minimum length of a string    (consisting of non-capital letters of the English alphabet)    that has at least ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/cho-en-tex.2.png) total occurrences of the hamsters' names (counting multiplicities).\n\n(We say that a string ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/cho-en-tex.3.png) occurs in the string ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/cho-en-tex.4.png) if ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/cho-en-tex.5.png) forms a contiguous fragment of ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/cho-en-tex.6.png).)\n\n",
