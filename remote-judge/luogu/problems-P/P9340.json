    "description": "JOI Kingdom is an insular country consisting of $N$ islands, numbered from $1$ to $N$. The islands are connected by $N \u2212 1$ bridges, numbered from $1$ to $N \u2212 1$. The bridge $i\\ (1 \u2264 i \u2264 N \u2212 1)$ connects the island $A_i$ and the island $B_i$ bidirectionally. It is possible to travel from any island to any other island by passing through a number of\nbridges.\nIn JOI Kingdom, there are $M$ sightseeing spots, numbered from $1$ to $M$. The sightseeing spot $j\\ (1 \u2264 j \u2264 M)$ is located in the island $C_j$.\nThere are $Q$ travelers. They plan to visit sightseeing spots in JOI Kingdom. The travelers are numbered from $1$ to $Q$. Each traveler makes a trip in the following way.\n\n1. The traveler chooses an island $x\\ (1 \u2264 x \u2264 N)$. Taking an airplane, the traveler arrives at the island $x$.\n2. The traveler takes the following actions a number of times. The order and the kinds of actions are arbitrary.\n\n    - The traveler chooses a sightseeing spot in the current island, and visits there.\n    - The traveler moves to another island by passing through a bridge.\n\n3. Taking an airplane, the traveler leaves JOI Kingdom.\n    The traveler $k\\ (1 \u2264 k \u2264 Q)$ wants to visit all of the sightseeing spots $L_k, L_{k + 1}, . . . , R_k$. However, since the budget is limited, the traveler $k$ wants to minimize the number of islands where the traveler $k$ visits at least once.\n\nWrite a program which, given information of JOI Kingdom and the travelers, calculates, for each $k\\ (1 \u2264 k \u2264 Q)$, the minimum possible number of islands where the traveler $k\u200b$ visits at least once.",
