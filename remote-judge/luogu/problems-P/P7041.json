    "description": "\n\nThe king is dead, long live the king! After the sudden death of the king Fert XIII the people of the\u00a0Flatland Kingdom are going to welcome the new king. Unfortunately, there is a problem, Fert has too\u00a0many sons.\n\nActually, he has $n$ sons and he loved each new son more than all of his previous sons. Well, probably\u00a0he just stopped loving his sons because of their bad behavior. Anyway, after the new son was born Fert\u00a0made the new testament that declared that the newly born son would be the heir.\n\nHowever, there is a problem. Only the king's son who is at least $18$ years old at the moment of the $king's\u00a0death$ can become a new king. Now the ministers of the government are trying to find the correct $new\u00a0king,$ but they seem to fail. Help them!\n\n",
    "inputFormat": "\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers: $d , m$ and $y$ -- the day, the month and the year of the\u00a0king's death, $d$ is from $1$ to $31$ , $m$ is from $1$ to $12 , y$ is from $1$ to $9999$ . It is guaranteed that there exists day $d$ in month $m$ , all months have the same number of days in Flatland as in our country, except that Flatland calendar doesn't have leap years, so February (month $2$) always has $28$ days.\n\nThe second line contains $n (1 \\le n \\le 100)$ -- the number of king's sons. The following $n$ lines contain three integers each $d_{i}, m_{i}$ and $ y_{i}$ and specify the birth dates of king's sons. All dates are correct and no\u00a0son is born after or on the day of king's death. The king had no twins, so no two sons were born on the same date.\n\n",
    "outputFormat": "\n\nOutput one integer -- the number of the son that would become the king, or $\u22121$ if none of them is $at\u00a0least 18$ years old. The sons are numbered from $1$ to $n$ in order they are described in the input. The youngest son who is at least $18$ years old at the moment of the king's death would become the king. $If\u00a0the$ son has his 18th birthday exactly on the day of the king's death, he can become a king.\n\n",
