    "description": "Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 2000) are all standing at various positions along the straight path from the barn to the pasture, which we can think of as a one-dimensional number line.  Since his cows like to stay in email contact with each-other, FJ wants to install Wifi base stations at various positions so that all of the cows have wireless coverage.\n\nAfter shopping around, FJ learns that the cost of a Wifi base station depends on distance it can transmit: a base station of power r costs A + B\\*r, where A is a fixed cost for installing the base station and B is a cost per unit of transmission distance.  If FJ installs such a device at position x, then it can transmit data to any cow located in the range x-r ... x+r.  A base station with transmission power of r=0 is allowed, but this only provides coverage to a cow located at the same position as the transmitter.\n\nGiven the values of A and B, as well as the locations of FJ's cows, please determine the least expensive way FJ can provide wireless coverage for all his cows.\n\n\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u6761\u76f4\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7684n\u4e2a\u70b9\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570A\uff0cB\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u8981\u5728\u8fd9\u6761\u76f4\u7ebf\u4e0a\u653e\u7f6e\u82e5\u5e72\u4e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5854\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5854\u6709\u4e00\u4e2ar\u503c\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5b83\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u662fx\uff0c\u5219\u5b83\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u662fx-r~x+r\uff0c\u653e\u7f6e\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5854\u7684\u82b1\u8d39\u662fA+B\\*r\uff0c\u95ee\u8981\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u7684\u70b9\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u82b1\u8d39\u662f\u591a\u5c11\u3002\n",
