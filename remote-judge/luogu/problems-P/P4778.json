    "description": "You are given a permutation p1,\u2006\u2026,\u2006pn of the numbers 1 through n. In each step you can choose two numbers x\u2004<\u2004y and swap px with py.  \n\nLet m be the minimum number of such swaps needed to sort the given permutation. Compute the number of different sequences of exactly m swaps that sort the given permutation. Since this number may be large, compute it modulo 10^9\u2005+\u20059.  ",

    "hint": "In the first test case, we can sort the permutation in two swaps. We can make the first swap arbitrarily; for each of them, there\u2019s exactly one optimal second swap. For example, one of the three shortest solutions is \u201cswap p1 with p2 and then swap p1 with p3\u201d.  \n\nIn the second test case, the optimal solution involves swapping p1 with p2 and swapping p3 with p4. We can do these two swaps in either order.  \n\nThe third sequence is already sorted. The optimal number of swaps is 0, and thus the only optimal solution is an empty sequence of swaps.  \n\u9898\u76ee\u6765\u6e90\uff1a[IPSC2016](https://ipsc.ksp.sk/2016/real/problems/c.html)",
