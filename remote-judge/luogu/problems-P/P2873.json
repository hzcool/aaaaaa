    "description": "Farmer John is leaving his house promptly at 6 AM for his daily milking of Bessie. However, the previous evening saw a heavy rain, and the fields are quite muddy. FJ starts at the point (0, 0) in the coordinate plane and heads toward Bessie who is located at (X, Y) (-500 \u2264 X \u2264 500; -500 \u2264 Y \u2264 500). He can see all N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 10,000) puddles of mud, located at points (Ai, Bi) (-500 \u2264 Ai \u2264 500; -500 \u2264 Bi \u2264 500) on the field. Each puddle occupies only the point it is on.\n\nHaving just bought new boots, Farmer John absolutely does not want to dirty them by stepping in a puddle, but he also wants to get to Bessie as quickly as possible. He's already late because he had to count all the puddles. If Farmer John can only travel parallel to the axes and turn at points with integer coordinates, what is the shortest distance he must travel to reach Bessie and keep his boots clean? There will always be a path without mud that Farmer John can take to reach Bessie.\n\n\u6e05\u65e96\uff1a00\uff0cFarmer John\u5c31\u79bb\u5f00\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u5c4b\u5b50\uff0c\u5f00\u59cb\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u4f8b\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u4e3a\u8d1d\u831c\u6324\u5976\u3002\u524d\u4e00\u5929\u665a\u4e0a\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u519c\u573a\u521a\u7ecf\u53d7\u8fc7\u4e00\u573a\u74e2\u6cfc\u5927\u96e8\u7684\u6d17\u793c\uff0c\u4e8e\u662f\u4e0d\u96be\u60f3\u89c1\uff0cFJ \u73b0\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u5927\u7247\u6ce5\u6cde\u7684\u571f\u5730\u3002FJ\u7684\u5c4b\u5b50\u5728\u5e73\u9762\u5750\u6807(0, 0)\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8d1d\u831c\u6240\u5728\u7684\u725b\u68da\u5219\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5750\u6807(X,Y) (-500 <= X <= 500; -500 <= Y <= 500)\u5904\u3002\u5f53\u7136\u54af\uff0c FJ\u4e5f\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u5730\u4e0a\u7684\u6240\u6709N(1 <= N <= 10,000)\u4e2a\u6ce5\u5858\uff0c\u7b2ci\u4e2a\u6ce5\u5858\u7684\u5750\u6807\u4e3a (A\\_i, B\\_i) (-500 <= A\\_i <= 500\uff1b-500 <= B\\_i <= 500)\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6ce5\u5858\u90fd\u53ea\u5360\u636e\u4e86\u5b83\u6240\u5728\u7684\u90a3\u4e2a\u683c\u5b50\u3002 Farmer John\u81ea\u7136\u4e0d\u613f\u610f\u5f04\u810f\u4ed6\u65b0\u4e70\u7684\u9774\u5b50\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u540c\u65f6\u60f3\u5c3d\u5feb\u5230\u8fbe\u8d1d\u831c\u6240\u5728\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6570\u90a3\u4e9b\u8ba8\u538c\u7684\u6ce5\u5858\uff0c\u4ed6\u5df2\u7ecf\u803d\u6401\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u65f6\u95f4\u4e86\u3002\u5982\u679cFarmer John \u53ea\u80fd\u5e73\u884c\u4e8e\u5750\u6807\u8f74\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ea\u5728x\u3001y\u5747\u4e3a\u6574\u6570\u7684\u5750\u6807\u5904\u8f6c\u5f2f\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u4ed6\u4ece\u5c4b\u5b50\u95e8\u53e3\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u6700\u5c11\u8981\u8d70\u591a\u5c11\u8def\u624d\u80fd\u5230\u8d1d\u831c\u6240\u5728\u7684\u725b\u68da\u5462\uff1f\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4eceFJ\u7684\u5c4b\u5b50\u5230\u725b\u68da\u603b\u662f\u5b58\u5728\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u6761\u4e0d\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4efb\u4f55\u6ce5\u5858\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002\n",
