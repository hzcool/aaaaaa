    "description": "\n\nAs you can remember, Alex is fond of origami. She switched from squares to rectangles, and rectangles\u00a0are much more difficult to master. Her main interest is to determine what is the minimum possible\u00a0number of folds required to transform $W \\times H$ rectangle to $w \\times h$ one. The result of each fold should also\u00a0be rectangular, so it is only allowed to make folds that are parallel to the sides of the rectangle.\n\nHelp Alex and write a program that determines the minimum required number of folds.\n\n",
    "inputFormat": "\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $W$ and $H$ -- the initial rectangle dimensions. The second\u00a0line contains two more integers $w$ and $h$ -- the target rectangle dimensions $(1 \\le W , H , w , h \\le 10^{9}).$\n\n",
    "outputFormat": "\n\nOutput a single integer -- the minimum required number of folds to transform the initial rectangle to\u00a0the target one.\n\nIf the required transformation is not possible, output $\u22121$ .\n\n",
