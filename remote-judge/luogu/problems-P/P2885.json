    "description": "Farmer John's cows are getting restless about their poor telephone service; they want FJ to replace the old telephone wire with new, more efficient wire. The new wiring will utilize N (2 \u2264 N \u2264 100,000) already-installed telephone poles, each with some heighti meters (1 \u2264 heighti \u2264 100). The new wire will connect the tops of each pair of adjacent poles and will incur a penalty cost C \u00d7 the two poles' height difference for each section of wire where the poles are of different heights (1 \u2264 C \u2264 100). The poles, of course, are in a certain sequence and can not be moved.\n\nFarmer John figures that if he makes some poles taller he can reduce his penalties, though with some other additional cost. He can add an integer X number of meters to a pole at a cost of X2.\n\nHelp Farmer John determine the cheapest combination of growing pole heights and connecting wire so that the cows can get their new and improved service.\n\n\u7ed9\u51fa\u82e5\u5e72\u68f5\u6811\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1a\u628a\u67d0\u68f5\u6811\u589e\u9ad8h\uff0c\u82b1\u8d39\u4e3ah\\*h\u3002\n\n\n\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b8c\u6210\u540e\u8fde\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e24\u68f5\u6811\u95f4\u82b1\u8d39\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5dee\\*\u5b9a\u503cc\u3002\n\n\n\u6c42\u4e24\u79cd\u82b1\u8d39\u52a0\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3002\n",
