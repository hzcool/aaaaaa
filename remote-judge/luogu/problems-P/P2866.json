    "description": "Some of Farmer John's N cows (1 \u2264 N \u2264 80,000) are having a bad hair day! Since each cow is self-conscious about her messy hairstyle, FJ wants to count the number of other cows that can see the top of other cows' heads.\n\nEach cow i has a specified height hi (1 \u2264 hi \u2264 1,000,000,000) and is standing in a line of cows all facing east (to the right in our diagrams). Therefore, cow i can see the tops of the heads of cows in front of her (namely cows i+1, i+2, and so on), for as long as these cows are strictly shorter than cow i.\n\nConsider this example:\n\n```\n        -\n-       -\n-   -   -\n-   -   -\n- - - - -\n- - - - - -\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nCows facing right -->\n\n```\n\nCow#1 can see the hairstyle of cows #2, 3, 4\n\nCow#2 can see no cow's hairstyle\n\nCow#3 can see the hairstyle of cow #4\n\nCow#4 can see no cow's hairstyle\n\nCow#5 can see the hairstyle of cow 6\n\nCow#6 can see no cows at all!\n\nLet ci denote the number of cows whose hairstyle is visible from cow i; please compute the sum of c1 through cN.For this example, the desired is answer 3 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 5.\n",
