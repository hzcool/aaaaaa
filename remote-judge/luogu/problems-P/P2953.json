    "description": "Bessie is playing a number game against Farmer John, and she wants you to help her achieve victory.\n\nGame i starts with an integer N\\_i (1 <= N\\_i <= 1,000,000). Bessie goes first, and then the two players alternate turns. On each turn, a player can subtract either the largest digit or the smallest non-zero digit from the current number to obtain a new number. For example, from 3014 we may subtract either 1 or 4 to obtain either 3013 or 3010, respectively. The game continues until the number becomes 0, at which point the last player to have taken a turn is the winner.\n\nBessie and FJ play G (1 <= G <= 100) games. Determine, for each game, whether Bessie or FJ will win, assuming that both play perfectly (that is, on each turn, if the current player has a move that will guarantee his or her win, he or she will take it).\n\nConsider a sample game where N\\_i = 13. Bessie goes first and takes 3, leaving 10. FJ is forced to take 1, leaving 9. Bessie takes the remainder and wins the game.\n\n\u8d1d\u831c\u548c\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5728\u73a9\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u6e38\u620f\uff0e\u8d1d\u831c\u9700\u8981\u4f60\u5e2e\u52a9\u5979\uff0e\n\n\u6e38\u620f\u4e00\u5171\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86G(1\u2264G\u2264100)\u573a\uff0e\u7b2ci\u573a\u6e38\u620f\u5f00\u59cb\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u6574\u6570Ni(l\u2264Ni\u22641,000,000)\uff0e\u6e38\n\n\u620f\u89c4\u5219\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff1a\u53cc\u65b9\u8f6e\u6d41\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u51cf\u53bb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u5b57\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6570\u7801\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u975e0\u6570\u7801\uff0e\u6bd4\u5982\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6570\u662f3014\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u53bb1\u53d8\u62103013\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u53bb4\u53d8\u62103010\uff0e\u82e5\u5e72\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u4f1a\u53d8\u62100\uff0e\u8fd9\u65f6\u5019\u4e0d\u80fd\u518d\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4e00\u65b9\u4e3a\u8f93\u5bb6\uff0e    \u8d1d\u831c\u603b\u662f\u5148\u5f00\u59cb\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0e\u5982\u679c\u8d1d\u831c\u548c\u7ea6\u7ff0\u90fd\u8db3\u591f\u806a\u660e\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u6700\u597d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0e\u8bf7\u4f60\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u540e\u7684\u8d62\u5bb6\uff0e\n\n\u6bd4\u5982\uff0c\u4e00\u573a\u6e38\u620f\u5f00\u59cb\u4e8e13.\u8d1d\u831c\u5c0613\u51cf\u53bb3\u53d8\u621010\uff0e\u7ea6\u7ff0\u53ea\u80fd\u5c0610\u51cf\u53bb1\u53d8\u62109\uff0e\u8d1d\u831c\u518d\u5c069\u51cf\u53bb9\u53d8\u62100\uff0e\u6700\u540e\u8d1d\u831c\u8d62\uff0e\n",
