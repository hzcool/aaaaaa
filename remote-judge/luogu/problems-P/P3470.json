    "description": "Byteasar has an account at The Byteotian Bit Bank (BBB in short).\n\nAt the beginning there were ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/bbb-en-tex.1.png) and at the end ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/bbb-en-tex.2.png) bythalers in the   account.\n\nEach transaction was either a deposit or a withdrawal of one bythaler.\n\nThe account's balance was never negative.\n\nA bank teller has prepared a bank statement: a strip of paper with   a sequence of pluses and minuses in it   (a plus denotes a deposit while minus a withdrawal of one bythaler).\n\nSoon it turned out, that some transactions were not entered correctly.\n\nThe bank teller cannot print another statement, but has to correct the   one already printed instead.\n\nThe statement needs not be consistent with the truth, it will suffice   if the sequence of transactions satisfies the following two conditions:\n\nthe final balance is consistent with the initial balance       and the sequence of transactions in the statement,                according to the sequence of transactions in the statement, the       account's balance was never negative.\n\nYou are to calculate the minimum amount of time the bank teller needs to   correct the bank statement.\n\nThe bank teller can:\n\nin ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/bbb-en-tex.3.png) seconds turn an arbitrarily chosen transaction to its       opposite, or                in ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/bbb-en-tex.4.png) seconds remove the last transaction and put it at the beginning of the statement.\n\nIf, for example, ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/bbb-en-tex.5.png), then --++-+-++-+-+ is a correct   statement.\n\nOn the other hand the statement ---++++++ is incorrect,   because the account's balance would become negative after the third   transaction, and furthermore the final balance should be 3, not 5.\n\nIt can be, however, corrected by turning the second to last symbol to its   opposite and placing the last transaction at the beginning of the statement.\n\nTask     Write a programme that:\n\nreads the current bank statement for Byteasar's account         (a sequence of pluses and minuses) as well as the numbers         ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/bbb-en-tex.6.png), ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/bbb-en-tex.7.png), ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/bbb-en-tex.8.png) and ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/bbb-en-tex.9.png) from the standard input.\n\nwrites out to the standard output the minimum number of seconds         needed to correct the statement in a way such that the initial         and final balance are consistent and that the balance is never         negative.\n",
