    "description": "Farmer John has N (2 <= N <= 1,500) prize milk cows conveniently numbered 1..N. His newly-painted barn has S (N <= S <= 1,000,000) stalls (conveniently numbered 1..S) in a single long line; each stall is a unit distance from its neighboring stall(s).\n\nThe cows have made their way to the stalls for a rest; cow i is in stall P\\_i. Antisocial as they are, the cows get grumpy if they are situated in stalls very close to each other, so Farmer John wants to move the cows to be as spread out as possible.\n\nFJ wants to make sure that the N - 1 distances between adjacent cows are as large as possible, and he would also like them to be similar to each other (i.e., close to equi-distant spacing).\n\nIn particular, FJ would like all distances between adjacent cows to be at most 1 different from (S - 1) / (N - 1), where integer division is used. Moreover, he would like as many of these distances as possible to be exactly equal to (S - 1) / (N - 1) [integer\n\ndivision]. Thus, with four cows and eight stalls, one can place the cows at positions 1, 3, 5, 8 or 1, 3, 6, 8 but not at 1, 2, 4, 7 or 1, 2, 4, 8.\n\nHelp FJ spread the cows as efficiently as possible by calculating and reporting the minimum total distance that the cows have to move in order to achieve proper spacing. Ignore the distance it takes for a cow to enter or exit a stall.\n\n\u7ea6\u7ff0\u6709N(2\u2264N\u22641500)\u5934\u5976\u725b\uff0cS(N\u2264S\u22641,000,000)\u4e2a\u4e00\u5b57\u6392\u5f00\u7684\u725b\u68da\uff0e\u76f8\u90bb\u725b\u68da\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6070\u597d\u4e3a1\uff0e\n\n\u5976\u725b\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u56de\u68da\u4f11\u606f\uff0c\u7b2ci\u53ea\u5976\u725b\u73b0\u5728\u5f85\u5728\u725b\u68daPi\uff0e\u5982\u679c\u4e24\u53ea\u5976\u725b\u79bb\u5f97\u592a\u8fd1\uff0c\u4f1a\u8ba9\u5976\u725b\u4eec\u53d8\u5f97\u5f88\u66b4\u8e81\uff0e\u6240\u4ee5\u7ea6\u7ff0\u60f3\u7ed9\u4e00\u4e9b\u5976\u725b\u6362\u4e00\u4e2a\u68da\uff0c\u8ba9\u5979\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d8\u5f97\u5c3d\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5c3d\u7ba1\u63a5\u8fd1\uff0e\u4ee4d=Trunc((s-1)/(n-1))\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5e0c\u671b\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u5976\u725b\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u662f\uff1a\u4e24\u53ea\u76f8\u90bb\u5976\u725b\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0ed\u4e4b\u5dee\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc71\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8ba9\u5c3d\u91cf\u591a\u7684\u95f4\u8ddd\u7b49\u4e8ed\uff0e\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e4\u53ea\u5976\u725b8\u4e2a\u68da\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c1\uff0c3\uff0c5\uff0c8\u62161\uff0c3\uff0c6\uff0c8\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5b89\u7f6e\u60c5\u51b5\u662f\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\uff0c\u800c1\uff0c2\uff0c4\uff0c7\u62161\uff0c2\uff0c4\uff0c8\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u662f\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\uff0e    \u5e2e\u52a9\u7ea6\u7ff0\u79fb\u52a8\u5976\u725b\uff0c\u8ba9\u6240\u6709\u5976\u725b\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e4b\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba9\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u5b89\u7f6e\u60c5\u51b5\u7b26\u5408\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5fc3\u610f\uff0e\n",
