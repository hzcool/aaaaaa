    "description": "  An annual bicycle rally will soon begin in Byteburg.\n\nThe bikers of Byteburg are natural long distance cyclists.\n\nLocal representatives of motorcyclists, long feuding the cyclists,  have decided to sabotage the event.\n\nThere are ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/raj-en-tex.1.png) intersections in Byteburg, connected with one way streets.\n\nStrangely enough, there are no cycles in the street network - if one can ride from  intersection ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/raj-en-tex.2.png) to intersection ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/raj-en-tex.3.png), then it is definitely impossible to get from ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/raj-en-tex.4.png) to ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/raj-en-tex.5.png).\n\nThe rally's route will lead through Byteburg's streets.\n\nThe motorcyclists plan to ride their blazing machines in the early morning of the rally day  to one intersection and completely block it.\n\nThe cyclists' association will then of course determine an alternative route  but it could happen that this new route will be relatively short,  and the cyclists will thus be unable to exhibit their remarkable endurance.\n\nClearly, this is the motorcyclists' plan - they intend to block such an intersection  that the longest route that does not pass through it is as short as \n",
    "inputFormat": "In the first line of the standard input, there are two integers, N and M(2<=N<=500 000,1<=M<=1 000 000), separated by a single space, that specify the number of intersections and streets in Byteburg. The intersections are numbered from   to  . The   lines that follow describe the street network: in the  -th of these lines, there are two integers, Ai, Bi(1<=Ai,Bi<=N,Ai<>Bi), separated by a single space, that signify that there is a one way street from the intersection no. Ai to the one no. Bi\n",
    "outputFormat": "The first and only line of the standard output should contain two integers separated by a single space.\n\nThe first of these should be the number of the intersection that the motorcyclists should block,  and the second - the maximum number of streets that the cyclists can then ride along in their rally.\n\nIf there are many solutions, your program can choose one of them arbitrarily.",
