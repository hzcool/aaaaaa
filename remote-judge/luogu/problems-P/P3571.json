    "description": "Byteasar has designed a supercomputer of novel architecture.\n\n```plain\nIt may comprise of many (identical) processing units.\n```\nEach processing unit can execute a single instruction per time unit.\n\nThe programs for this computer are not sequential but rather have a tree structure.\n\nEach instruction may have zero, one, or multiple subsequent instructions,    for which it is the parent instruction.\n\nThe instructions of the program can be executed in parallel on all available    processing units.  Moreover, they can be executed in many orders: the only    restriction is that an instruction cannot be executed unless its parent    instruction has been executed before.  For example, as many subsequent    instructions of an instruction that has been executed already can be    executed in parallel as there are processing units.\n\nByteasar has a certain program to run.  Since he likes utilizing his resources    optimally, he is wondering how the number of processing units would affect the running time.\n\nHe asks you to determine, for a given program and number of processing units,    the minimum execution time of the program on a supercomputer with this many processing units.\n\n\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e00\u68f5N\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6709\u6839\u6811\uff0c\u6839\u8282\u70b9\u4e3a1\u3002Q\u6b21\u8be2\u95ee\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e2aK\uff0c\u7528\u6700\u5c11\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6b21\u6570\u904d\u5386\u5b8c\u6574\u68f5\u6811\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u6700\u5c11\u64cd\u4f5c\u6b21\u6570\u3002\u6bcf\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc7K\u4e2a\u672a\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u70b9\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u70b9\u7684\u7236\u4eb2\u5fc5\u987b\u5728\u4e4b\u524d\u88ab\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fc7\u3002\n",
