    "description": "Johnny is a little boy - he is only three years old and enjoys playing with toy cars very much. Johnny has $n$ different cars. They are kept on a shelf so high, that Johnny cannot reach it by himself. As there is little space in his room, at no moment may there be more than $k$ toy cars on the floor.\n\nJohnny plays with one of the cars on the floor. Johnny's mother remains in the room with her son all the time. When Johnny wants to play with another car that is on the floor, he reaches it by himself. But when the toy is on the shelf, his mummy has to hand it to him. When she gives Johnny one car, she can at the same time pick any car from the floor and put it back on the shelf (so that there remains sufficient space on the floor).\n\nThe mother knows her child very well and therefore can predict perfectly which cars Johnny will want to play with. Having this knowledge, she wants to minimize the number of times she has to hand Johnny a toy from the shelf. Keeping that in mind, she has to put the toys off on the shelf extremely thoughtfully.\n\nTaskWrite a programme that:\n\nreads from the standard input the sequence of toy cars in order in which Johnny will want to play with them,calculates the minimal number of times the mother has to pick cars from the shelf,writes the result to the standard output.\n\nJasio \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ea\u6709\u4e09\u5c81\u7684\u5c0f\u7537\u5b69\uff0c\u4ed6\u559c\u6b22\u73a9\u73a9\u5177\u8f66\u3002\u4ed6\u6709 $n$ \u8f86\u73a9\u5177\u8f66\u88ab\u4fdd\u5b58\u5728\u4e66\u67b6\u4e0a\u3002\n\n\u67b6\u5b50\u4e0a\u7684\u73a9\u5177\u8f66 Jasio \u62ff\u4e0d\u5230\uff0c\u4f46\u5730\u677f\u4e0a\u7684\u4ed6\u53ef\u4ee5\u62ff\u5230\u3002Jasio \u7684\u6bcd\u4eb2\u4f1a\u5e2e Jasio \u62ff\u67b6\u5b50\u4e0a\u7684\u73a9\u5177\u8f66\u5230\u5730\u677f\u4e0a\u3002\n\n\u5730\u677f\u6700\u591a\u53ea\u80fd\u653e $k$ \u8f86\u73a9\u5177\u8f66\u3002\n\n\u5f53\u5730\u677f\u5df2\u7ecf\u653e\u4e86 $k$ \u8f86\u73a9\u5177\u8f66\u65f6\uff0cJasio \u7684\u6bcd\u4eb2\u90fd\u4f1a\u4ece\u5730\u677f\u4e0a\u5148\u62ff\u8d70\u4e00\u4e2a\u73a9\u5177\u8f66\u653e\u56de\u4e66\u67b6\uff0c\u518d\u62ff\u6765 Jasio \u60f3\u8981\u7684\u73a9\u5177\u8f66\u3002\n\n\u73b0\u5728 Jasio \u4e00\u5171\u60f3\u4f9d\u6b21\u73a9 $p$ \u4e2a\u73a9\u5177\u8f66\uff0c\u95ee Jasio \u7684\u6bcd\u4eb2\u6700\u5c11\u9700\u8981\u62ff\u51e0\u6b21\u73a9\u5177\u8f66\u3002\uff08\u53ea\u7b97\u62ff\u4e0b\u6765\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u7b97\u62ff\u4e0a\u53bb\u7684\uff09",
