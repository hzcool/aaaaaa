    "description": "In the middle of the night Bitratio turned on the lamp at the entrance to the building that Byteasar lives in.\n\nNow the strong light prevents Byteasar from sleeping.\n\nWhile the lamp does not shine directly on Byteasar's windows, it does so by reflecting in other windows.\n\nDeprived of sleep, Byteasar is becoming irritated.\n\nTo remedy that he tries to occupy his mind, but all he can think of is the light.\n\nThus Byteasar looked out the window and wondered if his neighbours suffer similar torture,    i.e., whether the light shines on their windows as well.\n\nNow that is an interesting question, at least in Byteasar's opinion.\n\nYou learn of the puzzle sooner than you would wish: unable to solve the problem all by himself,    thinking little of sleep now (be it his and yours), Byteasar calls you to ask for help.\n\nYou know him well enough to understand that you too will not get any sleep until you write a program    that solves his problem.\n\nByteasar lives in the building ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/lat-en-tex.1.png), which has ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/lat-en-tex.2.png) windows.\n\nThe lamp is situated on a wall at the very bottom of this building.\n\nOpposite the building ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/lat-en-tex.3.png), exactly 10 meters apart, there is another building, ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/lat-en-tex.4.png).\n\nThe wall of this ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/lat-en-tex.5.png)-windowed building is parallel to the wall of ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/lat-en-tex.6.png), the Byteasar's building.\n\nThe lamp light behaves like you would expect, i.e., in the way predicted by geometrical optics (or ray optics).\n\nNamely the light propagates along rays, and if a ray hits a window, it is reflected.\n\nDue to The Law of Reflection, the angle of the ray's reflection equals the angle of incidence.\n\nWe introduce coordinate systems on the the walls of the two buildings in the following way.\n\nBoth ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/lat-en-tex.7.png) axes are horizontal, while both ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/lat-en-tex.8.png) axes are vertical; the axes on both walls are identically oriented,    and the ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/lat-en-tex.9.png) points of the walls are opposite one another.\n\nThe windows (on either building) are simply rectangles with sides parallel to the axes of the coordinate system.\n\nA ray is reflected only in the interior of any window; it is absorbed on the window's boundary.\n\nIn each building, no two windows share any part of their interiors.\n\nThe lamp is located on the wall of the ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/lat-en-tex.10.png) building at the point ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/lat-en-tex.11.png),    which is neither inside nor at the boundary of any window.\n",
