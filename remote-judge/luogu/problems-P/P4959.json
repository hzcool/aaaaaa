    "description": "You are given N points in the coordinate system. They need to be covered with one or more\nrectangles, such that the following conditions are met:\n\n- The sides of each rectangle are parallel with the coordinate axes,\n- The center of each rectangle is in the origin, i.e. point (0, 0),\n- Each given point is located either inside of the rectangle or on its boundaries.\n\nOf course, it is possible to cover all the points using only one rectangle, but this rectangle\ncould have a very large surface area. Our goal is to find a selection of required rectangles\nsuch that the sum of their surface areas is minimal.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains the integer N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 5000), the number of points.\n\nEach of the following N lines contains two integers X and Y (-50 000 000 \u2264 X, Y \u2264 50 000\n000, XY \u2260 0), the coordinates of each point.\n",

    "hint": "In test cases worth 40% of total points, it will hold N \u2264 20.\n\n**Clarification of the first test case:** \u200bWe choose the rectangle whose opposite angles are the given\npoints, since it meets the conditions from the task.\n\n**Clarification of the second test case:** \u200bWe choose two rectangles with their centers in the origin. The\nfirst is of dimensions 50 x 20 and covers point (25, 10). The second is of dimensions 18 x 60 and covers the first two points. If we wanted to cover all the points using one rectangle, it would be of\ndimensions 50 x 60."
