    "description": "There are $N$ cities in JOI Kingdom, numbered from $1$ to $N$. There are $N - 1$ roads in JOI Kingdom, numbered from $1$ to $N - 1$. The road $i \\ (1 \\le i \\le N - 1)$ connects the city $A_i$ and the city $B_i$ bi-directionally. It is possible to travel from any city to any other city by passing through some of the roads.\n\nThere are checkpoints on some of the roads in JOI Kingdom. There are $M$ checkpoints, numbered from $1$ to $M$. The checkpoint $j \\ (1 \\le j \\le M)$ is located on the road $P_j$. In order to pass through it, you need to pay either one gold coin or $C_j$ silver coins.\n\nThere are $Q$ citizens in JOI Kingdom, numbered from $1$ to $Q$. The citizen $k \\ (1 \\le k \\le Q)$ has $X_k$ gold coins and $Y_k$ silver coins, and wants to travel from the city $S_k$ to the city $T_k$. Since gold coins are valuable, all the citizens want to keep as many gold coins as possible.\n\nWrite a program which, given information of the cities, the roads, the checkpoints, and the citizens in JOI Kingdom, for each $k \\ (1 \\le k \\le Q)$, determines whether it is possible for the citizen $k$ to travel from the city $S_k$ to the city $T_k$, and, if it is possible, calculates the maximum possible number of gold coins the citizen $k$ can keep.",
