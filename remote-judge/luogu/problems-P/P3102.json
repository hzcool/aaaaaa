    "description": "Farmer John has secret message that he wants to hide from his cows; the message is a string of length at least 2 containing only the characters A..Z.\n\nTo encrypt his message, FJ applies a sequence of \"operations\" to it, where an operation applied to a string S first shortens S by removing either some (but not all) of the initial characters or some (but not all) of the final characters from S, after which the original string S is attached either at the beginning or end.  For example, a single operation to the string ABC could result in eight possible strings:\n\nAABC\nABABC\nBCABC\nCABC\nABCA\nABCAB\nABCBC\nABCC\nGiven the final encrypted string, please count the number of possible ways FJ could have produced this string using one or more repeated operations applied to some source string.  Operations are treated as being distinct even if they give the same encryption of FJ's message.  For example, there are four distinct separate ways to obtain AAA from AA.\n\nPrint your answer out modulo 2014.\n\n\u519c\u6c11\u7ea6\u7ff0\u6536\u5230\u4e00\u6761\u7684\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u8bb0\u8be5\u6d88\u606f\u4e3a\u957f\u5ea6\u81f3\u5c11\u4e3a2\uff0c\u53ea\u7531\u5927\u5199\u5b57\u6bcd\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32S\uff0c\u4ed6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9S\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u5bc6\u3002\n\n\n\u4ed6\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5220\u9664S\u7684\u524d\u9762\u6216\u8005\u540e\u9762\u7684\u82e5\u5e72\u4e2a\u5b57\u7b26\uff08\u4f46\u4e0d\u5220\u5149\u6574\u4e2aS\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5269\u4e0b\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u539f\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32S\u7684\u524d\u9762\u6216\u8005\u540e\u9762\u3002\u5982\u5bf9\u4e8eS=\u2018ABC\u2019\uff0c\u5171\u67098\u603b\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\n\n\nAABC\n\nABABC\n\nBCABC\n\nCABC\n\nABCA\n\nABCAB\n\nABCBC\n\nABCC\n\n\u7ed9\u51fa\u52a0\u5bc6\u540e\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u8bf7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5171\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u79cd\u52a0\u5bc6\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002\n\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u540c\u5b57\u7b26\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u52a0\u5bc6\u65b9\u6848\u4e0d\u6b62\u4e00\u79cd\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u628aAA\u52a0\u5bc6\u6210AAA\uff0c\u5171\u67094\u79cd\u52a0\u5bc6\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5c06\u4f60\u7684\u7b54\u6848mod 2014\u540e\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\n",
