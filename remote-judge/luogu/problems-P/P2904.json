    "description": "Farmer John is herding his N cows (1 <= N <= 2,500) across the expanses of his farm when he finds himself blocked by a river. A single raft is available for transportation.\n\nFJ knows that he must ride on the raft for all crossings and that that adding cows to the raft makes it traverse the river more slowly.\n\nWhen FJ is on the raft alone, it can cross the river in M minutes (1 <= M <= 1000).  When the i cows are added, it takes M\\_i minutes (1 <= M\\_i <= 1000) longer to cross the river than with i-1 cows (i.e., total M+M\\_1 minutes with one cow, M+M\\_1+M\\_2 with two, etc.). Determine the minimum time it takes for Farmer John to get all of the cows across the river (including time returning to get more cows).\n\nFarmer John\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ed6\u7684N(1 <= N <= 2,500)\u5934\u5976\u725b\u6253\u7b97\u8fc7\u4e00\u6761\u6cb3\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u6240\u6709\u7684\u6e21\u6cb3\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6728\u7b4f\u3002 \u7531\u4e8e\u5976\u725b\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5212\u8239\uff0c\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u6e21\u6cb3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0cFJ\u5fc5\u987b\u59cb\u7ec8\u5728\u6728\u7b4f\u4e0a\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u6728\u7b4f\u4e0a\u7684\u5976\u725b\u6570\u76ee\u6bcf\u589e\u52a01\uff0cFJ\u628a\u6728\u7b4f\u5212\u5230\u5bf9\u5cb8\u5c31\u5f97\u82b1\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3002 \u5f53FJ\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u5750\u5728\u6728\u7b4f\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ed6\u628a\u6728\u7b4f\u5212\u5230\u5bf9\u5cb8\u9700\u8981M(1 <= M <= 1000)\u5206\u949f\u3002\u5f53\u6728\u7b4f\u642d\u8f7d\u7684\u5976\u725b\u6570\u76ee\u4ecei-1\u589e\u52a0\u5230i\u65f6\uff0cFJ\u5f97\u591a\u82b1M\\_i(1 <= M\\_i <= 1000)\u5206\u949f\u624d\u80fd\u628a\u6728\u7b4f\u5212\u8fc7\u6cb3\uff08\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\uff0c\u8239\u4e0a\u67091\u5934\u5976\u725b\u65f6\uff0cFJ\u5f97\u82b1M+M\\_1\u5206\u949f\u6e21\u6cb3\uff1b\u8239\u4e0a\u67092\u5934\u5976\u725b\u65f6\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c31\u53d8\u6210M+M\\_1+M\\_2\u5206\u949f\u3002\u540e\u9762\u7684\u4f9d\u6b64\u7c7b\u63a8\uff09\u3002\u90a3\u4e48\uff0cFJ\u6700\u5c11\u8981\u82b1\u591a\u5c11\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u628a\u6240\u6709\u5976\u725b\u5e26\u5230\u5bf9\u5cb8\u5462\uff1f\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5f97\u5305\u62ecFJ\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u628a\u6728\u7b4f\u4ece\u5bf9\u5cb8\u5212\u56de\u6765\u63a5\u4e0b\u4e00\u6279\u7684\u5976\u725b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\n",
