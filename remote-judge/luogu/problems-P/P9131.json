He then recruited $M (1 \\le M \\le 20)$ test-solvers, each of which rated every problem as \"easy\" or \"hard.\"\n\nHis goal is now to create a problemset arranged in increasing order of difficulty, consisting of some subset of his $N$ problems arranged in some order. There must exist no pair of problems such that some test-solver thinks the problem later in the order is easy but the problem earlier in the order is hard.\n\nCount the number of distinct nonempty problemsets he can form, modulo $10^9+7$.
