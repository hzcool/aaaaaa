    "description": "Bytel is a mobile telephony potentate. Each employee has been issued a company phone, the memory ofwhich holds the numbers of some of his co-workers (all of them have his number in their phones as well).\n\nDue to dynamic growth of their operations the board of directors intends to move company headquaters tonew office buildings. It has been decided - in order to boost work efficiency - that every pair of employeesworking in different buildings should know (reciprocally) each others phone number i.e. the memory of theircompany phone ought to hold necessary phone numbers.\n\nSimultaneously, the board have decided to rent as many office buildings as possible to ensure good workingconditions. Help the board of Bytel to plan the number of office buildings and their size in accordancewith the aforementioned requirements.\n\n## Task\n\nWrite a programme which:\n\nreads the description of employees' phone number lists from the standard input        calculates the maximal number of office buildings and their sizes, satisfying board's conditions        writes the outcome to the standard output.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the standard input consists of two integers: $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\le n \\le 100\\ 000$, $1 \\le m \\le 2\\ 000\\ 000$),separated by single spaces, denoting the number of Bytel employees and the number of pairs of employeeswho have their numbers in company phones, respectively. The employees are numbered from $1$ to $n$.\n\nEach of the following $m$ lines contains a single pair of integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \\le a_i < b_i \\le n$ for $1 \\le i \\le m$), separated by a single space, denoting that employees $a_i$ and $b_i$ have their numbers (reciprocally) in company phones' memory. Each pair of integers denoting a pair of employees shall occur once at the most in the standard input.\n",
    "outputFormat": "The first line of the standard output should contain a single integer: the maximal number of office buildingsthat Bytel should rent. The second should contain a non-decreasing sequence of positive integers, separatedby singe spaces, denoting the sizes of the office buildings (i.e. the numbers of employees working there).\n\nShould there exist more than one correct answer - write out any one of them.\n",
