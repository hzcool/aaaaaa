    "description": "The cows are so modest they want Farmer John to install covers around the circular corral where they occasionally gather. The corral has circumference C (1 <= C <= 1,000,000,000), and FJ can choose from a set of M (1 <= M <= 100,000) covers that have fixed starting points and sizes. At least one set of covers can surround the entire corral.\n\nCover i can be installed at integer location x\\_i (distance from starting point around corral) (0 <= x\\_i < C) and has integer length l\\_i (1 <= l\\_i <= C).\n\nFJ wants to minimize the number of segments he must install. What is the minimum number of segments required to cover the entire circumference of the corral?\n\nConsider a corral of circumference 5, shown below as a pair of connected line segments where both '0's are the same point on the corral (as are both 1's, 2's, and 3's).\n\nThree potential covering segments are available for installation:\n\nStart   Length\n\ni     x\\_i     l\\_i\n\n1      0       1\n\n2      1       2\n\n3      3       3\n\n0   1   2   3   4   0   1   2   3  ...\n\ncorral: +---+---+---+---+--:+---+---+---+- ...\n\n11111               1111\n\n22222222            22222222\n\n333333333333\n\n|..................| \nAs shown, installing segments 2 and 3 cover an extent of (at least) five units around the circumference.
