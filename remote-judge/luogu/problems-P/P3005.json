    "description": "Farmer John and Bessie are playing games again. This one has to do with troughs of water.\n\nFarmer John has hidden N (1 <= N <= 20) troughs behind the barn, and has filled some of them with food. Bessie has asked M (1 <= M <= 100) questions of the form, 'How many troughs from this list (which she recites) are filled?'.\n\nBessie needs your help to deduce which troughs are actually filled.\n\nConsider an example with four troughs where Bessie has asked these questions (and received the indicated answers):\n\n1) 'How many of these troughs are filled: trough 1' -->  1 trough is filled\n\n2) 'How many of these troughs are filled: troughs 2 and 3' -->  1 trough is filled\n\n3) 'How many of these troughs are filled: troughs 1 and 4' -->  1 trough is filled\n\n4) 'How many of these troughs are filled: troughs 3 and 4' -->  1 trough is filled\n\nFrom question 1, we know trough 1 is filled.\n\nFrom question 3, we then know trough 4 is empty. \n\nFrom question 4, we then know that trough 3 is filled. \n\nFrom question 2, we then know that trough 2 is empty. \n\n\u519c\u592b\u7ea6\u7ff0\u548c\u8d1d\u897f\u53c8\u5728\u73a9\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u9700\u8981\u5f88\u591a\u4e2a\u69fd\u3002\n\n\u519c\u592b\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5728\u8c37\u4ed3\u91cc\u85cf\u8d77\u6765\u4e86N\uff081<=N<=20\uff09\u4e2a\u69fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ed6\u5df2\u7ecf\u628a\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u88c5\u4e0a\u4e86\u98df\u7269\u3002\u8d1d\u897f\u4ee5\u201c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8868\u91cc\uff08\u8868\u7531\u8d1d\u897f\u63d0\u4f9b\uff09\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u4e2a\u69fd\u91cc\u6709\u98df\u7269\uff1f\u201d\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u95ee\u4e86M\uff081<=M<=100\uff09\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u8d1d\u897f\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u54ea\u51e0\u4e2a\u69fd\u91cc\u6709\u98df\u7269\uff1f\n\n\u8fd9\u91cc\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u6837\u4f8b\uff1a\n\n\n\uff081\uff09\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u69fd\u91cc\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u4e2a\u69fd\u91cc\u6709\u98df\u7269\uff1f\u2014\u20141\u4e2a\n\n\uff082\uff09\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u69fd\u91cc\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u4e2a\u69fd\u91cc\u6709\u98df\u7269\uff1f\u2014\u20141\u4e2a\n\n\uff083\uff09\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u548c\u7b2c\u56db\u4e2a\u69fd\u91cc\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u4e2a\u69fd\u91cc\u6709\u98df\u7269\uff1f\u2014\u20141\u4e2a\n\n\uff084\uff09\u5728\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u548c\u7b2c\u56db\u4e2a\u69fd\u91cc\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u4e2a\u69fd\u91cc\u6709\u98df\u7269\uff1f\u2014\u20141\u4e2a\n\n\n\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u69fd\u662f\u6709\u98df\u7269\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u7b2c\u56db\u4e2a\u69fd\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u98df\u7269\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u69fd\u662f\u6709\u98df\u7269\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4ece\u7b2c\u56db\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u69fd\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u98df\u7269\u7684\u3002\n",
