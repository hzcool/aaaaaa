    "description": "Ivan wants to play a game with you. He took all integers from $1$ to $n$ inclusive, shuffled them and then put all even numbers into array $e$ and all odd numbers into array $o$ .\n\nYour task is to find arrays $e$ and $o$ .\n\nYou can ask Ivan questions of certain kind. Each question consists of two integers $i$ and $j$ . For each question Ivan says whether $e[i] < o[j]$ or not.\n\nYou can ask at most $300 000$ questions.\n\n# Interaction Protocol\n\nFirst, the testing system writes the integer $n (1 \\le n \\le 10 000)$ -- the number of integers Ivan used.\n\nYour solution shall print requests of two types:\n\n\u2022 \u201c? i j\u201d. $1 \\le i \\le \u230an/2\u230b, 1 \\le j \\le \u2308n/2\u2309$. The testing system responds with the symbol $\u201c<\u201d$ if $e[i] < o[j]$ or with the symbol $\u201c>\u201d$ otherwise.\n\n\u2022 \u201c!\\ $e_1\\ e_2\\ \\cdots e_{\u230an/2\u230b}\\ o_1\\ o_2 \\cdots o_{\u2308n/2\u2309}$\u201d tells the values of $e$ and $o$ that your program has determined.\n\nDon't forget to flush the output after each request!\n\nYour solution must issue exactly one request of the second type, which must be the last request, and thesolution must terminate gracefully after issuing it.\n\nYour solution is allowed to issue at most $300 000$ requests of the first type.\n\nFor each test case the number $n$ is fixed and the numbers are shuffled using Java built-in shuffle functionwith fixed seed.\n\n\n",
