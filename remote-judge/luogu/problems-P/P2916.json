    "description": "Farmer John has grown so lazy that he no longer wants to continue maintaining the cow paths that currently provide a way to visit each of his N (5 <= N <= 10,000) pastures (conveniently numbered 1..N). Each and every pasture is home to one cow. FJ plans to remove as many of the P (N-1 <= P <= 100,000) paths as possible while keeping the pastures connected. You must determine which N-1 paths to keep.\n\nBidirectional path j connects pastures S\\_j and E\\_j (1 <= S\\_j <= N; 1 <= E\\_j <= N; S\\_j != E\\_j) and requires L\\_j (0 <= L\\_j <= 1,000) time to traverse. No pair of pastures is directly connected by more than one path.\n\nThe cows are sad that their transportation system is being reduced. You must visit each cow at least once every day to cheer her up. Every time you visit pasture i (even if you're just traveling\n\nthrough), you must talk to the cow for time C\\_i (1 <= C\\_i <= 1,000).\n\nYou will spend each night in the same pasture (which you will choose) until the cows have recovered from their sadness. You will end up talking to the cow in the sleeping pasture at least in the morning when you wake up and in the evening after you have returned to sleep.\n\nAssuming that Farmer John follows your suggestions of which paths to keep and you pick the optimal pasture to sleep in, determine the minimal amount of time it will take you to visit each cow at least once in a day.\n\nFor your first 10 submissions, you will be provided with the results of running your program on a part of the actual test data.\n\nPOINTS: 300\n\n\u7ea6\u7ff0\u6709N\u4e2a\u7267\u573a\uff0c\u7f16\u53f7\u4f9d\u6b21\u4e3a1\u5230N\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7267\u573a\u91cc\u4f4f\u7740\u4e00\u5934\u5976\u725b\u3002\u8fde\u63a5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7267\u573a\u7684\u6709P\u6761\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u6bcf\u6761\u9053\u8def\u90fd\u662f\u53cc\u5411\u7684\u3002\u7b2cj\u6761\u9053\u8def\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u662f\u7267\u573aSj\u548cEj\uff0c\u901a\u884c\u9700\u8981Lj\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u4e24\u7267\u573a\u4e4b\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u6761\u9053\u8def\u3002\u7ea6\u7ff0\u6253\u7b97\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5404\u7267\u573a\u8fde\u901a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53bb\u6389\u5c3d\u91cf\u591a\u7684\u9053\u8def\u3002\u00a0\n\n\u7ea6\u7ff0\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u9053\u8def\u88ab\u5f3a\u62c6\u540e\uff0c\u5976\u725b\u4f1a\u975e\u5e38\u4f24\u5fc3\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4ed6\u8ba1\u5212\u62c6\u9664\u9053\u8def\u4e4b\u540e\u5c31\u53bb\u5ffd\u60a0\u5979\u4eec\u3002\u7ea6\u7ff0\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u4ece\u4efb\u610f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7267\u573a\u51fa\u53d1\u5f00\u59cb\u4ed6\u7ef4\u7a33\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u5f53\u4ed6\u8d70\u8bbf\u5b8c\u6240\u6709\u7684\u5976\u725b\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u8fd8\u8981\u56de\u5230\u4ed6\u7684\u51fa\u53d1\u5730\u3002\u6bcf\u6b21\u8def\u8fc7\u7267\u573ai\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4ed6\u5fc5\u987b\u82b1Ci\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5976\u725b\u4ea4\u8c08\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4e4b\u524d\u5df2\u7ecf\u505a\u8fc7\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e86\uff0c\u4e5f\u8981\u7559\u4e0b\u6765\u518d\u8c08\u4e00\u6b21\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5728\u51fa\u53d1\u548c\u56de\u53bb\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u90fd\u8981\u548c\u51fa\u53d1\u5730\u7684\u5976\u725b\u8c08\u4e00\u6b21\u8bdd\u3002\u8bf7\u4f60\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ea6\u7ff0\u8981\u62c6\u9664\u54ea\u4e9b\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u8ba9\u5ffd\u60a0\u5976\u725b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5f97\u6700\u5c11\uff1f\n",
