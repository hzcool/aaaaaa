    "description": "The cows have opened a new business, and Farmer John wants to see how well they are doing. The business has been running for N (1 <= N <= 100,000) days, and every day i the cows recorded their net profit P\\_i (-1,000 <= P\\_i <= 1,000).\n\nFarmer John wants to find the largest total profit that the cows have made during any consecutive time period. (Note that a consecutive time period can range in length from one day through N days.) Help him by writing a program to calculate the largest sum of consecutive profits.\n\n\n\u5976\u725b\u4eec\u5f00\u59cb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u610f\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4e3b\u4eba\u7ea6\u7ff0\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u5b83\u4eec\u5230\u5e95\u80fd\u505a\u5f97\u591a\u597d\u3002\u8fd9\u7b14\u751f\u610f\u5df2\u7ecf\u505a\u4e86N\uff081\u2264N\u2264100,000\uff09\u5929\uff0c\u6bcf\u5929\u5976\u725b\u4eec\u90fd\u4f1a\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0b\u8fd9\u4e00\u5929\u7684\u5229\u6da6Pi\uff08-1,000\u2264Pi\u22641,000\uff09\u3002\n\n\n\u7ea6\u7ff0\u60f3\u8981\u627e\u5230\u5976\u725b\u4eec\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u671f\u95f4\u6240\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6700\u5927\u7684\u603b\u5229\u6da6\u3002\uff08\u6ce8\uff1a\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5468\u671f\u957f\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u5929\u5230\u7b2cN\u5929\uff09\u3002\n\n\n\u8bf7\u4f60\u5199\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u5927\u5229\u6da6\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ed6\u3002\n",
