    "description": "The N cows (2 <= N <= 1,000) conveniently numbered 1..N are grazing among the N pastures also conveniently numbered 1..N. Most conveniently of all, cow i is grazing in pasture i.\n\nSome pairs of pastures are connected by one of N-1 bidirectional walkways that the cows can traverse. Walkway i connects pastures A\\_i and B\\_i (1 <= A\\_i <= N; 1 <= B\\_i <= N) and has a length of L\\_i (1 <= L\\_i <= 10,000).\n\nThe walkways are set up in such a way that between any two distinct pastures, there is exactly one path of walkways that travels between them. Thus, the walkways form a tree.\n\nThe cows are very social and wish to visit each other often. Ever in a hurry, they want you to help them schedule their visits by computing the lengths of the paths between 1 <= L\\_i <= 10,000 pairs of pastures (each pair given as a query p1,p2 (1 <= p1 <= N; 1 <= p2 <= N).\n\nPOINTS: 200\n\n\u6709N(2<=N<=1000)\u5934\u5976\u725b\uff0c\u7f16\u53f7\u4e3a1\u5230W\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u540c\u6837\u7f16\u53f7\u4e3a1\u5230N\u7684\u7267\u573a\u4e0a\u884c\u8d70.\u4e3a\u4e86\u65b9 \u4fbf\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5047\u8bbe\u7f16\u53f7\u4e3ai\u7684\u725b\u6070\u597d\u5728\u7b2ci\u53f7\u7267\u573a\u4e0a.\n\n\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u7267\u573a\u95f4\u6bcf\u4e24\u4e2a\u7267\u573a\u7528\u4e00\u6761\u53cc\u5411\u9053\u8def\u76f8\u8fde\uff0c\u9053\u8def\u603b\u5171\u6709N - 1\u6761\uff0c\u5976\u725b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9053\u8def \u4e0a\u884c\u8d70.\u7b2ci\u6761\u9053\u8def\u628a\u7b2cAi\u4e2a\u7267\u573a\u548c\u7b2cBi\u4e2a\u7267\u573a\u8fde\u4e86\u8d77\u6765(1 <= A\\_i <= N; 1 <= B\\_i <= N)\uff0c\u800c\u5b83\u7684\u957f\u5ea6 \u662f 1 <= L\\_i <= 10,000.\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u4e24\u4e2a\u7267\u573a\u95f4\uff0c\u6709\u4e14\u4ec5\u6709\u4e00\u6761\u7531\u82e5\u5e72\u9053\u8def\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u76f8\u8fde.\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u7684\u9053\u8def\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u68f5\u6811.\n\n\u5976\u725b\u4eec\u5341\u5206\u5e0c\u671b\u7ecf\u5e38\u4e92\u76f8\u89c1\u9762.\u5b83\u4eec\u5341\u5206\u7740\u6025\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5e0c\u671b\u4f60\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b83\u4eec\u8ba1\u5212\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u884c\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f60\u53ea \u9700\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u51faQ(1 < Q < 1000)\u5bf9\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u2022\u6bcf\u5bf9\u70b9\u4ee5\u4e00\u4e2a\u8be2\u95eep1,p2 (1 <= p1 <= N; 1 <= p2 <= N). \u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u7ed9\u51fa.\n\n",
