    "description": "Ever the maturing businessman, Farmer John realizes that he must manage his time effectively. He has N jobs conveniently numbered 1..N (1 <= N <= 1,000) to accomplish (like milking the cows, cleaning the barn, mending the fences, and so on).\n\nTo manage his time effectively, he has created a list of the jobs that must be finished. Job i requires a certain amount of time T\\_i (1 <= T\\_i <= 1,000) to complete and furthermore must be finished by time S\\_i (1 <= S\\_i <= 1,000,000). Farmer John starts his day at time t=0 and can only work on one job at a time until it is finished.\n\nEven a maturing businessman likes to sleep late; help Farmer John determine the latest he can start working and still finish all the jobs on time.\n\n\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u540d\u5fd9\u788c\u7684\u5546\u4eba\uff0c\u7ea6\u7ff0\u77e5\u9053\u5fc5\u987b\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5b89\u6392\u4ed6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4.\u4ed6\u6709N\u5de5\u4f5c\u8981 \u505a\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u7ed9\u5976\u725b\u6324\u5976\uff0c\u6e05\u6d17\u725b\u68da\uff0c\u4fee\u7406\u6805\u680f\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684.\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u5217\u51fa\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u6e05\u5355.\u7b2ci\u5206\u5de5\u4f5c\u9700\u8981T\\_i\u5355\u4f4d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u800c \u4e14\u5fc5\u987b\u5728S\\_i\u6216\u4e4b\u524d\u5b8c\u6210.\u73b0\u5728\u662f0\u65f6\u523b.\u7ea6\u7ff0\u505a\u4e00\u4efd\u5de5\u4f5c\u5fc5\u987b\u76f4\u5230\u505a\u5b8c\u624d\u80fd\u505c \u6b62.\n\n\u6240\u6709\u7684\u5546\u4eba\u90fd\u559c\u6b22\u7761\u61d2\u89c9.\u8bf7\u5e2e\u7ea6\u7ff0\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ed6\u6700\u8fdf\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u5f00\u59cb\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba9\u6240\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u6309\u65f6\u5b8c\u6210.\uff08\u5982\u679c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\u5168\u90e8\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa-1\uff09\n",
