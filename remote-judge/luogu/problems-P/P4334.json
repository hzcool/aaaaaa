    "description": "To help capture criminals on the run, the police are introducing a new computer system. The area covered by the police contains N cities and E bidirectional roads connecting them. The cities are labelled 1 to N.\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e2e\u52a9\u6293\u6355\u9003\u72af\uff0c\u8b66\u65b9\u5f15\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u65b0\u7684\u7535\u8111\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8b66\u5bdf\u7684\u8f96\u533a\u5305\u542bN\u5ea7\u57ce\u5e02\u548cE\u6761\u53cc\u5411\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u7f16\u53f7\u662f1~N\u3002\n\nThe police often want to catch criminals trying to get from one city to another. Inspectors, looking at a map, try to determine where to set up barricades and roadblocks.
