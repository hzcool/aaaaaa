    "description": "Byteasar has had a new palace built.\n\nIt consists of ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/gas-en-tex.1.png) chambers and ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/gas-en-tex.2.png) corridors connecting them. Each corridor connects exactly two chambers.\n\nThe rooms are numbered from ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/gas-en-tex.3.png) to ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/gas-en-tex.4.png).\n\nThere is only a single entrance to the palace, which leads to chamber no. ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/gas-en-tex.5.png).\n\nFor each chamber there is exactly one route leading to it from the entrance, without turning back on the way.\n\nIn other words, the chambers and the corridors form a tree - a connected acyclic graph.\n\nThe fire marshal who is to approve the building demands placing fire extinguishers inside.\n\nThe following are his exact requirements:\n\nThe fire extinguishers should be placed in (some) chambers, and one chamber  may store any number of extinguishers.\n\nEach chamber has to be assigned one fire extinguisher, though it may be stored  in another chamber.\n\nEach fire extinguisher can be assigned to at most ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/gas-en-tex.6.png) different chambers.\n\nFor each room its assigned extinguisher is within the range of ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/gas-en-tex.7.png) corridors.\n\nByteasar has a week spot for lavish palaces, so it is no surprise he has very little money now, right after completion of another splendid palace.\n\nTherefore he is interested in the minimum number of fire extinguishers sufficient  for satisfying fire marshal's demands.\n\nByteasar\u5efa\u597d\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bab\u6bbf\u3002\n\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5bab\u6bbf\u6709n\u4e2a\u623f\u95f4\uff0c\u7531n-1\u6761\u8d70\u5eca\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d70\u5eca\u8fde\u63a5\u4e24\u4e2a\u623f\u95f4\u3002\n\n\u623f\u95f4\u7f16\u53f7\u75311\u5230n \uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u5bab\u6bbf\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5165\u53e3\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u623f\u95f4\u90fd\u6709\u4e00\u6761\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u5230\u8fbe\u3002\n\n\u6362\u53e5\u8bdd\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u68f5\u6811\n\n\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\u8981\u5728\u8fd9\u68f5\u6811\u4e0a\u653e\u706d\u706b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u9075\u5faa\u4ee5\u4e0b\u89c4\u5219\uff1a\n\n1.\u6bcf\u4e2a\u70b9\u81f3\u5c11\u9700\u8981\u88ab\u4e00\u4e2a\u706d\u706b\u5668\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e2a\u706d\u706b\u5668\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u70b9\u4e0a\n\n2.\u6bcf\u4e2a\u706d\u706b\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u6700\u591a\u8986\u76d6s\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u70b9\n\n3.\u6bcf\u4e2a\u706d\u706b\u5668\u6700\u8fdc\u53ef\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e3ak\u7684\u70b9\n\n\u73b0\u5728Byteasar\u5f88\u7a77\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8ba9\u4f60\u6c42\u51fa\u6700\u5c11\u9700\u8981\u653e\u7f6e\u591a\u5c11\u706d\u706b\u5668\u3002\n",
