The journey consisted of $n$ segments. In the $i^{th}$ segment she traveled a distance of $d_{i}$ and the speedometer read $s_{i}$ for the entire segment. This whole journey took time $t$ . Help Sheila by computing $c$ .\n\nNote that while Sheila's speedometer might have negative readings, her true speed was greater than zero for each segment of the journey.\n\n",
    "inputFormat": "\n\nThe first line of input contains two integers $n (1 \\le n \\le 1 000)$ , the number of sections in Sheila's journey, and $t (1 \\le t \\le 10^{6}),$ the total time. This is followed by $n$ lines, each describing one segment of Sheila's journey. The $i^{th}$ of these lines contains two integers $d_{i} (1 \\le d_{i} \\le 1 000)$ and $s_{i} (|s_{i}| \\le 1 000)$ , the distance and speedometer reading for the $i^{th}$ segment of the journey. Time is specified in hours, distance in miles, and speed in miles per hour.\n\n",
