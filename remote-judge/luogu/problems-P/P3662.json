    "description": "The long road through Farmer John's farm has $N$ crosswalks across it, conveniently numbered $1 \\ldots N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 100,000$). To allow cows to cross at these crosswalks, FJ installs electric crossing signals, which light up with a green cow icon when it is ok for the cow to cross, and red otherwise. Unfortunately, a large electrical storm has damaged some of his signals. Given a list of the damaged signals, please compute the minimum number of signals that FJ needs to repair in order for there to exist some contiguous block of at least $K$ working signals.\n\n\u5171\u6709N\u4e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\u706f\uff0c\u7f16\u53f7\u4e3a1~N\uff0c\u6709B\u4e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\u706f\u635f\u574f\uff0c\u7ed9\u4f60\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u7f16\u53f7\u3002\n\n\n\u95ee\uff0c\u6700\u5c11\u4fee\u597d\u51e0\u4e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\u706f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709K\u4e2a\u7f16\u53f7\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u706f\u3002\n",
