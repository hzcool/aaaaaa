To keep the peace, he gives a tasty treat to every cow that he meets along his way and, of course, FJ is so frugal that he would like to encounter as few cows as possible.\n\n\u519c\u592b\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5fc5\u987b\u9001\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u88f9\u7ed9\u519c\u592b\u4e39\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u5907\u53bb\u65c5\u884c\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u5e73\uff0c\u4ed6\u5fc5\u987b\u7ed9\u6bcf\u4e00\u5934\u9047\u5230\u7684\u5976\u725b\u4e00\u4e9b\u5403\u7684\uff0c\u5f53\u7136\uff0cFJ\u5f88\u8282\u4fed\uff0c\u4ed6\u60f3\u53ef\u80fd\u9047\u5230\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u5c11\u7684\u5976\u725b\u3002\n\nFJ has plotted a map of N (1 <= N <= 50,000) barns, connected by M (1 <= M <= 50,000) bi-directional cow paths, each with C\\_i (0 <= C\\_i <= 1,000) cows ambling along it.
