    "description": "As you probably know, a tree is a graph consisting of $n$ nodes and $n - 1$ undirected edges in which any two nodes are connected by exactly one path. In a labeled tree each node is labeled with a different integer between $1$ and $n$. In general, it may be hard to visualize trees nicely, but some trees can be\nneatly embedded in rectangular grids.\n\nGiven a labeled tree $G$ with $n$ nodes, a $2$ by $n$ embedding of $G$ is a mapping of nodes of $G$ to the cells of a rectangular grid consisting of $2$ rows and $n$ columns such that:\n   - Node $1$ is mapped to the cell in the upper-left corner.\n   - Nodes connected with an edge are mapped to neighboring grid cells (up, down, left or right).\n   - No two nodes are mapped to the same cell.\n\nFind the number of $2$ by $n$ embeddings of a given tree, modulo $10^9 + 7$.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $n(1 \\le n \\le 300 000)$ \u2014 the number of nodes in $G$. The $j-th$ of the following $n - 1$ lines contains two different integers $a_j$ and $b_j(1 \\le a_j,b_j \\le n)$ \u2014 the endpoints of the $j-th$ edge.\n",
