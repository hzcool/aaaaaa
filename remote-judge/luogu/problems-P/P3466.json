    "description": "Byteasar loved to play with building blocks as a child.\n\nHe used to arrange the blocks into $n$ columns of random height  and then organize them in the following manner:\n\nByteasar would choose a number $k$ and try to arrange the blocks in such a way that  some $k$ consecutive columns would be of equal height. Furthermore he always tried to  achieve this goal in a minimum number of moves possible, where a single move consists in:\n\nlaying one block on top of any column      (Byteasar had a huge box with spare blocks, ensuring this move could always be performed),      or              removing the uppermost block from the top of any column.\n\nHowever, Byteasar was never quite sure if his sequence of moves was indeed optimal,  therefore he has asked you to write a programme that will help him solve the problem.\n\nTask    Write a programme that:\n\nreads the number $k$ along with the initial setup of the blocks from the standard input,determines the optimal solution (shortest possible sequence of moves),writes out the solution to the standard output.\n\n\u6709 $n$ \u67f1\u7816,\u6bcf\u67f1\u7816\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u73b0\u5728\u5e0c\u671b\u6709\u8fde\u7eed $k$ \u67f1\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u662f\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e24\u4e2a\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1a\n\n1:\u4ece\u67d0\u67f1\u7816\u7684\u9876\u7aef\u62ff\u4e00\u5757\u7816\u51fa\u6765,\u4e22\u6389\u4e0d\u8981\u4e86\u3002\n\n2:\u4ece\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u62ff\u51fa\u4e00\u5757\u7816,\u653e\u5230\u53e6\u4e00\u67f1\uff0c\u4ed3\u5e93\u662f\u65e0\u9650\u5927\u7684\u3002\n\n\u73b0\u5728\u5e0c\u671b\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9664\u6b64\u4e4b\u5916\u4f60\u8fd8\u8981\u6c42\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u675f\u72b6\u6001\u65f6,\u6bcf\u67f1\u7816\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3002\n",
