    "description": "\n\nAnna has just finished her course project. She has a lot of seven-segment LED displays as leftovers and a small power source. Each display consumes power proportionally to the number of lit segments, e.g . $\u20189'$ consumes twice more power than $\u20187'.$\n\n![](https://onlinejudgeimages.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/problem/15131/1.png)\n\nAnna wonders what is the maximum possible sum of digits she is able to achieve, if her power source is able to light $n$ segments, and she wants to light exactly $n$ segments.\n\n",
