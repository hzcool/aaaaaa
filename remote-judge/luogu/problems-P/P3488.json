    "description": "Byteasar runs a skate club. Its members meet on a regular basis and train    together, and they always use the club's ice-skates. The skate sizes are    (by convention) numbered from ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.1.png) to ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.2.png). Naturally, each club member has    some foot size, but that is not all to it! Skaters have skate size tolerance    factor ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.3.png): a skater with foot size ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.4.png) can wear skates with    sizes from ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.5.png) up to ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.6.png). It should be noted, though, that    no skater ever wears two skates of different size simultaneously.\n\nTo supply the club, Byteasar bought ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.7.png) pairs of ice-skates of each size,    i.e. from ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.8.png) to ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.9.png). As time passes, some people join the club, just as    some established members leave it. Byteasar worries if he will have enough    skates of appropriate size for every member at each training.\n\nWe assume that initially the club has no members at all. Byteasar will give    you a sequence of ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.10.png) events of the following form: ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.11.png) (new) members with    foot size ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.12.png) have joined/left the club. Right after each such event    Byteasar wants to know whether he has enough skates of appropriate size for    every club member. He asks you to write a programme that will check it for    him.\n",
