    "description": "Lately, Slavko\u2019s been studying sequences of natural numbers. He finds a sequence\ninteresting if the greatest common divisor of all the elements from the sequence is greater\nthan 1.\n\nYesterday, he found a sequence consisting of N natural numbers in his garage. Since he\nwas really bored, he decided to keep himself occupied by asking simple queries. Each query\ncan be one of the two types:\n\n1. Change the value at position X in the sequence to V.\n\n2. Determine the number of interesting contiguous subarrays contained in the interval\n[L, R] of the sequence.\n",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains the numbers N and Q (1 \u2264 N, Q \u2264 $10^5$\n), representing the\nnumber of elements in the sequence and the number of queries, respectively.\n\nThe following line contains N natural numbers $A_i$\n(1 \u2264 $A_i$ \u2264 $10^9$\n) that represent the numbers in\nthe initial sequence.\n\nEach of the following Q lines contains a query of the following form:\n\n - The first number in the line can be 1 or 2 and represents the type of the query.\n - If the query is of type 1, two numbers follow, X (1 \u2264 X \u2264 N) and V (1 \u2264 V \u2264 $10^9$\n) from\nthe task.\n - If the query is of type 2, two numbers follow, L and R (1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N) that represent\nthe left and right interval boundary.\n",
