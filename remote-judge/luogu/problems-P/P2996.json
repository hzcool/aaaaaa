The cows have set up quite an unusual road network with exactly N-1 roads connecting pairs of cows C1 and C2 (1 <= C1 <= N; 1 <= C2 <= N; C1 != C2) in such a way that there exists a unique path of roads between any two cows.\n\nFJ wants Bessie to come back to the farm soon; thus, he has instructed Bessie that if two cows are directly connected by a road, she may not visit them both. Of course, Bessie would like her vacation to be as long as possible, so she would like to determine the maximum number of cows she can visit.\n\n\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e86\u51e0\u5468\u7684\u8f9b\u82e6\u5de5\u4f5c,\u8d1d\u831c\u7ec8\u4e8e\u8fce\u6765\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5047\u671f.\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5976\u725b\u7fa4\u4e2d\u6700\u4f1a\u793e\u4ea4\u7684\u725b,\u5979\u5e0c\u671b\u53bb\u62dc\u8bbfN(1<=N<=50000)\u4e2a\u670b\u53cb.\u8fd9\u4e9b\u670b\u53cb\u88ab\u6807\u53f7\u4e3a1..N.\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5976\u725b\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5bfb\u5e38\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf,\u91cc\u9762\u6709N-1\u6761\u8def,\u6bcf\u6761\u8def\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u4e00\u5bf9\u7f16\u53f7\u4e3aC1\u548cC2\u7684\u5976\u725b(1 <= C1 <= N; 1 <= C2 <= N; C1<>C2).\u8fd9\u6837,\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u5bf9\u5976\u725b\u4e4b\u95f4\u90fd\u6709\u4e00\u6761\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u901a\u8def.

The best combinations include two cows on the top row and two on the bottom. She can't visit cow 6 since that would preclude visiting cows 5 and 7; thus she visits 5 and 7. She can also visit two cows on the top row: {1,3}, {1,4}, or {2,4}.\n"
