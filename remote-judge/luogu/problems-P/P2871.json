    "description": "Bessie has gone to the mall's jewelry store and spies a charm bracelet. Of course, she'd like to fill it with the best charms possible from the N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 3,402) available charms. Each charm i in the supplied list has a weight Wi (1 \u2264 Wi \u2264 400), a 'desirability' factor Di (1 \u2264 Di \u2264 100), and can be used at most once. Bessie can only support a charm bracelet whose weight is no more than M (1 \u2264 M \u2264 12,880).\n\nGiven that weight limit as a constraint and a list of the charms with their weights and desirability rating, deduce the maximum possible sum of ratings.\n\n\u6709 $N$ \u4ef6\u7269\u54c1\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e3a $M$ \u7684\u80cc\u5305\u3002\u7b2c $i$ \u4ef6\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u91cd\u91cf\u662f $W_i$\uff0c\u4ef7\u503c\u662f $D_i$\u3002\u6c42\u89e3\u5c06\u54ea\u4e9b\u7269\u54c1\u88c5\u5165\u80cc\u5305\u53ef\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u91cd\u91cf\u603b\u548c\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc7\u80cc\u5305\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u4ef7\u503c\u603b\u548c\u6700\u5927\u3002",
