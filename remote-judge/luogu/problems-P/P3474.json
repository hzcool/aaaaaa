    "description": "Byteasar is going to buy an industrial plot.\n\nHis fortune is estimated at ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/kup-en-tex.1.png) bythalers and this is exactly the amount    Byteasar would like to spend on the parcel.\n\nFinding a parcel worth exactly ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/kup-en-tex.2.png) bythalers, however, is not an easy task.\n\nFor this reason Byteasar is ready to buy a more expensive plot.\n\nHe considers taking out a loan. The Byteotian Credit Bank will grant him    a loan of up to ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/kup-en-tex.3.png) bythalers. Thus, Byteasar can spend no more than ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/kup-en-tex.4.png)    bythalers on the parcel and he would like to spend no less than ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/kup-en-tex.5.png)    bythalers.\n\nThe area in which Byteasar wants to buy his parcel is a square with side    length of ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/kup-en-tex.6.png) metres.\n\nThe current landlords have set up various prices per square metre.\n\nByteasar has spoken to each one of them and has then prepared a price map    of the area.\n\nThe map depicts the price of every metre by metre square. Clearly, there    are ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/kup-en-tex.7.png) such squares.\n\nNow is the time to find the dream parcel.\n\nIt has to be rectangular and consist of whole unit squares.\n\nByteasar has already started looking for the plot on the map,    but after many hours he was still unable to find a suitable one.\n\nBe a chap and help him!\n\nTask      Write a programme that:\n\nreads the numbers ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/kup-en-tex.8.png) and ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/kup-en-tex.9.png) from the standard input,              along with the price map of the area,             determines a parcel with price in the interval ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI15/kup-en-tex.10.png)              or states that no such parcel exists,             writes out the result to the standard output.\n\n\u7ed9\u5b9ak,n,\u548cn\\*n\u7684\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u6c42\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b50\u77e9\u5f62\u6ee1\u8db3\u6743\u503c\u548c\u5728[k,2k]\u4e4b\u95f4\n\n$n<2000$,$1\\le k\\le10^9$,\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ef7\u683c\u90fd\u662f\u4e0d\u5927\u4e8e$2*10^9$\u7684\u975e\u8d1f\u6574\u6570\n\n\u611f\u8c22@cn\uff1a\u82cf\u537f\u5ff5 \u63d0\u4f9b\u7684spj\n",
