    "description": "Byteasar works as a ticket inspector in a Byteotian National Railways (BNR)    express train that connects Byteburg with Bitwise.\\n\\nThe third stage of the BNR reform (The never ending saga of BNR reforms and the Bitwise hub was presented in the problems Railway from the third stage of XIV Polish OI and Station from the third stage of XV Polish OI. Their        knowledge, however, is not required at all in order to solve this        problem.) has begun. In particular, the salaries system has already been changed.\\n\\nFor example, to encourage Byteasar and other ticket inspectors to    efficient work,    their salaries now depend on the number of tickets (passengers) they    inspect. Byteasar is able to control all the passengers on the train in the    time between two successive stations, but he is not eager to waste his    energy in doing so. Eventually he decided he would check the tickets exactly    ![](//static.oiinhand.info/e8b9244e-111d-4c70-b92c-27c7eb2ad3ea) times per ride.\\n\\nBefore setting out, Byteasar is given a detailed summary from which he knows    exactly how many passengers will travel from each station to another. Based    on that he would like to choose the moments of control in such a way that    the number of passengers checked is maximal. Obviously, Byteasar is not    paid extra for checking someone multiple times - that would be pointless,    and would only disturb the passengers. Write a programme that will determine    for Byteasar when he should check the tickets in order to maximise his    revenue.\n\n\u6709n\u4e2a\u8f66\u7ad9\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u6709\u4e00\u8f86\u706b\u8f66\u4ece1\u5230n\u9a76\u8fc7\uff0c\u7ed9\u51faaij\u4ee3\u8868\u4ecei\u7ad9\u4e0a\u8f66j\u7ad9\u4e0b\u8f66\u7684\u4eba\u7684\u4e2a\u6570\u3002\u5217\u8f66\u884c\u9a76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f60\u6709K\u6b21\u68c0\u7968 \u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u5f53\u524d\u5728\u8f66\u4e0a\u7684\u4eba\u4f1a\u88ab\u68c0\u7968\uff0c\u95ee\u6700\u591a\u80fd\u68c0\u591a\u5c11\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4eba\u7684\u7968",
