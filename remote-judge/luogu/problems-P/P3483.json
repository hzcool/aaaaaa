    "description": "In the capital of Byteotia, Bytau, the layout of streets is highly regular.\n\nEvery street leads either from north to south, or from east to west.\n\nTherefore every north-south street intersects every east-west street    in exactly one spot. Furthermore, along every street its successive intersections    are exactly 1 km apart.\n\nBytau is not only the capital, but also one of the oldest cities in Byteotia.\n\nNo wonder that there are as many as ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/str-en-tex.1.png) historic buildings, each at one of the    intersections.\n\nThe City Council cares for their protection very much, and is now concerned    with the risk of fire. Hence they have decided to establish two main fire stations    in the city.\n\nEach monument is going to be protected by the nearest station; by both,    should both fire stations be equally close.\n\nHousing is very dense in Bytau, so Euclidean distance is not the measure of choice.\n\nThe distance between a monument and fire station should rather be defined as the    length of the shortest path along the streets between them.\n\nThe City Council has prepared several projects of the stations' location.\n\nAnd you have been asked to determine, for each of them, the number of monuments    protected by: the first station only, the second station only, and both stations,    respectively.\n\n\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u6709z\u4e2a\u70b9\uff0c\u7ed9\u4f60p\u4e2a\u5f62\u5982 p1(x1,y1),p2(x2,y2) \u7684\u8be2\u95ee\uff0c\u8981\u4f60\u6c42\u51faz\u4e2a\u70b9\u4e2d\u79bbp1\u66f4\u8fd1\u7684\u70b9\uff0c\u79bbp2\u66f4\u8fd1\u7684\u70b9\uff0c\u4e0ep1\u548cp2\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u7b49\u7684\u70b9\u5404\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u4e2a\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6307\u7684\u662f\u66fc\u54c8\u987f\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5373x\u5750\u6807\u4e4b\u5dee\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c\u52a0\u4e0ay\u5750\u6807\u4e4b\u5dee\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c\u3002\n",
