    "description": "It's a hot summer day, and Bessie the cow is feeling quite lazy.  She wants\n\nto locate herself at a position in her field so that she can reach as much\n\ndelicious grass as possible within only a short distance.\n\n\nThe field Bessie inhabits is described by an N by N grid of square cells\n\n(1 <= N <= 400).  The cell in row r and column c (1 <= r,c <= N) contains\n\nG(r,c) units of grass (0 <= G(r,c) <= 1000).  From her initial square in\n\nthe grid, Bessie is only willing to take up to K steps (0 <= K <= 2\\*N).\n\nEach step she takes moves her to a cell that is directly north, south,\n\neast, or west of her current location.\n\n\nFor example, suppose the grid is as follows, where (B) describes Bessie's\n\n```cpp\n50    5     25*   6     17    \n14    3*    2*    7*    21    \n99*   10*   1*(B) 2*    80*    \n8     7*    5*    23*   11   \n10    0     78*   1     9        \n```\n\ninitial position (here, in row 3, column 3):\n\nIf K=2, then Bessie can only reach the locations marked with \\*s.\n\nPlease help Bessie determine the maximum amount of grass she can reach, if\n\nshe chooses the best possible initial location in the grid.\n\n\u5976\u725b\u8d1d\u831c\u975e\u5e38\u61d2\u60f0\uff0c\u5979\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u5979\u7684\u5730\u76d8\u5185\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u70b9\u6700\u4f73\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5c45\u4f4f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6b65\u6570\u5185\u53ef\u4ee5\u5403\u5230\u5c3d\u91cf\u591a\u7684\u9752\u8349\u3002\n\n\u5979\u7684\u5730\u76d8\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a $N \\times N(1\\le N \\le 400)$ \u7684\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u7b2c $r$ \u884c $c$ \u5217\u5305\u542b $G(r,c)$ \u5355\u4f4d\u7684\u9752\u8349 $(0 \\le G(r,c) \\le 1000)$\u3002\u4ece\u5979\u7684\u5c45\u4f4f\u70b9\uff0c\u5979\u6700\u591a\u613f\u610f\u8d70 $K$ \u6b65 $(0 \\le K \\le 2 \\times N)$\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u5979\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d70\u5230\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5979\u76f8\u90bb\u7684\u67d0\u4e2a\u683c\u5b50\u3002",
