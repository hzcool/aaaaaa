    "description": "Byteasar has a cottage. Lately, he has bought $n$ trees and had them planted all in one row. Byteasar does not,  however, like the order which the trees have been planted in. It particularly annoys him that tall and short  ones have been mixed up, and the composition does not meet his aesthetic criteria.\n\nByteasar has invented a disorder coefficient so as to allow the gardener to comprehend his intentions: thelower the value of the coefficient the prettier the row of trees. It is defined in the following way:\n\n$|h_1-h_2|+|h_2-h_3|+\\cdots+|h_{n-1}-h_n|$, where $h_1,h_2,\\cdots,h_n$ are the heights of consecutive trees in a row.\nReplanting is a very toilsome and cumbersome task, therefore Byteasar has ordered the gardener to replanttwo trees at the most (i.e. interchange their positions). The task of the gardener is to choose the pair to replantin a way that makes the disorder coefficient the smallest.\n\nThe gardener is not sure if he has chosen the correct pair of trees and he fears he may lose his job ifhe is mistaken. Help him: for each tree calculate the minimal disorder coefficient that may be attained byswitching places with any other tree.\n\nTaskWrite a programme which:\n\nreads the height of the consecutive trees in a row from the standard input,        for each tree calculates the minimal disorder coefficient that may be attained should it switch places    with some other tree (or should there be no change at all),        writes the outcome to the standard output.\n\nCDQZ\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u504f\u8fdc\u7684\u5c0f\u5b66\u6821\uff0cFGD\u5728\u5b66\u6821\u91cc\u4e2d\u4e86\u4e00\u6392\u6811\u3002\u4ed6\u5374\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6811\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u9ad8\u9ad8\u77ee\u77ee\u663e\u5f97\u90a3\u4e48\u53c2\u5dee\u4e0d\u9f50\u3002 FGD\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6811\u7684\u4e0d\u6574\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e3a\u76f8\u90bb\u4e24\u6811\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5dee\u7684\u548c\u3002\u8bbe\u6811\u9ad8\u5206\u522b\u4e3ah1,h2,h3,\u2026,hn\u3002\u90a3\u4e48\u4e0d\u6574\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\uff1a|h1-h2|+|h2-h3|+\u2026\u2026+|hn-1-hn|\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u683d\u79cd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6811\u662f\u4e00\u4ef6\u9ebb\u70e6\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5FGD\u6700\u591a\u53ea\u60f3\u4ea4\u6362\u5176\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2a\u6811\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u8bf7\u4f60\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ed6\uff0c\u4ed6\u5e94\u8be5\u600e\u4e48\u4ea4\u6362\u4f7f\u5f97\u6574\u4e2a\u4e00\u6392\u6811\u7684\u4e0d\u6574\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6700\u5c0f\u3002\n",
