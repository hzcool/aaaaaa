    "description": "There are exactly $n$ towns in Byteotia.\n\nSome towns are connected by bidirectional roads.\n\nThere are no crossroads outside towns, though there may be bridges,    tunnels and flyovers. Each pair of towns may be connected by at most    one direct road. One can get from any town to any other-directly    or indirectly.\n\nEach town has exactly one citizen.\n\nFor that reason the citizens suffer from loneliness.\n\nIt turns out that each citizen would like to pay a visit to    every other citizen (in his host's hometown), and do it    exactly once. So exactly $n\\cdot (n-1)$ visits should take place.\n\nThat's right, should.\n\nUnfortunately, a general strike of programmers, who    demand an emergency purchase of software, is under way.\n\nAs an act of protest, the programmers plan to block one town of    Byteotia, preventing entering it, leaving it, and even passing through.\n\nAs we speak, they are debating which town to choose so that    the consequences are most severe.\n\nTask    Write a programme that:\n\nreads the Byteotian road system's description from the            standard input,           for each town determines, how many visits could take place            if this town were not blocked by programmers,           writes out the outcome to the standard output.\n\n\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e00\u5f20\u65e0\u5411\u56fe\uff0c\u6c42\u6bcf\u4e2a\u70b9\u88ab\u5c01\u9501\u4e4b\u540e\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u4e2a\u6709\u5e8f\u70b9\u5bf9(x,y)(x!=y,1<=x,y<=n)\u6ee1\u8db3x\u65e0\u6cd5\u5230\u8fbey\n",
