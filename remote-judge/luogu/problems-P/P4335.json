    "description": "The president of the political party in power is holding a conference in the party headquarters.\nPoliticians, members of the party, live in a two-dimensional grid, one member in each cell (except in cells containing obstacles). The headquarters are located in cell (0, 0). This is also where the president of the party lives.\n\n\u6267\u653f\u515a\u7684\u603b\u4e66\u8bb0\u6b63\u5728\u4eba\u6c11\u5927\u4f1a\u5802\u4e3e\u884c\u4f1a\u8bae\u3002\u515a\u5458\u4eec\u90fd\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5e73\u9762\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u515a\u5458\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u683c\u5b50\u4e2d\uff08\u9664\u4e86\u542b\u6709\u969c\u788d\u7684\u683c\u5b50\uff09\u3002\u4f1a\u5802\u4f4d\u4e8e\uff080,0\uff09\uff0c\u662f\u603b\u4e66\u8bb0\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\n\nPoliticians make steps in one of the four directions (up, down, left, right), moving to one of the four adjacent cells in one step.
