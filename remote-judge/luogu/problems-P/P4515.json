The display is initially\nwhite. During each of the $N$ parts of the testing phase, Mirko attached three\nelectrodes to the display in such way that they formed a right isosceles\ntriangle. He noticed that, after attaching the electrodes, all pixels in the\nenclosing triangle are inverted (white pixels become black, and black pixels\nbecome white).\n\nWatching Mirko play with the electrodes, Slavko observed interesting shapes\nemerging on the screen. Mathematically inclined as he is, first thing that\ncrossed his mind was how to calculate total area covered by black pixels. Help\nhim by writing a program to do just that!",
