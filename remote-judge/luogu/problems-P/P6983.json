    "description": "\n\nKing Karl is a responsible and diligent ruler. Each year he travels across his country to make certain that all cities are doing well.\n\nThere are $n$ cities in his country and $m$ roads. In order to control the travelers, each road is unidirectional, that is a road from city a to city $b$ can not be passed from $b$ to a .\n\n![](https://onlinejudgeimages.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/problem/11745/1.png)\n\nKarl wants to travel along the roads in such a way that he starts in the capital, visits every non-capital city exactly once, and finishes in the capital again.\n\nAs a transport minister, you are obliged to find such a route, or to determine that such a route doesn't exist.\n\n",
    "inputFormat": "\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m (2 \\le n \\le 100 000 , 0 \\le m \\le n + 20)$ -- the number of cities and the number of roads in the country.\n\nEach of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $a_{i}$ and $b_{i} (1 \\le a_{i}, b_{i} \\le n)$ , meaning that there is a one-way road from city $a_{i}$ to city $b_{i}.$ Cities are numbered from $1$ to $n$ . The capital is numbered as $1$ .\n\n",

Do output the capital city both in the beginning and in the end of the route.\n\nIf there is no desired route, output `There is no route, Karl!` (without quotation marks).\n\n",
