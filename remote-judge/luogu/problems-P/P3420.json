    "description": "Byteazar the Dragon has $N$ piggy banks. Each piggy bank can either be opened with its corresponding key or smashed. Byteazar has put the keys in some of the piggy banks - he remembers which key has been placed in which piggy bank. Byteazar intends to buy a car and needs to gain access to all of the piggy banks. However, he wants to destroy as few of them as possible. Help Byteazar to determine how many piggy banks have to be smashed.\n\nTaskWrite a programme which:\n\nreads from the standard input the number of piggy banks and the deployment of their corresponding keys,finds the minimal number of piggy banks to be smashed in order to gain access to all of them,writes the outcome to the standard output.\n\nByteazar the Dragon\u62e5\u6709N\u4e2a\u5c0f\u732a\u5b58\u94b1\u7f50\u3002\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b58\u94b1\u7f50\u80fd\u591f\u7528\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u94a5\u5319\u6253\u5f00\u6216\u8005\u88ab\u7838\u5f00\u3002Byteazar\u5df2\u7ecf\u5c06\u94a5\u5319\u653e\u5165\u5230\u4e00\u4e9b\u5b58\u94b1\u7f50\u4e2d\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u6bcf\u4e2a\u94a5\u5319\u6240\u5728\u7684\u5b58\u94b1\u7f50\uff0cByteazar\u60f3\u8981\u4e70\u4e00\u8f86\u5c0f\u6c7d\u8f66\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u6253\u5f00\u6240\u6709\u7684\u5b58\u94b1\u7f50\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4ed6\u60f3\u8981\u7834\u574f\u5c3d\u91cf\u5c11\u7684\u5b58\u94b1\u7f50\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9Byteazar\u53bb\u51b3\u7b56\u6700\u5c11\u8981\u7834\u574f\u591a\u5c11\u5b58\u94b1\u7f50\u3002\n\n##\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\n\n\u5199\u4e00\u6bb5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\n\n\u8bfb\u5165\u5b58\u94b1\u7f50\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u94a5\u5319\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6c42\u51fa\u80fd\u6253\u5f00\u6240\u6709\u5b58\u94b1\u7f50\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7834\u574f\u7684\u5b58\u94b1\u7f50\u7684\u6700\u5c11\u6570\u91cf\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\n",
