    "description": "After trying hard for many years, Byteasar has finally received a pilot license.\n\nTo celebrate the fact, he intends to buy himself an airplane and fly around the planet  3-SATurn (as you may have guessed, this is the planet on which Byteotia is located).\n\nSpecifically, Byteasar plans to fly along the equator.\n\nUnfortunately, the equator is rather long, necessitating refuels.\n\n  The flight range (on full tank) of each aircraft is known.\n\nThere is a number of airports along the equator, and a plane can be refueled when it lands on one.\n\nSince buying an airplane is a big decision, Byteasar asks your help.\n\nHe is about to present you with a list of different plane models he is considering.\n\nNaturally, these differ in their flight range.\n\nFor each plane model, he would like to know the minimum number of landings  (including the final one) he would have to make in order to complete the journey.\n\nNote that for each airplane model, the journey may start at a different airport.\n\n\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u5e74\u7684\u52aa\u529b\uff0cByteasar\u6700\u7ec8\u62ff\u5230\u4e86\u98de\u884c\u5458\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bc1\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e86\u795d\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u4ed6\u6253\u7b97\u4e70\u4e00\u67b6\u98de\u673a\u5e76\u4e14\u7ed5Byteotia\u661f\u7403\u8d64\u9053\u98de\u884c\u4e00\u5708\u3002\u4f46\u4e0d\u5e78\u7684\u662f\u8d64\u9053\u975e\u5e38\u957f\u6240\u4ee5\u9700\u8981\u4e2d\u9014\u52a0\u51e0\u6b21\u6cb9\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u8d64\u9053\u4e0a\u9762\u6240\u6709\u98de\u673a\u573a\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u98de\u673a\u4ece\u98de\u673a\u573a\u8d77\u98de\u964d\u843d\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u6cb9\u3002\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e70\u98de\u673a\u662f\u4e2a\u5341\u5206\u91cd\u5927\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0cByteasar\u51b3\u5b9a\u5bfb\u6c42\u4f60\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002\u4ed6\u5c06\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4f60\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u98de\u884c\u8def\u7ebf\u3002\u81ea\u7136\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98de\u673a\u4e00\u6b21\u80fd\u8d70\u7684\u822a\u7a0b\u662f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6bcf\u6b21\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4ed6\u60f3\u8981\u77e5\u9053\u6700\u5c11\u9700\u8981\u964d\u843d\u591a\u5c11\u6b21\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6b21\uff09\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\u8d77\u70b9\u53ef\u4ee5\u4efb\u610f\u9009\u53d6\u3002\n",
