    "description": "Gremlins have infested the farm. These nasty, ugly fairy-like\n\ncreatures thwart the cows as each one walks from the barn (conveniently located at pasture\\_1) to the other fields, with cow\\_i traveling to from pasture\\_1 to pasture\\_i. Each gremlin is personalized and knows the quickest path that cow\\_i normally takes to pasture\\_i. Gremlin\\_i waits for cow\\_i in the middle of the final cowpath of the quickest route to pasture\\_i, hoping to harass cow\\_i.\n\nEach of the cows, of course, wishes not to be harassed and thus chooses an at least slightly  different route from pasture\\_1 (the barn) to pasture\\_i.\n\nCompute the best time to traverse each of these new not-quite-quickest routes that enable each cow\\_i that avoid gremlin\\_i who is located on the final cowpath of the quickest route from pasture\\_1 to\n\npasture\\_i.\n\nAs usual, the M (2 <= M <= 200,000) cowpaths conveniently numbered 1..M are bidirectional and enable travel to all N (3 <= N <= 100,000) pastures conveniently numbered 1..N. Cowpath i connects pastures a\\_i (1 <= a\\_i <= N) and b\\_i (1 <= b\\_i <= N) and requires t\\_i (1 <= t\\_i <= 1,000) time to traverse. No two cowpaths connect the same two pastures, and no path connects a pasture to itself (a\\_i != b\\_i). Best of all, the shortest path regularly taken by cow\\_i from pasture\\_1 to pasture\\_i is unique in all the test data supplied to your program.\n\nBy way of example, consider these pastures, cowpaths, and [times]:\n\n```cpp\n1--[2]--2-------+ \n|       |       | \n[2]     [1]     [3] \n|       |       | \n+-------3--[4]--4\n```\n``` \nTRAVEL     BEST ROUTE   BEST TIME   LAST PATH \np_1 to p_2       1->2          2         1->2 \np_1 to p_3       1->3          2         1->3 \np_1 to p_4      1->2->4        5         2->4 \n```\nWhen gremlins are present:\n\n```cpp\nTRAVEL     BEST ROUTE   BEST TIME    AVOID \np_1 to p_2     1->3->2         3         1->2 \np_1 to p_3     1->2->3         3         1->3 \np_1 to p_4     1->3->4         6         2->4 \n```\nFor 20% of the test data, N <= 200. \n\nFor 50% of the test data, N <= 3000. \n\nTIME LIMIT: 3 Seconds\n\nMEMORY LIMIT: 64 MB",
