    "description": "The cows have started using cellphones to cowmunicate with each other, but have found that the button layout doesn't suit their hooves very well. They are designing a special cellphone with fewer but larger buttons.\n\n\nOne feature they liked on the standard cellphones was predictive text. Each button has a few letters associated with it, and one types a word by pushing the associated buttons. Because there is more than one letter for each button, this can be ambiguous for some words.  However, most of the time the ambiguity can be resolved by using a dictionary to determine what word the user wanted.\n\n\nSince the cows are designing a custom cellphone, they are also going to replace the English alphabet with the Cow alphabet. By an amazing coincidence, the cow alphabet is simply the first L (1 <= L <= 26) letters of the English alphabet, in the same order. They want to find out how to assign the letters of the Cow alphabet to the B buttons (1 <= B <= L) in such a way that the maximum number of words in their dictionary are unambiguous when entered with predictive text. Like normal cellphones, they want the letters on each button to be a contiguous section (one or more consecutive letters) of the alphabet.\n\n\u5976\u725b\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u90fd\u662f\u7531\u82f1\u6587\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u7684\u524d1(1 < K 26)\u4e2a\u5b57\u6bcd\u6784\u6210\u7684.\u73b0\u5728\u60f3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u624b\u673a\uff0c \u6709\u4e2a\u6309\u952e.\u8bf7\u4f60\u628a\u8fd9L\u4e2a\u5b57\u6bcd\u6309\u987a\u5e8f\u5206\u914d\u7ed9B\u4e2a\u6309\u952e\uff0c\u4f7f\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u6309\u8fd9\u4e9b\u952e\u800c\u552f\u4e00\u786e \u5b9a\u7684\u5976\u725b\u6570\u5c3d\u91cf\u591a.\n",
