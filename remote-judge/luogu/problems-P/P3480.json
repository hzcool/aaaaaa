    "description": "Johny and Margaret are playing \"pebbles\".\n\nInitially there is a certain number of pebbles on a table, grouped in n piles.\n\n The piles are next to each other, forming a single row.\n\n The arrangement of stones satisfies an additional property that each pile consists of at least as many pebbles as the one to the left (with the obvious exception of the leftmost pile).\n\nThe players alternately remove any number of pebbles from a single pile of their choice.\n\nThey have to take care, though, not to make any pile smaller than the one left to it.\n\nIn other words, the piles have to satisfy the initial property after the move as well.\n\nWhen one of the players cannot make a move (i.e. before his move there are no more pebbles on the table), he loses.\n\nJohny always starts, to compensate for Margaret's mastery in this game.\n\nIn fact Margaret is so good that she always makes the best move, and wins the game whenever she has a chance.\n\nTherefore Johny asks your help - he would like to know if he stands a chance of beating Margaret with a particular initial arrangement.\n\nWrite a programme that determines answers to Johny's inquiries.\n\n\u6709N\u5806\u77f3\u5b50\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u5806\u5916\uff0c\u6bcf\u5806\u77f3\u5b50\u4e2a\u6570\u90fd\u4e0d\u5c11\u4e8e\u524d\u4e00\u5806\u7684\u77f3\u5b50\u4e2a\u6570\u3002\u4e24\u4eba\u8f6e\u6d41\u64cd\u4f5c\u6bcf\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u4e00\u5806\u77f3\u5b50\u4e2d\u79fb\u8d70\u4efb\u610f\u591a\u77f3\u5b50\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8981\u4fdd\u8bc1\u64cd\u4f5c\u540e\u4ecd\u7136\u6ee1\u8db3\u521d\u59cb\u65f6\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u8c01\u6ca1\u6709\u77f3\u5b50\u53ef\u79fb\u65f6\u8f93\u6389\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u95ee\u5148\u624b\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u80dc\u3002\n",
