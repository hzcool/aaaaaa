    "description": "King Byteasar faces a serious matter.\n\nTwo competing trade organisations, The Tailors Guild and The Sewers Guild asked,    at the same time, for permissions to open their offices in each town of the kingdom.\n\nThere are ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/gil-en-tex.1.png) towns in Byteotia.\n\nSome of them are connected with bidirectional roads.\n\nEach of the guilds postulate that every town should:\n\nhave an office of the guild, or           be directly connected to another town that does.\n\nThe king, however, suspects foul play. He fears that if there is just a single    town holding the offices of both guilds, it could lead to a clothing cartel.\n\nFor this reason he asks your help.\n\n\n\u7ed9\u4e00\u5f20\u65e0\u5411\u56fe\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u4f60\u7528\u9ed1\u767d\u7070\u7ed9\u70b9\u67d3\u8272\uff0c\u4e14\u6ee1\u8db3\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ed1\u70b9\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u767d\u70b9\u548c\u4ed6\u76f8\u90bb\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u4e00\u4e2a\u767d\u70b9\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ed1\u70b9\u4e0e\u4ed6\u76f8\u90bb\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7070\u70b9\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ed1\u70b9\u548c\u767d\u70b9\u548c\u7070\u70b9\u4e0e\u4ed6\u76f8\u90bb\uff0c\u95ee\u80fd\u5426\u6210\u529f\n",
