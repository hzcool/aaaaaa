    "description": "The cows are building a roller coaster! They want your help to design as fun a roller coaster as possible, while keeping to the budget.\n\nThe roller coaster will be built on a long linear stretch of land of length L (1 \u2264 L \u2264 1,000). The roller coaster comprises a collection of some of the N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 10,000) different interchangable components. Each component i has a fixed length Wi (1 \u2264 Wi \u2264 L). Due to varying terrain, each component i can be only built starting at location Xi (0 \u2264 Xi \u2264 L - Wi). The cows want to string together various roller coaster components starting at 0 and ending at L so that the end of each component (except the last) is the start of the next component.\n\nEach component i has a \"fun rating\" Fi (1 \u2264 Fi \u2264 1,000,000) and a cost Ci (1 \u2264 Ci \u2264 1000). The total fun of the roller coster is the sum of the fun from each component used; the total cost is likewise the sum of the costs of each component used. The cows' total budget is B (1 \u2264 B \u2264 1000). Help the cows determine the most fun roller coaster that they can build with their budget.",
