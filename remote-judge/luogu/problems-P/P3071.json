    "description": "To earn some extra money, the cows have opened a restaurant in their barn specializing in milkshakes.  The restaurant has N seats (1 <= N <= 500,000) in a row. Initially, they are all empty.\n\nThroughout the day, there are M different events that happen in sequence at the restaurant (1 <= M <= 300,000).  The two types of events that can happen are:\n\n1. A party of size p arrives (1 <= p <= N). Bessie wants to seat the party in a contiguous block of p empty seats. If this is possible, she does so in the lowest position possible in the list of seats.  If it is impossible, the party is turned away.\n\n2. A range [a,b] is given (1 <= a <= b <= N), and everybody in that range of seats leaves.\n\nPlease help Bessie count the total number of parties that are turned away over the course of the day.\n\n\u6709\u4e00\u6392n\u4e2a\u5ea7\u4f4d\uff0cm\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002A\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1a\u5c06a\u540d\u5ba2\u4eba\u5b89\u7f6e\u5230\u6700\u5de6\u7684\u8fde\u7eeda\u4e2a\u7a7a\u4f4d\u4e2d\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5219\u4e0d\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002L\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1a[a,b]\u7684\u5ba2\u4eba\u79bb\u5f00\u3002\n\n\u6c42A\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6b21\u6570\u3002\n",
