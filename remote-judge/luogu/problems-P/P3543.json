    "description": "Byteasar has decided to build a house.\n\nHe has chosen a very narrow valley as its location.\n\nBefore Byteasar starts the actual construction work, he has to level the ground first.\n\nHe has two excavators at his disposal: the first one can either increase or decrease the  ground level of any connected area in the valley by exactly ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI19/wyr-en-tex.1.png) meters;  the other can do the same, i.e., either increase or decrease the  ground level of any connected area in the valley, but by exactly ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI19/wyr-en-tex.2.png) meters.\n\nNotice that neither before such an operation nor after it needs the ground in the affected  area be actually leveled.\n\nGiven a map of the area, determine the minimum number of operations required to  level the ground in the whole valley, i.e., to make the ground level everywhere  equal 0.  While the operations are performed, the ground level at any point in  the valley can have arbitrary value; in particular, it may be negative.\n\n\u7ed9\u5b9a $n$ \u4e2a\u6570\u548c $a,b$\u3002\u6bcf\u6b21\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u6bb5\u533a\u95f4 $+a,-a,+b$ \u6216 $-b$\uff0c\u95ee\u6700\u5c11\u64cd\u4f5c\u51e0\u6b21\u80fd\u628a\u5b83\u4eec\u90fd\u53d8\u6210 $0$\u3002\u5982\u679c\u65e0\u89e3\u8bf7\u8f93\u51fa $-1$\u3002\n",
