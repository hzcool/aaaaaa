    "description": "Byteasar lives in Byteburg, a city famous for its milk bars on every corner.\n\nOne day Byteasar came up with an idea of a \"milk multidrink\": he wants to  visit each milk bar for a drink exactly once.\n\nIdeally, Byteasar would like to come up with a route such that the next bar  is always no further than two blocks (precisely: intersections) away from the  previous one.\n\nThe intersections in Byteburg are numbered from ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.1.png) to ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.2.png),  and all the streets are bidirectional.\n\nBetween each pair of intersections there is a unique direct route, ie, one  that does not visit any intersection twice.\n\nByteasar begins at the intersection no. ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.3.png) and finishes at the intersection  no. ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.4.png).\n\nYour task is to find any route that satisfies Byteasar's requirements if such  a route exists.\n\nAn exemplary route satisfying the requirements is: ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.5.png)                There is no route that satisfies the requirements.\n\n\u7ed9\u4e00\u68f5\u6811\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u6b65\u4f10\u5927\u5c0f\u53ea\u80fd\u4e3a1\u62162\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u4e0d\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u904d\u5386n\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u4e14\u8d77\u70b9\u4e3a1\uff0c\u7ec8\u70b9\u4e3an\n",
