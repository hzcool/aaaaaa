    "description": "Gustav is reading about *2-satisfiability*, a well known problem of assigning truth values to boolean\nvariables in order to satisfy a list of *constraints* \u2014 simple logical formulas involving two variables each.\n\nWe are using $n$ variables $x_1, x_2, \\cdots , x_n$ that can take on values $0$ (false) and $1$ (true). A constraint is a\nformula of the form $a\\to b$ where both $a$ and $b$ are possibly negated variables. As usual, $\\to$ denotes\nlogical implication: $a \\to b$ is $0$ only when $a$ is $1$ and $b$ is $0$. The negation of variable $a$ is denoted by $!a$.\n\nGiven an assignment of values to variables, we say that the constraint is *satisfied* if it evaluates to $1$.\nGustav has constructed a list of constraints and correctly concluded that there are *exactly three* different\nassignments of values to variables that satisfy all the constraints. Gustav has wrote down all three\nassignments but has, unfortunately, lost the list of constraints.\nGiven three assignments of $n$ values to variables, find any list consisting of at most $500$ constrains such\nthat the three given assignments are the *only* assignments that satisfy all the constraints.\n\n",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $n (2 \\leq n \\leq 50)$ \u2014 the number of variables. Three lines follow, each\ndescribing one assignment. The $k$-th line contains $n$ space-separated integers $v_1^k,v_2^k,\\cdots,v_n^k$, where each $v_i^k$ is either $0$ or $1$ and denotes the value of the variable $x_i$ in the $k$-th assignment. All three assignments will be different.",
    "outputFormat": "If there is no solution output a single line containing the integer $\u22121$.\nOtherwise, the first line should contain an integer $m$ where $1 \\leq m \\leq 500$ \u2014 the number of constraints\nin your solution. The $k$-th of the following $m$ lines should contain the $k$-th constraint. Each constraint\nshould be a string constructed according to the following rules:\n\n- A *variable* is a string of the form \u201c$\\texttt{x}i$\u201d where $i$ is an integer between $1$ and $n$ inclusive written\n  without leading zeros.\n- A *literal* is a string consisting of a variable possibly preceded by the \u201c$\\texttt{!}$\u201d character.\n- A *constraint* is a string of the form \u201c$a\\texttt{ -> }b$\u201d where both $a$ and $b$ are literals. The implication sign\n  consists of the \u201cminus\u201d character and the \u201cgreater-than\u201d character and there is a single space\n  character both before and after the implication sign.\n\n",
