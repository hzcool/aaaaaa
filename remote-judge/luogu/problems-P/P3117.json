    "description": "The locations of Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 500) are described by distinct points in the 2D plane.  The cows belong to two different breeds: Holsteins and Guernseys.  Farmer John wants to build a rectangular fence with sides parallel to the coordinate axes enclosing only Holsteins, with no Guernseys (a cow counts as enclosed even if it is on the boundary of the fence).  Among all such fences, Farmer John wants to build a fence enclosing the maximum number of Holsteins.  And among all these fences, Farmer John wants to build a fence of minimum possible area.  Please determine this area.  A fence of zero width or height is allowable.\n\n\u7ea6\u7ff0\u7684N(1 <= N <= 500)\u5934\u5976\u725b\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7531\u5750\u6807\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u70b9\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5976\u725b\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u79cd\uff1aHolsteins \u548c Guernseys\u3002\u7ea6\u7ff0\u60f3\u8981\u4fee\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u77e9\u5f62\u7684\u56f4\u680f\uff0c\u56f4\u680f\u7684\u8fb9\u5e73\u884c\u4e8ex\u8f74\u6216\u8005y\u8f74\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8981\u6c42\u56f4\u680f\u4e2d\u53ea\u6709Holsteins\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5976\u725b(\u4e00\u5934\u5976\u725b\u5728\u56f4\u680f\u7684\u8fb9\u8fb9\u4e0a\u4e5f\u7b97\u5728\u56f4\u680f\u4ee5\u5185)\u3002\n\n\u7ea6\u7ff0\u60f3\u8981\u4f7f\u56f4\u680f\u56f4\u4f4f\u8fdb\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u7684Holsteins\u5976\u725b\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5e0c\u671b\u56f4\u680f\u6784\u6210\u7684\u77e9\u5f62\u7684\u9762\u79ef\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u5c0f\uff0c\u8bf7\u4f60\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u9762\u79ef\u3002\n\n\u6ce8\u610f\uff1a\u56f4\u680f\u7684\u957f\u6216\u5bbd\u4e3a0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u662f\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u3002\n",
