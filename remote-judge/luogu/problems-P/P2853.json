    "description": "The cows are having a picnic! Each of Farmer John's K (1 \u2264 K \u2264 100) cows is grazing in one of N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 1,000) pastures, conveniently numbered 1...N. The pastures are connected by M (1 \u2264 M \u2264 10,000) one-way paths (no path connects a pasture to itself).\n\nThe cows want to gather in the same pasture for their picnic, but (because of the one-way paths) some cows may only be able to get to some pastures. Help the cows out by figuring out how many pastures are reachable by all cows, and hence are possible picnic locations.\n\n$K(1 \\le K \\le 100)$ \u53ea\u5976\u725b\u5206\u6563\u5728 $N(1 \\le N \\le 1000)$ \u4e2a\u7267\u573a\uff0e\u73b0\u5728\u5979\u4eec\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u8d77\u6765\u8fdb\u9910\u3002\u7267\u573a\u4e4b\u95f4\u6709 $M(1 \\le M \\le 10000)$ \u6761\u6709\u5411\u8def\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u8d77\u70b9\u548c\u7ec8\u70b9\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6709\u5411\u8def\uff0e\u5979\u4eec\u8fdb\u9910\u7684\u5730\u70b9\u5fc5\u987b\u662f\u6240\u6709\u5976\u725b\u90fd\u53ef\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u3002\u90a3\u4e48\uff0c\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u7267\u573a\u53ef\u4f9b\u8fdb\u98df\u5462\uff1f",
