    "description": "Farmer John has hired a professional photographer to take a picture of some of his cows.  Since FJ's cows represent a variety of different breeds, he would like the photo to contain at least one cow from each distinct breed present in his herd.\n\nFJ's N cows are all standing at various positions along a line, each described by an integer position (i.e., its x coordinate) as well as an integer breed ID.  FJ plans to take a photograph of a contiguous range of cows along the line.  The cost of this photograph is equal its size -- that is, the difference between the maximum and minimum x coordinates of the cows in the range of the photograph.\n\nPlease help FJ by computing the minimum cost of a photograph in which there is at least one cow of each distinct breed appearing in FJ's herd.\n\n\u4f9d\u6b21\u7ed9\u51faN\u5934\u725b\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ca\u79cd\u7c7b\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u627e\u51fa\u8fde\u7eed\u4e00\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u6240\u6709\u79cd\u7c7b\u7684\u725b\uff0c\u95ee\uff1a\u8fd9\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u4e00\u6bb5\u6700\u5c0f\u957f\u5ea6\u662f\u591a\u5c11\uff1f\n",
