    "description": "\n\nIngrid holds a polygon shop in a far away country. She sells only convex polygons with integer coordinates. Her customers prefer polygons that can be cut into two halves in a proper way, that is the cut should be straight  with starting and ending points in the polygon vertices and both halves should be non-empty and have integer areas. The more ways to cut the polygon in the proper way are -- the more expensive the polygon is.\n\nFor example, there are three ways to cut the left polygon in the proper way, and two ways for the right polygon.\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/image_hosting/fei0xc33.png)\n\nThe polygons in the shop are always of excellent quality, so the business is expanding. Now Ingrid needs\u00a0some automatic tool to determine the number of ways to cut the polygon in the proper way. This is very\u00a0important for her shop, since otherwise you will spend a lot of time on setting prices -- just imagine how\u00a0much time would it take to set prices for a medium-sized van with polygons. Could you help Ingrid and\u00a0write the tool for her?\n\n",
