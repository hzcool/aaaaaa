    "description": "By the year 3031, the ICPC has become so popular that a whole new town has to be built to house all the\nWorld Finals teams.\nThe town is beautifully designed, complete with a road network.\nUnfortunately, when preparing the budget, the town planners forgot to take into account the cost of speed-limit signs.\nThey have asked you to help them determine the minimum additional funds they will need.\n\nThe ICPC road network consists of roads, each connecting two intersections. Each road is two-way\nand has already been assigned a speed limit, valid for both directions.\nTo save money, the minimum possible number of roads was used. In other words, there is exactly\none route from any intersection to any other intersection.\n\nThe speed-limit signs need to be installed\nin all places where the speed limit may change for any driver that follows any route.\nMore precisely, if there exists an intersection where at least two roads meet with different speed limits,\nthen *all* of the roads going from that intersection need a speed-limit sign installed at that intersection. \nNote that some roads might need two speed-limit signs, one at each end.\n\nIt costs $c$ dollars to install one speed-limit sign. It is also possible to improve the safety and quality of\nany road so that its speed limit can be increased, which may in turn reduce the number of speed-limit signs required.\nIt costs $x$ dollars to increase the speed limit of one road by $x$ km/h (in both directions).\nTo avoid complaints, the town council does not allow decreasing any of the already-assigned speed limits.\n\nFigure B.1 illustrates the situation given in both Sample Input 1 and Sample Input 2.\n\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/image_hosting/4kx82pq4.png)",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $c$, where $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 20\\,000$) is the number of intersections\nand $c$ ($1 \\le c \\le 10^5$) is the cost of installing one sign.\nEach of the remaining $n-1$ lines contains three integers $u$, $v$, and $s$, where $u$ and $v$ ($1 \\le u, v \\le n; u \\ne v$)\nare the intersections at the ends of a road, and $s$ ($1 \\le s \\le 10^5$) is the current speed limit of that\nroad in kilometers per hour.",
    "outputFormat": "Output the minimum cost to upgrade roads and install speed-limit signs such that the town\nplan satisfies all the rules above.",
