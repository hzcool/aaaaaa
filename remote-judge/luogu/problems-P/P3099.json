    "description": "Cow curling is a popular cold-weather sport played in the Moolympics.\n\nLike regular curling, the sport involves two teams, each of which slides N heavy stones (3 <= N <= 50,000) across a sheet of ice.  At the end of the game, there are 2N stones on the ice, each located at a distinct 2D point.\n\nScoring in the cow version of curling is a bit curious, however.  A stone is said to be \"captured\" if it is contained inside a triangle whose corners are stones owned by the opponent (a stone on the boundary of such a triangle also counts as being captured).  The score for a team is the number of opponent stones that are captured.\n\nPlease help compute the final score of a cow curling match, given the locations of all 2N stones.\n\n\u6709\u4e24\u652f\u961f\u4f0d\u5728\u6bd4\u8d5b\uff0c\u4e00\u961f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e00\u6b21\u53d6\u51fa3\u4e2a\u70b9\u6765\uff0c\u6240\u56f4\u6210\u7684\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u4ee5\u201c\u6355\u83b7\u201d\u5bf9\u65b9\u7684\u70b9\uff0c\u95ee\u4e24\u652f\u961f\u4f0d\u5404\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u83b7\u5bf9\u65b9\u591a\u5c11\u4e2a\u70b9\u3002\n",
