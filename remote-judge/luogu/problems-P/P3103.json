    "description": "FJ's cows have decided to take a vacation, and have miraculously managed to find an airline willing to sell them tickets.  When they arrive at the airport and start boarding their plane, they face an interesting problem, however.\n\nThe airplane has N seats, which we model as the points x=1 through x=N on the number line.  All N cows (1 <= N <= 200,000) are standing in line waiting to get to their seats.  Cow N is at position x=0, Cow N-1 is at position x=-1, and so on.  Cow i has been assigned to Seat S\\_i, where S\\_1,...,S\\_N is a permutation of 1,...,N.\n\nAt each time step, each cow takes a step to the right if she can. When cow i reaches her seat S\\_i, she will stop to put her baggage in the overhead bin, which takes T\\_i seconds, and then sit down. For those T\\_i steps, the cow behind her (if there is one) is blocked from moving forward.  If there is a line of cows behind her, the line is effectively blocked as well.\n\nHow long will it take for all the cows to sit down? \n\nThe sum of T\\_i for all cows will be less than 1,000,000,000. \n\n\u60f3\u8c61\u4e00\u4e0b\u98de\u673a\u6709N\u4e2a\u5ea7\u4f4d\uff0cN\u4e2a\u5ea7\u4f4d\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u6570\u8f74\u4e0a\u76841\u81f3N\u5171N\u4e2a\u6574\u70b9\uff0c\u7b2c1\u4e2a\u5ea7\u4f4d\u5728\u6574\u70b91\u5904\uff0c\u7b2c2\u4e2a\u5ea7\u4f4d\u5728\u6574\u70b92\u5904\uff0c\u2026\u2026\u7b2cN\u4e2a\u5ea7\u4f4d\u5728\u6574\u70b9N\u5904\u3002\n\n\n\u6709N\u4e2a\u5976\u725b\u6392\u597d\u961f\uff0c\u8981\u767b\u9646\u5750\u98de\u673a\uff0c\u7b2cN\u5934\u5976\u725b\u5728\u6570\u8f74\u7684\u6574\u70b90\u5904\uff0c\u7b2cN\u22121\u5934\u5976\u725b\u5728\u6570\u8f74\u7684\u6574\u70b9\u22121\u5904\uff0c\u2026\u2026\u7b2c1\u5934\u5976\u725b\u5728\u6570\u8f74\u7684\u6574\u70b9\u2212N+1\u5904\u3002\u7b2ci\u5934\u5976\u725b\u7684\u5ea7\u4f4d\u53f7\u662fSi\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\uff1a\u6bcf\u5934\u5976\u725b\u90fd\u6709\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5ea7\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u591a\u5934\u5976\u725b\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5ea7\u4f4d\u53f7\u3002\n\n\n\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u79d2\u949f\uff0c\u5976\u725b\u4f1a\u5411\u53f3\u79fb\u52a8\u4e00\u6b65\u5230\u8fbe\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u70b9\uff0c\u524d\u63d0\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u5976\u725b\u6321\u4f4f\u5b83\u3002 \u5f53\u7b2ci\u5934\u5976\u725b\u5230\u8fbe\u5b83\u7684\u5ea7\u4f4dSi\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u9700\u8981\u82b1\u8d39Ti\u79d2\u53bb\u628a\u884c\u674e\u653e\u5230\u5934\u9876\u7684\u884c\u674e\u67b6\u4e0a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5750\u5230\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u98de\u673a\u901a\u9053\u5f88\u7a84\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5728\u7b2ci\u5934\u5976\u725b\u5750\u5230\u81ea\u5df1\u5ea7\u4f4d\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5728\u5b83\u5de6\u8fb9\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5976\u725b\u90fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u52a8\uff0c\u8981\u7b49\u5976\u725bi\u653e\u597d\u884c\u674e\u5750\u597d\u540e\u624d\u80fd\u52a8\u3002\n\n\n\u73b0\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u662f\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u8981\u591a\u5c11\u79d2\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u7684\u5976\u725b\u90fd\u80fd\u505a\u5230\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5ea7\u4f4d\u4e0a\uff1f\n",
