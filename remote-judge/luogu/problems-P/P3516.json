    "outputFormat": "If there is no sequence of moves leading to an arrangement with increasing blocks' numbers, your program should print out \"NIE DA SIE\" (there is no way in Polish), without the quotation marks.\n\nOtherwise there should be a single integer $m$ ($m\\le n^2$), denoting the number of operations, in the first line.\n\nAn operation is a $k$-fold execution of either a or b move.\n\nIf $m>0$, then there should be a sequence of $m$ integers with either a or b appended in the second line.\n\nThus $k$a (for $0<k<n$) denotes the $k$-fold execution of the move a.\n\nAnalogously, $k$b (for $0<k<n$) denotes the $k$-fold execution of the move b.\n\nFurthermore, the characters appended to the numbers in the second line have to alternate.\n\nShould there be more than one solution, your program is free to pick one arbitrarily.\n",
