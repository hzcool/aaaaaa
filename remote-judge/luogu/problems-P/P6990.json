    "description": "\n\nYou are working on a new high-performance database engine -- Instant Compression and Processing Codec $(ICPC).$ ICPC stores user activity records. Each user activity record has an integer user identifier. The records are stored in a number of data files. Each data file is compressed and can contain records from multiple users, however ICPC has to process queries that look for a specific subsets of users. In order to do so, there has to be a way to quickly determine which data files may contain records for a specific user before attempting to decompress them, which may be a long and CPU-consuming process.\n\nICPC uses an algorithm called Bloom Filter. The way it is implemented in ICPC is described below. For each ICPC database the following integer parameters are chosen:\n\n$m$ is the number of bits in the filter;\n\n$f$ is the number of hash functions in the filter;\n\n$a_{i}$ are the parameters for hash functions for $0 \\le i$\n\nA value of the bloom filter is computed for each data file. The data file's bloom filter is a vector of $m$ bits. A bit number $j (0 \\le j < m)$ is set to one if and only if there is a record in this data file for some user identifier $u_{k},$ such that for some hash function $i (0 \\le i < f)$ the following equality holds:\n\n$j = (u_{k} \u00b7 a_{i})$ mod $m$ (1)\n\nYour task is to implement ICPC filtering logic. You are given filter parameters and values for a number of data files and a set of user identifiers. Your task is determine which data files may contain record with at least one user identifier from the specified set. A data file may contain a record with a user identifier $u_{k}$ if and only if for all $i (0 \\le i < f)$ all the bits $j$ given by equality (1) in its filter value are set to one.\n\n",
    "inputFormat": "\n\nThe first line of the input file contains filter parameters -- integer numbers $m , f$ , and $a_{i}$ for $0 \\le i < f (1 \\le m \\le 1000 , 1 \\le f \\le 100 , 1 \\le a_{i} < 2^{31}).$\n\nThe second line of the input file contains an integer $n$ -- the number of data files $(1 \\le n \\le 1000)$ . Each of the following $n$ lines contains bloom filter value of the corresponding file in hexadecimal form. Each value is represented by a string of $\u2308m/4\u2309$ hexadecimal digits (one of $0123456789abcdef).$ The first digit of the string represents bits $0-3$ of the value (stored in order from the least significant bit of a hexadecimal digit to the most significant bit), the second digit -- bits $4-7$ , the third -- $8-11$ , etc. When $m$ mod $4 \u2260 0$ , then the last hexadecimal digit represents the last $m$ mod $4$ bits of the value in its least significant bits.\n\nThe following line of the input file contains an integer $q$ -- the number of user identifiers in a query $(1 \\le q \\le 1000)$ , followed by $q$ integers $u_{k}$ -- the set of distinct user identifiers in the query $(1 \\le u_{k} < 2^{31}).$\n\n",
