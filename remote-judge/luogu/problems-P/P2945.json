    "description": "Farmer John has built a sand castle! Like all good castles, the walls have crennelations, that nifty pattern of embrasures (gaps) and merlons (filled spaces); see the diagram below. The N (1 <= N <= 25,000) merlons of his castle wall are conveniently numbered 1..N; merlon i has height M\\_i (1 <= M\\_i <= 100,000); his merlons often have varying heights, unlike so many.\n\nHe wishes to modify the castle design in the following fashion: he has a list of numbers B\\_1 through B\\_N (1 <= B\\_i <= 100,000), and wants to change the merlon heights to those heights B\\_1, ..., B\\_N in some order (not necessarily the order given or any other order derived from the data).\n\nTo do this, he has hired some bovine craftsmen to raise and lower the merlons' heights. Craftsmen, of course, cost a lot of money. In particular, they charge FJ a total X (1 <= X <= 100) money per unit height added and Y (1 <= Y <= 100) money per unit height\n\nreduced.\n\nFJ would like to know the cheapest possible cost of modifying his sand castle if he picks the best permutation of heights. The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit signed integer.\n\nNote: about 40% of the test data will have N <= 9, and about 60% will have N <= 18.\n\n\u7ea6\u7ff0\u7528\u6c99\u5b50\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u5ea7\u57ce\u5821\uff0e\u6b63\u5982\u6240\u6709\u57ce\u5821\u7684\u57ce\u5899\uff0c\u8fd9\u57ce\u5899\u4e5f\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u67aa\u773c\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u76f8\u90bb\u67aa\u773c\u4e2d\u95f4\u90a3\u90e8\u5206\u53eb\u4f5c\u201c\u57ce\u9f7f\u201d\uff0e    \u57ce\u5899\u4e0a\u4e00\u5171\u6709N(1\u2264N\u226425000)\u4e2a\u57ce\u9f7f\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u90fd\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5ea6Mi.(1\u2264Mi\u2264100000)\uff0e\u73b0\u5728\u7ea6\u7ff0\u60f3\u628a\u57ce\u9f7f\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8c03\u6210\u67d0\u79cd\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0b\u7684Bi\uff0cB2\uff0c\u2026\uff0cBN(1\u2264Bi\u2264100000). -\u4e2a\u57ce\u9f7f\u6bcf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ea6\u7ff0\u9700\u8981X(1\u2264X\u2264100)\u5143\uff1b\u6bcf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ea6\u7ff0\u9700\u8981Y(1\u2264y\u2264100)\u5143\uff0e    \u95ee\u7ea6\u7ff0\u6700\u5c11\u53ef\u7528\u591a\u5c11\u94b1\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u7684\uff0e\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc72^31-1\uff0e\n",
