    "description": "\n\nBella is working in a factory that produces boxes. All boxes are in a shape of rectangular parallelepipeds. A net of the corresponding parallelepiped is cut out of a flat rectangular piece of cardboard of size $w$ *h . This net is a polygon with sides parallel to the sides of the rectangle of the cardboard. The net is bent along several lines and is connected along the edges of the resulting parallelepiped to form a box. The net is bent only along the edges of the resulting box.\n\n![](https://onlinejudgeimages.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/problem/15284/1.png)\n\n![](https://onlinejudgeimages.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/problem/15284/2.png)\n\nThe first example\n\nThe third example\n\nBella is a software developer and her task is to check whether it is possible to make a box of size $a \\times b \\times c$ out of a cardboard of size $w \\times h$ .
