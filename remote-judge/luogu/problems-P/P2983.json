    "description": "Bessie and the herd love chocolate so Farmer John is buying them some.\n\nThe Bovine Chocolate Store features N (1 <= N <= 100,000) kinds of chocolate in essentially unlimited quantities.  Each type i of chocolate has price P\\_i (1 <= P\\_i <= 10^18) per piece and there are C\\_i (1 <= C\\_i <= 10^18) cows that want that type of chocolate.\n\nFarmer John has a budget of B (1 <= B <= 10^18) that he can spend on chocolates for the cows. What is the maximum number of cows that he can satisfy?  All cows only want one type of chocolate, and will be satisfied only by that type.\n\nConsider an example where FJ has 50 to spend on 5 different types of chocolate. A total of eleven cows have various chocolate preferences:\n\nChocolate\\_Type    Per\\_Chocolate\\_Cost    Cows\\_preferring\\_this\\_type 1                   5                      3\n\n2                   1                      1\n\n3                  10                      4\n\n4                   7                      2\n\n5                  60                      1\n\nObviously, FJ can't purchase chocolate type 5, since he doesn't have enough money. Even if it cost only 50, it's a counterproductive purchase since only one cow would be satisfied.\n\nLooking at the chocolates start at the less expensive ones, he can \\* purchase 1 chocolate of type #2 for 1 x  1 leaving 50- 1=49, then \\* purchase 3 chocolate of type #1 for 3 x  5 leaving 49-15=34, then \\* purchase 2 chocolate of type #4 for 2 x  7 leaving 34-14=20, then \\* purchase 2 chocolate of type #3 for 2 x 10 leaving 20-20= 0.\n\nHe would thus satisfy 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 8 cows. \n\n\u8d1d\u897f\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5976\u725b\u4eec\u90fd\u559c\u6b22\u5de7\u514b\u529b\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u7ea6\u7ff0\u51c6\u5907\u4e70\u4e00\u4e9b\u9001\u7ed9\u5979\u4eec\u3002\u5976\u725b\u5de7\u514b\u529b\u4e13\u5356\u5e97\u91cc\n\n\u6709N\u79cd\u5de7\u514b\u529b\uff0c\u6bcf\u79cd\u5de7\u514b\u529b\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u90fd\u662f\u65e0\u9650\u591a\u7684\u3002\u6bcf\u5934\u5976\u725b\u53ea\u559c\u6b22\u4e00\u79cd\u5de7\u514b\u529b\uff0c\u8c03\u67e5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\n\n\u6709Ci\u5934\u5976\u725b\u559c\u6b22\u7b2ci\u79cd\u5de7\u514b\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5de7\u514b\u529b\u7684\u552e\u4ef7\u662fP\u3002\n\n\u7ea6\u7ff0\u624b\u4e0a\u6709B\u5143\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u600e\u6837\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u94b1\u8ba9\u5c3d\u91cf\u591a\u7684\u5976\u725b\u9ad8\u5174\u5462\uff1f\n",
