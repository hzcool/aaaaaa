    "description": "And so it has come - the Triangles have invaded Byteotia!\n\nByteotia lies on an island, occupying its entire surface.\n\nThe shape of the island is a convex polygon(i.e. a polygon whose each inner angle is smaller than $180\\degree$).\n\nA certain number of software factories are located in Byteotia, each of which generates constant gains or losses.\n\nThe Triangles have decided to occupy such a part of Byteotia which:\n\nis a triangle-shaped area, the vertices of which are three different vertices of the polygon-island,     brings the largest income i.e. the sum of all gains and losses generated by factories within the occupied area is maximal.\n\nWe assume that a factory located on the border or in the vertex of occupied area belongs to that area. A territory which contains no factory brings, obviously, a zero income.\n\nByteasar, the King of Byteotia, is concerned by the amount of losses the Triangles' invasion could generate. Help him by writing a programme which shall calculate the sum of gains and losses generated by factories which the Triangles wish to capture.\n\nTaskWrite a programme which:\n\nreads a decription of Byteotia's shape and the locations of factories from the input file,     determines the maximal value of sum of all gains and losses generated by factories within a triangle, whose vertices are three different vertices of the polygon island,     writes the outcome to the output file.\n\n\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e2a\u51f8\u5305\uff0c \u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u51f8\u5305\u5185\u90e8\u6216\u8fb9\u4e0a\u7684\u82e5\u5e72\u4e2a\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8d44\u6e90\u90fd\u6709\u6743\u503c,\u73b0\u5728\u8981\u5728\u51f8\u5305\u4e0a\u9762\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u540c\u76843\u4e2a\u70b9\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f973\u4e2a\u70b9\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\n\n\n\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u6743\u503c\u4e4b\u548c\u6700\u5927\u3002\n\n\n\u51f8\u5305\u70b9\u4e2a\u6570 $n \\le 600$\n\n\n\u8d44\u6e90\u4e2a\u6570 $m \\le 10000$\n",
