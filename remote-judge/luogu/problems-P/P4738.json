    "description": "As you probably know, a tree is a graph consisting of $n$ nodes and $n - 1$ undirected edges in which any two nodes are connected by exactly one path. In a labeled tree each node is labeled with a different integer between $1$ and $n$.\nThe Pr\u00fcfer code of a labeled tree is a unique sequence associated with the tree, generated by repeatedly removing nodes from the tree until only two nodes remain. More precisely, in each step we remove the leaf with the smallest label and append the label of its neighbour to the end of the code. Recall, a leaf is\na node with exactly one neighbour. Therefore, the Pr\u00fcfer code of a labeled tree is an integer sequence of length $n - 2$. It can be shown that the original tree can be easily reconstructed from its Pr\u00fcfer code.\nThe complete binary tree of depth $k$, denoted with $C_k$, is a labeled tree with $2^k - 1$ nodes where node $j$ is connected to nodes $2j$ and $2j + 1$ for all $j < 2^{k-1}$. Denote the Pr\u00fcfer code of $C_k$ with $p_1,p_2,..., p_{2^k-3}$.\nSince the Pr\u00fcfer code of $C_k$ can be quite long, you do not have to print it out. Instead, you need to answer $n$ questions about the sums of certain elements on the code. Each question consists of three integers: $a, d$ and $m$. The answer is the sum of the of the $C_k'$ s Pr\u00fcfer code elements $p_a, p_{a+d},p_{a+2d},...,p_{a+(m-1)d}$.\n",
