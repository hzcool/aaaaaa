    "description": "Inspector Byteasar is investigating a crime that took place on the premises of a software development company.\n\nHe is trying to establish the chain of events.\n\nUnfortunately, the programmers are rather scatterbrained.\n\nStatements of the kind \"Well, when I checked at 14:42,    there were five other programmers logged in on the server.\"    are the most informative of those that Byteasar could get.\n\nIt is known that every programmer came to office at some point    during that day, spent some time in there without going out,    and then left for good, never coming back on the same day.\n\nByteasar, confused by the programmers' statements, is not sure    if he should rely on them.  In fact, he is wondering whether it is at all    possible that they all tell the truth.  He asks you for help in finding    that out.\n\n\u4e00\u5929\u516c\u53f8\u6709n\u4e2a\u5458\u5de5\u548cm\u4e2a\u5458\u5de5\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5458\u5de5\u53ea\u4f1a\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u7ed9\u51fam\u6761\u8bb0\u5f55\u5206\u522b\u662f\u8c01\u5199\u7684\u3001\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u5199\u7684\u4ee5\u53ca\u5199\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u9664\u4e86\u4ed6\u8fd8\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u4eba\u3002\u6c42\u6700\u5927\u7684k\u4f7f\u5f97\u524dk\u6761\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e92\u4e0d\u77db\u76fe\n",

These indicate that the programmer no. $j$ confessed that at time $t$ he was in the office and there were $i$ more programmers apart from him.We assume that the programmers came in to the office and left it at times different from those appearing in the statements, i.e., either before, after or in between them.\n",
