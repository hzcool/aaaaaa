    "description": "This is an interactive problem.\n\nNorth Eastern Emergency Rocket Control agency (NEERC) has developed a new radar control system that is designed to better control ballistic rocket interception. To test the new system NEERC agency had developed a mathematical model that is intended to show this system\u2019s abilities.\n\nLet us represent a rocket as a point on a line. Initially the point is at some unknown integer location between $0$ and $p$, inclusive. It has some unknown speed of $q$ which is an integer between $0$ and $v$, inclusive.\n\nEach second the following happens. First, the control system makes a query to the radar of a form \u201c`check L R`\u201d and gets an answer whether the point is currently between $L$ and $R$, inclusive, or not.\n\nAfter that, the point\u2019s coordinate increases by $q$.\n\nThe goal of the radar control system is to learn the exact location of the point at the beginning of some second. When it does learn the point\u2019s location, then instead of making a query to the radar, it gives a command to intercept the point at that location.\n\nYou have to implement the control system that locates and intercepts the point while making at most $100$ queries to the radar.\n\n### Interaction protocol\nInteraction starts with your program reading two integers \u2014 the values of $p$ and $v$ from the standard input($1\\leq p\\leq 10^5$,$1\\leq v\\leq 10^5$).\n\nAfter that your program must print commands to the standard output. Each command must be one of the following two.\n\n- \u201c`check L R`\u201d \u2014 make a query to the radar to get an answer whether the point is currently between $L$ and $R$, inclusive, or not. The answer must be read from the standard input and is either \u201c`Yes`\u201d or \u201c`No`\u201d. After that the point\u2019s coordinate is increased by $q$. $L$ and $R$ must be integers.\n- \u201c`answer x`\u201d \u2014 the exact coordinate $x$ of the point is known, and you order to intercept the point. After printing this command your program must exit.\n\nYour program must write end-of-line sequence and flush the standard output after each command, including the last command \u201c`answer x`\u201d (end-of-line must be written and flushed before exiting).\n\n",
