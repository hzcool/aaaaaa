    "description": "Byteasar is a famous safe-cracker, who renounced his criminal activity and    got into testing and certifying anti-burglary devices.\n\nHe has just received a new kind of strongbox for tests: a combinatorial safe.\n\nA combinatorial safe is something different from a combination safe,    even though it is opened with a rotary dial.\n\nThe dial can be set in $n$ different positions, numbered from 0 to $n-1$.\n\nSetting the dial in some of these positions opens the safe, while in others it does not.\n\nAnd here is the combinatorial property, from which the name comes from:\n\nif $x$ and $y$ are opening positions, then so is $(x+y)\\ mod\\ n$ too;    note that is holds for $x=y$ as well.\n\nByteasar tried $k$ different positions of the dial: $m_1,m_2,\\cdots,m_k$.\n\nThe positions $m_1,m_2,\\cdots,m_{k-1}$ did not open the safe,only the last position $m_k$ did.\n\nByteasar is already tired from checking these $k$ positions and has thus    absolutely no intention of trying the remaining ones.\n\nHe would like to know however, based on what he already knows about the    positions he tried, what is the maximum possible number of positions that    open the safe.\n\nHelp him by writing an appropriate program!\n\n\u7ed9\u5b9an\u548ck\u4e2a\u6574\u6570\uff0c\u6c42mod n\u52a0\u6cd5\u4e0b\u7684\u7fa4G\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b50\u7fa4G'\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3a[1]~a[k-1]\u90fd\u4e0d\u5728\u7fa4\u4e2d\u800ca[k]\u5728\u7fa4\u4e2d\n",
