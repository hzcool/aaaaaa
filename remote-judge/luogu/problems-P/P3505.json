    "description": "King Byteasar is the ruler of the whole solar system that contains ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/tel-en-tex.1.png) planets.\n\nThis number is so large that people have abandoned the silly custom of naming the planets    and use numbers instead. The planets are thus conveniently numbered from 1 to ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/tel-en-tex.2.png).\n\nByteasar's palace is on the planet no. 1, while his military base on the planet no. 2.\n\nA long time ago Byteasar had a teleportation portal established between these two planets,    which allows travelling from either planet to another in two hundred and fifty minutes    (slightly over four hours).\n\nNowadays the teleportation technology is more mature, and the recent teleportation devices shorten    the travel time to just a single hour. Let us note here, that all the portals, both the Byteasar's old one    and the new ones available on the market, are of course bidirectional, and that the teleportation    travel time is irrespective of the distance travelled.\n\nSome planets of the system are already connected with these new teleportation portals.\n\nIn fact, it is already possible to travel between the planets no. 1 and 2 without using the king's private portal,    though this involves several other portals and is thus no faster than the king's portal.\n\nByteasar finds this rather fortunate, as he believes that such possibility would be a security breach.\n\nThe technology itself is increasingly available, and as everyone realises its economic significance,    each pair of planets that are not currently directly connected with a portal are petitioning for establishing    such a connection. Being a wise ruler, Byteasar intends to give his consent to as many constructions as possible,    though keeping himself secure, i.e., not allowing the travel between planets 1 and 2 faster than with his private portal.\n\nHelp the king determine how many portals he can agree to.\n\n\u7ed9\u4e00\u5f20\u56fe\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u4f60\u518d\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u591a\u8fde\u8fb9\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u4ece1\u52302\u81f3\u5c11\u8981\u7ecf\u8fc75\u6761\u8fb9\n",
