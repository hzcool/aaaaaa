    "description": "A large shipment of doodads has just arrived, and each doodad has a suggested retail price of $b$ cents. You've noticed that consumers are much more likely to purchase goods when most of the trailing digits are the same. For example, items are more likely to be priced at $99$ cents rather than $57$ cents. So to make your goods more appealing, you've decided to sell your goods in bundles. To make a bundle, you choose a positive integer $k$, and sell $k$ doodads for $k \\times b$ cents. With an appropriate choice of $k$ you can have a more pleasing price. For example, selling $57$-cent doodads in bundles of size $7$ means that each bundle sells for $399$ cents, which has two trailing $9$s, rather than no trailing $9$s of $57$. This idea of trailing $9$s can be generalized to any other trailing digit: bundles of $692$ $57$-cent doodads sell for $39\\,444$ cents (three trailing $4$s) and bundles of one million doodads sell for $57\\,000\\,000$ cents (six trailing $0$s).\n\nAfter a little thought, you realize that you do not want to make your bundles too large---not only can the price be excessive, but who really needs several million doodads? For any type of doodad, your marketing department has a maximum bundle price of $a$.\n\nGiven the price of a doodad, the desired trailing digit, and the maximum price of a bundle, write a program that optimizes the trailing digits.",
    "inputFormat": "Input consists of a single line containing three integers $b$, $d$, and $a$, where $b$ ($1 \\leq b < 10^{6}$) is the price of a doodad in cents, $d$ ($0 \\leq d \\leq 9$) is the desired trailing digit, and $a$ ($b \\leq a < 10^{10\\,000}$) is the maximum price of a bundle.",
    "outputFormat": "Output the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of $d$ that can appear at the end of a bundle price, given that the price of the bundle cannot exceed $a$.",
