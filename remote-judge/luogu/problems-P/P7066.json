    "description": "\n\nGerard develops a Halloween computer game. The game is played on a rectangular graveyard with a rectangular chapel in it. During the game, the player places new rectangular graves on the graveyard. The grave should completely fit inside graveyard territory and should not overlap with the chapel. The grave may touch borders of the graveyard or the chapel.\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/image_hosting/qktc13ls.png)\n\nGerard asked you to write a program that determines whether it is possible to place a new grave of given size or there is no enough space for it.\n\n",

The second line also contains two pairs of integers $x_{3}, y_{3}, x_{4}, y_{4} (x_{1} < x_{3} < x_{4} < x_{2}; y_{1} < y_{3} < y_{4} < y_{2})$ \u2014 coordinates of bottom left and top right corners of the chapel.\n\nThe third line contains two integers $w , h$ \u2014 width and height of the new grave $(1 \\le w , h \\le 10^{9}).$ Side with length $w$ should be placed along OX axis, side with length $h$ \u2014 along OY axis.\n\n",
