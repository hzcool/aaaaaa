    "description": "In 1921, the amateur archaeologist Alfred Watkins coined the term\n\"ley lines\" to refer to straight lines between numerous places of\ngeographical and historical interest. These lines have often been\nassociated with mysterious and mystical theories, many of which still\npersist.\n\nOne of the common criticisms of ley lines is that lines one draws on a\nmap are actually of non-zero width, and finding \"lines\" that connect\nmultiple places is trivial, given a sufficient density of points and a\nsufficiently thick pencil. In this problem you will explore that\ncriticism.\n\nFor simplicity, we will ignore the curvature of the earth, and just assume\nwe are dealing with a set of points on a plane, each of which has a\nunique $(x, y)$ coordinate, and no three of which lie on a single\nstraight line. Given such a set, and the thickness of your pencil,\nwhat is the largest number of points through which you can draw a\nsingle line?",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input consists of two integers $n$ and $t$, where\n$n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 3\\,000$) is the number of points in the set\nand $t$ ($0 \\le t \\le 10^9$) is the thickness of the pencil.\nThen follow $n$ lines,\neach containing two integers $x$ and $y$ ($-10^9 \\le x, y \\le 10^9$),\nindicating the coordinates of a point in the set.\n\nYou may assume that the input is such that the answer would not change\nif the thickness $t$ was increased or decreased by $10^{-2}$, and that no\nthree input points are collinear.",
    "outputFormat": "Output the maximum number of points that lie on a single \"line\" of\nthickness $t$.",
