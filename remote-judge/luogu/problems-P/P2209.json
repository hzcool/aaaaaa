    "description": "Farmer John has decided to take a cross-country vacation. Not wanting his cows to feel left out, however, he has decided to rent a large truck and to bring the cows with him as well!\n\nThe truck has a large tank that can hold up to G units of fuel (1 <= G <= 1,000,000).  Unfortunately, it gets very poor mileage: it consumes one unit of fuel for every unit of distance traveled, and FJ has a total of D units of distance to travel along his route (1 <= D <= 1,000,000,000).\n\nSince FJ knows he will probably need to stop to refill his tank several times along his trip, he makes a list of all the N fuel stations along his route (1 <= N <= 50,000).  For each station i, he records its distance X\\_i from the start of the route (0 <= X\\_i <= D), as well as the price Y\\_i per unit of fuel it sells (1 <= Y\\_i <= 1,000,000).\n\nGiven this information, and the fact that FJ starts his journey with exactly B units of fuel (0 <= B <= D), please determine the minimum amount of money FJ will need to pay for fuel in order to reach his destination. If it is impossible for him to reach the destination, please output -1. Note that the answer to this problem may not fit into a standard 32-bit integer.\n\n\nFarmer John \u51b3\u5b9a\u53bb\u4e00\u6b21\u8de8\u56fd\u65c5\u6e38\u5ea6\u5047\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e0d\u8ba9\u4ed6\u7684\u5976\u725b\u4eec\u611f\u5230\u88ab\u629b\u5f03\uff0c\u4ed6\u51b3\u5b9a\u79df\u4e00\u8f86\u5927\u5361\u8f66\u6765\u5e26\u4ed6\u7684\u5976\u725b\u4eec\u4e00\u8d77\u65c5\u884c\u3002\n\n\n\u8fd9\u8f86\u5361\u8f66\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u6cb9\u7bb1\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u88c5\u4e0b $G$ \u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d\u7684\u6cb9\uff08$1 \\le G \\le {10}^6$\uff09\uff0c\u4e0d\u5e78\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5361\u8f66\u7684\u8017\u6cb9\u91cf\u4e5f\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u5361\u8f66\u6bcf\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5c31\u8981\u6d88\u8017\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d\u7684\u6cb9\u3002Farmer John \u8981\u5728\u4ed6\u7684\u65c5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8d70 $D$ \u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\uff08$1 \\le D \\le {10}^9$\uff09\n\n\n\u56e0\u4e3a FJ \u76f4\u5230\u4ed6\u53ef\u80fd\u8981\u51e0\u6b21\u5728\u65c5\u9014\u4e2d\u505c\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ed9\u6cb9\u7bb1\u52a0\u6cb9\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4ed6\u628a\u5728\u65c5\u9014\u6cbf\u8def\u4e0a\u7684 $N$ \u4e2a\u52a0\u6cb9\u7ad9\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55\u505a\u6210\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7b2c $i$ \u4e2a\u52a0\u6cb9\u7ad9\uff0c\u4ed6\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e86\u52a0\u6cb9\u7ad9\u4e0e\u8d77\u70b9\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb $X_i$\uff08$0 \\le X_i \\le D$\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a0\u6cb9\u7ad9\u4e2d\u6bcf\u5355\u4f4d\u6cb9\u7684\u4ef7\u683c $Y_i$\uff08$1 \\le Y_i \\le {10}^6$\uff09\u3002\n\n\u5df2\u77e5\u4ee5\u4e0a\u6240\u7ed9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca FJ \u5728\u8def\u9014\u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\u62e5\u6709\u7684\u71c3\u6cb9\u7684\u6570\u91cf $B$\uff08$0 \\le B \\le D$\uff09\uff0c\u8bf7\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa FJ \u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u65f6\u82b1\u8d39\u7684\u6cb9\u8d39\u7528\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3002\u5982\u679c FJ \u65e0\u6cd5\u5230\u8fbe\u65c5\u9014\u7684\u7ec8\u70b9\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8bf7\u8f93\u51fa `-1`\u3002\u672c\u9898\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528 32 \u4f4d\u6574\u6570\u50a8\u5b58\u3002\n",
