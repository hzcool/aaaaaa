    "description": "The council of your home town has decided to improve road sign placement,especially for dead ends. They have given you a road map, and you must determine where to put up signs to mark the dead ends. They want you to use as few signs as possible.\n\nThe road map is a collection of locations connected by two-way streets. The following rule describes how to obtain a complete placement of dead-end signs. Consider a street $S$ connecting a location $x$ with another location. The $x$-entrance of $S$ gets a dead-end sign if, after entering $S$ from $x$, it is not possible to come back to $x$ without making a U-turn. A U-turn is a 180-degree turn immediately reversing the direction.\n\nTo save costs, you have decided not to install redundant dead-end signs, as specified by the following rule. Consider a street $S$ with a dead-end sign at its $x$-entrance and another street $T$ with a dead-end sign at its $y$-entrance. If, after entering $S$ from $x$, it is possible to go to $y$ and enter $T$ without making a U-turn, the dead-end sign at the $y$-entrance of $T$ is redundant. See Figure E.1 for examples.\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/image_hosting/33rn5okp.png)\n\nFigure E.1: Illustration of sample inputs, indicating where non-redundant dead-end signs are placed.\n",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $m$, where $n$ $(1 \\leq n \\leq 5\\times10^5)$ is the number of locations and $m$ $(0 \\leq m \\leq 5 \\times 10^5)$ is the number of streets. Each of the following $m$ lines contains two integers $v$ and $w$ $(1 \\leq v \\lt w \\leq n)$ indicating that there is a two-way street connecting locations $v$ and $w$. All location pairs in the input are distinct.",
    "outputFormat": "On the first line, output $k$, the number of dead-end signs installed. On each of the next $k$ lines, output two integers $v$ and $w$ marking that a dead-end sign should be installed at the $v$-entrance of a street connecting locations $v$ and $w$. The lines describing dead-end signs must be sorted in ascending order of $v$-locations,breaking ties in ascending order of $w$-locations.",
