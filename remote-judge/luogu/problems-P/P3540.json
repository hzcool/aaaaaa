    "description": "A famous Byteotian physicist Byteasar is studying a new constituent of matter - squarks.\n\nThese are quite exotic particles that never exist alone but always in pairs.\n\nMoreover, squarks of a particular kind form pairs only with squarks of different kinds.\n\nAfter years of studies Byteasar has established that there are ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI19/squ-en-tex.1.png) different kinds of squarks.\n\nSquarks of each kind have a unique mass, which is a positive integer multiple of (an appropriate) unit.\n\nByteasar has also measured the total mass of each of the ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI19/squ-en-tex.2.png) possible pairs of squarks.\n\nAccording to standard Byteotian model of physics, the mass of a pair of squarks equals the sum of the masses    of the two squarks forming it.\n\nNow Byteasar desires to determine the individual masses of squarks of every kind.\n\nHe has asked your help in writing a program that will determine all solutions to this puzzle,    i.e., will reconstruct all configurations of squark masses that are consistent with his previous measurements.\n\n\u8bbe\u6709n\u4e2a\u4e92\u4e0d\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6b63\u6574\u6570{X1,X2,\u2026Xn}\uff0c\u4efb\u53d6\u4e24\u4e2aXi,Xj(i\u2260j)\uff0c\u80fd\u7b97\u51faXi+Xj\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u6240\u6709\u53d6\u6cd5\u5171n\\*(n-1)/2\u4e2a\u548c\uff0c\u8981\u4f60\u6c42\u51faX1,X2,\u2026Xn\u3002\n\n3<=n<=300, \u6bcf\u4e2a\u6b63\u6574\u6570\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc710^8\n",
