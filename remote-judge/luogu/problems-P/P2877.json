    "description": "Bessy is going to school and doing well. She has taken N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 5000 -- except one case where 1 \u2264 N \u2264 50,000) tests and recorded the scores (Ti points out of Pi points for test i; 0 \u2264 Ti \u2264 Pi < 40,000; 0 < Pi) as this task's input.\n\nHer teacher will drop the D tests with the lowest percentage (Ti\u2044Pi) before calculating Bessie's final grade (which is the sum of the remaining test score points over the sum of the remaining total test points). Bessy is good at math and quickly realizes that this does not benefit her as much as it might.\n\nTo prove her point, Bessy wants to find all values of D for which she could have ended up with a higher grade by choosing to drop different tests than the teacher would have. Help her by finding and printing all values of D for which this is possible.\n\nBessy has noted that, amazingly, she has never scored the same percentage on two different tests.\n\n\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u53c2\u52a0\u4e86N\u573a\u8003\u8bd5\uff0c\u7b2ci\u573a\u6ee1\u5206\u4e3aP[i]\uff0c\u5176\u5f97\u5206\u4e3aT[i]\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u8981\u5220\u53bb\u5176\u4e2dD\u6b21\u8003\u8bd5\u7684\u6210\u7ee9\uff0c\u7528\u5269\u4e0b\u7684\u603b\u5f97\u5206\u9664\u4ee5\u5269\u4e0b\u7684\u6ee1\u5206\u4e4b\u548c\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u6700\u7ec8\u6210\u7ee9\u3002\u95ee\u5bf9\u4e8e\u54ea\u4e9bD\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5220\u9664\u5f97\u5206\u6bd4(\u5373T[i]/P[i])\u6700\u5c0f\u7684D\u573a\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u6210\u7ee9\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684(\u7528\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u6210\u7ee9)\u3002\n",
