FJ would like to take a photo of a contiguous group of cows but, due to a traumatic  childhood incident involving the numbers $1 \\ldots 6$, he only wants to take a picture of a group of cows if their IDs add up to a multiple of 7.\n\n\nPlease help FJ determine the size of the largest group he can photograph.\n\n\u7ed9\u4f60n\u4e2a\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u662fa[1],a[2],...,a[n]\u3002\u6c42\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u957f\u7684\u533a\u95f4[x,y]\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u533a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6570(a[x],a[x+1],a[x+2],...,a[y-1],a[y])\u7684\u548c\u80fd\u88ab7\u6574\u9664\u3002\u8f93\u51fa\u533a\u95f4\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u82e5\u6ca1\u6709\u7b26\u5408\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa0\u3002\n\n",
