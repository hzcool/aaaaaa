    "description": "Farmer John owns 3\\*N (1 <= N <= 500,000) cows surprisingly numbered 0..3\\*N-1, each of which has some associated integer weight W\\_i (1 <= W\\_i <= d). He is entering the Grand Farm-off, a farming competition where he shows off his cows to the greater agricultural community.\n\nThis competition allows him to enter a group of N cows. He has given each of his cows a utility rating U\\_i (1 <= U\\_i <= h), which\n\nrepresents the usefulness he thinks that a particular cow will have in the competition, and he wants his selection of cows to have the maximal sum of utility.\n\nThere might be multiple sets of N cows that attain the maximum utility sum. FJ is afraid the competition may impose a total weight limit on the cows in the competition, so a secondary priority is to bring lighter weight competition cows.\n\nHelp FJ find a set of N cows with minimum possible total weight among the sets of N cows that maximize the utility, and print the remainder when this total weight is divided by M (10,000,000 <= M <= 1,000,000,000).\n\nNote: to make the input phase faster, FJ has derived polynomials which will generate the weights and utility values for each cow. For each cow 0 <= i < 3\\*N,\n\n $$W_i=(a\\times i^5+b\\times i^2+c)\\mod d$$\n \n $$U_i=(e\\times i^5+f\\times i^3+g)\\mod h$$\n \n $$(0\\le a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h\\le 10^9)$$\n\nThe formulae do sometimes generate duplicate numbers; your algorithm should handle this properly. \n\n\u519c\u592b\u7ea6\u7ff0\u67093N(1 < N < 500000)\u5934\u725b\uff0c\u7f16\u53f7\u4f9d\u6b21\u4e3a1..#N\uff0c\u6bcf\u5934\u725b\u90fd\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u6570\u503c\u7684\u4f53 \u91cd\u3002\u7ea6\u7ff0\u51c6\u5907\u53c2\u52a0\u519c\u573a\u6280\u827a\u5927\u8d5b\uff0c\u5411\u5e7f\u5927\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u793e\u533a\u5c55\u793a\u4ed6\u7684\u5976\u725b.\n\u5927\u8d5b\u89c4\u5219\u5141\u8bb8\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5e26N\u5934\u725b\u53c2\u8d5b.\u7ea6\u7ff0\u7ed9\u6bcf\u5934\u725b\u8d4b\u4e88\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u6709\u7528\u5ea6\u201dUi\uff0c\u5b83\u8868 \u793a\u4e86\u67d0\u5934\u725b\u5728\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u7528\u7a0b\u5ea6.\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5e0c\u671b\u4ed6\u9009\u51fa\u7684\u5976\u725b\u7684\u6709\u7528\u5ea6\u4e4b\u548c\u6700\u5927.\n\n\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u9009\u51fa\u5f88\u591a\u7ec4\u7684N\u5934\u725b\u90fd\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6709\u7528\u5ea6\u6700\u5927\u548c.\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5bb3\u6015\u9009\u51fa\u7684N\u5934\u725b\u7684\u603b\u91cd\u91cf\u4f1a\u7ed9\u5927\u8d5b \u5e26\u6765\u9707\u64bc\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u8981\u8003\u8651\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u4f53\u91cd\u8f7b\u7684\u5976\u725b.\n\n\u5e2e\u52a9\u7ea6\u7ff0\u9009\u51faN\u5934\u603b\u91cd\u91cf\u6700\u8f7b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u7528\u5ea6\u4e4b\u548c\u6700\u5927\u7684\u5976\u725b.\u8f93\u51fa\u4f53\u91cd\u6a21M\u540e\u7684\u4f59\u6570.\n\n\u6ce8\u610f\uff1a\u4e3a\u4e86\u4f7f\u8f93\u5165\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u7ea6\u7ff0\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6765\u751f\u6210\u6bcf\u5934\u725b\u7684\u4f53\u91cd\u548c\u6709\u7528\u5ea6.\u5bf9\u6bcf\u5934\u725b/\uff0c \u4f53\u91cd\u548c\u6709\u7528\u5ea6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u516c\u5f0f\u4e3a\uff1a\n\n\n\n $$W_i=(a\\times i^5+b\\times i^2+c)\\mod d$$\n \n $$U_i=(e\\times i^5+f\\times i^3+g)\\mod h$$\n \n $$(0\\le a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h\\le 10^9)$$",
