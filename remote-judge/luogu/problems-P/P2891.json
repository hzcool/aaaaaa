    "description": "Cows are such finicky eaters. Each cow has a preference for certain foods and drinks, and she will consume no others.\n\nFarmer John has cooked fabulous meals for his cows, but he forgot to check his menu against their preferences. Although he might not be able to stuff everybody, he wants to give a complete meal of both food and drink to as many cows as possible.\n\nFarmer John has cooked F (1 \u2264 F \u2264 100) types of foods and prepared D (1 \u2264 D \u2264 100) types of drinks. Each of his N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 100) cows has decided whether she is willing to eat a particular food or drink a particular drink. Farmer John must assign a food type and a drink type to each cow to maximize the number of cows who get both.\n\nEach dish or drink can only be consumed by one cow (i.e., once food type 2 is assigned to a cow, no other cow can be assigned food type 2).\n\n\u6709F\u79cd\u98df\u7269\u548cD\u79cd\u996e\u6599\uff0c\u6bcf\u79cd\u98df\u7269\u6216\u996e\u6599\u53ea\u80fd\u4f9b\u4e00\u5934\u725b\u4eab\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u6bcf\u5934\u725b\u53ea\u4eab\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u98df\u7269\u548c\u4e00\u79cd\u996e\u6599\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u6709n\u5934\u725b\uff0c\u6bcf\u5934\u725b\u90fd\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u98df\u7269\u79cd\u7c7b\u5217\u8868\u548c\u996e\u6599\u79cd\u7c7b\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u95ee\u6700\u591a\u80fd\u4f7f\u51e0\u5934\u725b\u540c\u65f6\u4eab\u7528\u5230\u81ea\u5df1\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u98df\u7269\u548c\u996e\u6599\u3002\uff081 <= f <= 100, 1 <= d <= 100, 1 <= n <= 100\uff09\n",
