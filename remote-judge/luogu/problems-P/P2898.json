    "description": "The cows, who always have an inferiority complex about their intelligence, have a new guessing game to sharpen their brains.\n\nA designated 'Hay Cow' hides behind the barn and creates N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 1,000,000) uniquely-sized stacks (conveniently numbered 1..N) of hay bales, each with 1..1,000,000,000 bales of hay.\n\nThe other cows then ask the Hay Cow a series of Q (1 \u2264 Q \u2264 25,000) questions about the the stacks, all having the same form:\n\nWhat is the smallest number of bales of any stack in the range of stack numbers Ql..Qh (1 \u2264 Ql \u2264 N; Ql \u2264 Qh \u2264 N)?The Hay Cow answers each of these queries with a single integer A whose truthfulness is not guaranteed.\n\nHelp the other cows determine if the answers given by the Hay Cow are self-consistent or if certain answers contradict others.\n\n",
    "inputFormat": "\\* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and Q\n\n\\* Lines 2..Q+1: Each line contains three space-separated integers that represent a single query and its reply: Ql, Qh, and A\n",
    "outputFormat": "\\* Line 1: Print the single integer 0 if there are no inconsistencies among the replies (i.e., if there exists a valid realization of the hay stacks that agrees with all Q queries). Otherwise, print the index from 1..Q of the earliest query whose answer is inconsistent with the answers to the queries before it.\n",
