    "description": "Bessie is out at the movies.  Being mischievous as always, she has decided to hide from Farmer John for L (1 <= L <= 100,000,000) minutes, during which time she wants to watch movies continuously. She has N (1 <= N <= 20) movies to choose from, each of which has a certain duration and a set of showtimes during the day.  Bessie may enter and exit a movie at any time during one if its showtimes, but she does not want to ever visit the same movie twice, and she cannot switch to another showtime of the same movie that overlaps the current showtime.\n\nHelp Bessie by determining if it is possible for her to achieve her goal of watching movies continuously from time 0 through time L.  If it is, determine the minimum number of movies she needs to see to achieve this goal (Bessie gets confused with plot lines if she watches too many movies).\n\n\u5976\u725b\u8d1d\u897f\u60f3\u8fde\u7eed\u770bL (1 <= L <= 100,000,000)\u5206\u949f\u7684\u7535\u5f71\uff0c\u6709 N (1 <= N <= 20)\u90e8\u7535\u5f71\u53ef\u4f9b\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6bcf\u90e8\u7535\u5f71\u4f1a\u5728\u4e00\u5929\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u6bb5\u653e\u6620\u3002\n\n\n\u8d1d\u897f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e00\u90e8\u7535\u5f71\u64ad\u653e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u5165\u6216\u9000\u51fa\u653e\u6620\u5385\u3002\u4f46\u5979\u4e0d\u613f\u610f\u91cd\u590d\u770b\u5230\u4e00\u90e8\u7535\u5f71\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6bcf\u90e8\u7535\u5f71\u5979\u6700\u591a\u770b\u5230\u4e00\u6b21\u3002\u5979\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u5728\u770b\u4e00\u90e8\u7535\u5f71\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6362\u5230\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u5728\u64ad\u653e\u76f8\u540c\u7535\u5f71\u7684\u653e\u6620\u5385\u3002\n\n\n\u8bf7\u5e2e\u8d1d\u897f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5979\u80fd\u591f\u505a\u5230\u4ece0\u5230L\u5206\u949f\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0d\u65ad\u5730\u89c2\u770b\u7535\u5f71\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u80fd\uff0c\u8bf7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5979\u6700\u5c11\u770b\u51e0\u90e8\u7535\u5f71\u5c31\u884c\u4e86\u3002\n",
