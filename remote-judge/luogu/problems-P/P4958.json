    "description": "Little Mate got an array of lowercase letters from the English alphabet as a present from his\nparents. In order to have at least some use of such a clever present, he decided to use it for\nfinding rhymes when writing his next song.\n\nTo find a specific rhyme, Mate wants to select a word of length D that ends with an array of\ncharacters XY, i.e. where the next to last letter is X, and the last Y. Mate\u2019s process of\nselecting a word is by first crossing out some letters in a given sequence, and then merging\nthe letters he didn\u2019t cross out into a single word. He wants to know in how many different\nways he can cross out the letters so that he meets the given conditions.\n\nThe selection of two words is considered distinct if the sets of positions of the crossed-out\nletters are different.\n",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains an array of lowercase letters of the English alphabet S (2 \u2264 |S|\n\u2264 2000).\n\nThe second line of input contains the integer Q (1 \u2264 Q \u2264 500 000), the number of different\nrhymes for which Mate needs to select words.\n\nEach of the following Q lines contains the integer D (2 \u2264 D \u2264 |S|) and an array of lowercase\nletters of the English alphabet XY from the task.",
    "outputFormat": "The $i^{th}$ out of Q lines must contain the required number of ways for the $i^{th}$ rhyme. Since that number can be quite large, output only the value **modulo 1 000 000 007\u200b**.",
