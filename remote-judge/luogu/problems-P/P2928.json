    "description": "Canmuu is out for revenge after being utterly defeated by Bessie in paintball and has challenged Bessie to a video game.\n\nIn this game, Bessie starts out at point (BX, BY) in the coordinate grid (-1,000 <= BX <= 1,000; -1000 <= BY <= 1,000), and tries to escape, starting at time 0. She moves continuously at a velocity of (BVX, BVY) units/second (-100 <= BVX <= 100; -100 <= BVY <= 100). Thus, at time 1 she will be at point (BX + BVX, BY + BVY); at time 1.5 she will be at (BX + 1.5\\*BVX, BY + 1.5\\*BVY).\n\nUnfortunately, Canmuu has sent N (1 <= N <= 50,000) cattle bruisers to pursue Bessie.  At time t=0, cattle bruiser i is at position (X\\_i, Y\\_i) (-1,000 <= X\\_i <= 1,000; -1,000 <= Y\\_i <= 1,000) with velocity (VX\\_i, VY\\_i) units/second (-1,000 <= VX\\_i <= 1,000; -1,000 <= VY\\_i <= 1,000).\n\nEach cattle bruiser carries a 'proximity' weapon to fire at Bessie; the weapon can hurt Bessie when the cattle bruiser is no further than R (1 <= R <= 2,500) units from her.\n\nBessie has a shield to protect herself from these attacks. However, she does not want to waste any of her shield's power, so she would like to know the maximum number of cattle bruisers within firing range for any (potentially non-integer) time t >= 0.\n\nIn order to avoid precision errors with real numbers, it is guaranteed that the answer produced will be the same whether the attack range is decreased to R-0.0001 or increased to R+0.0001.\n\nFEEDBACK: Your first 50  submissions for this problem will be run on some of the official test data, and you will receive a summary of the results.\n\n\u81ea\u4ece\u5361\u95e8\u5728\u5f39\u73e0\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u88ab\u8d1d\u831c\u5f7b\u5e95\u51fb\u8d25\uff0c\u4ed6\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u60f3\u627e\u673a\u4f1a\u590d\u4ec7.\u8fd9\u4f1a\u513f\uff0c\u4ed6\u9080\u8d1d\u831c\u53bb\u73a9\u4e00 \u4e2a\u7535\u8111\u6e38\u620f.\n\n\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d1d\u831c\u5728\uff08BX,BY\uff09\u5904\u5f00\u59cb\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd9\u65f6\u65f6\u523b\u4e3a0.\u5979\u8981\u8bd5\u56fe \u9003\u79bb.\u5979\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a(BVX\uff0cBVY)\u6bcf\u79d2.\n\n\u4e0d\u5e78\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5361\u95e8\u4e3a\u4e86\u590d\u4ec7\uff0c\u653e\u51faN(l<=N< =50000)\u4e2a\u6740\u624b\u8ffd\u51fb\u8d1d\u831c.\u5728t = 0\u65f6\uff0c\u6740\u624bi\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e \u662fXi, Yi\u4ed6\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u662fVxi,Vyi\u6bcf\u79d2.\n\n\u7531\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6740\u624b\u914d\u5907\u4e86\u624b\u67aa\uff0c\u624b\u67aa\u7684\u5c04\u7a0b\u662fR\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\u8d1d\u831c\u8981\u4e0e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6740\u624b\u7684\u8ddd \u79bb\u4fdd\u6301\u8d85\u8fc7R\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u6709\u6027\u547d\u4e4b\u865e.\n\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8d1d\u831c\u8fd8\u6709\u4e00\u4ef6\u79d8\u5bc6\u6b66\u5668\uff0c\u76fe.\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5979\u4e0d\u60f3\u8fc7\u591a\u5730\u6d88\u8017\u76fe\u7684\u80fd\u91cf.\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u5979\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u5728 \u9003\u8131\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u67d0\u4e00\u4e2a\u65f6\u523b\u5979\u5728\u6700\u591a\u4e3a\u591a\u5c11\u4e2a\u6740\u624b\u7684\u5c04\u7a0b\u5185.\u5f53\u7136\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65f6\u523b\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u662f\u6574\u6570.\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u9632\u6b62\u51fa\u73b0\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5728R \u571f 0.0001\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u5f97\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u7ed3\u679c.\n",

There are 3 cattle bruisers, the first of which starts at point (0, -3) and travels 4 units per second in the y-direction. The maximum distance for a cattle bruiser to be in range of Bessie is 1 unit.\n\n\nAt time 1.5, Bessie is at point (0, 3), and the three bruisers are at points (0, 3), (-0.5, 3.5), and (4, -3.5). The first two cattle bruisers are within 1 unit of Bessie, while the third will never be within 1 unit of Bessie, so 2 is the most achievable.\n"
