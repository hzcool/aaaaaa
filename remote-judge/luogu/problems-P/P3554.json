    "description": "The king of Byteotia, Byteasar, is returning to his country after a victorious battle.\n\nIn Byteotia, there are ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/luk-en-tex.1.png) towns connected with only ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/luk-en-tex.2.png) roads.\n\nIt is known that every town can be reached from every other town by a unique route,    consisting of one or more (direct) roads.\n\n    (In other words, the road network forms a tree).\n\nThe king has just entered the capital.\n\nTherein a triumphal arch, i.e., a gate a victorious king rides through, has been erected.\n\nByteasar, delighted by a warm welcome by his subjects, has planned a    triumphal procession to visit all the towns of Byteotia, starting with the capital he is currently in.\n\nThe other towns are not ready to greet their king just yet -    the constructions of the triumphal arches in those towns did not even begin!\n\nBut Byteasar's trusted advisor is seeing to the issue.\n\n    He desires to hire a number of construction crews.\n\n    Every crew can construct a single arch each day, in any town.\n\n    Unfortunately, no one knows the order in which the king will visit the towns.\n\nThe only thing that is clear is that every day the king will travel from the city he is currently in to a neighboring one.\n\nThe king may visit any town an arbitrary number of times    (but as he is not vain, one arch in each town will suffice).\n\nByteasar's advisor has to pay each crew the same flat fee, regardless of how many arches this crew builds.\n\nThus, while he needs to ensure that every town has an arch when it is visited by the king, he wants to hire as few crews as possible.\n\nHelp him out by writing a program that will determine the minimum number    of crews that allow a timely delivery of the arches.\n\n\n\u7ed9\u4e00\u9897 $n$ \u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6811\uff08$n \\le 3 \\times 10^5$\uff09\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u65f6 $1$ \u53f7\u8282\u70b9\u88ab\u67d3\u9ed1\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u662f\u767d\u7684\u3002\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eba\u8f6e\u6d41\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb B \u5728 $1$ \u53f7\u8282\u70b9\u3002\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\uff0cA \u9009\u62e9 $k$ \u4e2a\u70b9\u67d3\u9ed1\uff0c\u7136\u540e B \u8d70\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f8\u90bb\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5982\u679c B \u5f53\u524d\u5904\u4e8e\u767d\u70b9\u5219 B \u80dc\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u5f53 A \u5c06\u6240\u6709\u70b9\u67d3\u4e3a\u9ed1\u70b9\u65f6 A \u80dc\u3002\u6c42\u80fd\u8ba9 A \u83b7\u80dc\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u7684 $k$ \u3002\n",
