    "description": "You are switching from computer science to agriculture and your new job involves growing sun\ufb02owers in an underground greenhouse. The greenhouse contains n sun\ufb02ower plants arranged in a straight line and numbered with integers 1 through n, from left to right. Two lamps provide the light and heat the sun\ufb02owers need to grow: the lamp A is positioned at the left end, while the lamp B is positioned at the right end of the line. \n\nEvery day exactly one of the lamps is on, causing all of the sun\ufb02owers to turn towards the light and some of them to grow. The sun\ufb02ower will grow if and only if the sun\ufb02ower directly in front of it (towards the light) is higher. The growth is continuous with a uniform rate of exactly 1 centimeter per day. Notice that, when a sun\ufb02ower starts to grow, it may cause the sun\ufb02ower directly behind it to start to grow instantaneously.\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/pic/16238.png )\n\nYou are given initial heights of the sun\ufb02owers and the lamp schedule for the following m day period, \ufb01nd the \ufb01nal heights of all the sun\ufb02owers.",

The following line contains n integers h1,h2,...,hn (1\u2264 hk \u2264$10^9$) \u2013 the initial heights (in centimeters) of the sun\ufb02owers, from left to right. \n\nThe following line contains a string consisting of exactly m characters A or B \u2013 the lamp schedule starting from the \ufb01rst day of the period.",
