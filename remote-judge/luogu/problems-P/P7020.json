    "description": "\n\nBoolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is known to be a very hard problem in computer science. In this problem you are given a Boolean formula, and you need to find out if the variables of a given formula can be consistently replaced by the values true or false in such a way that the formula evaluates to true. SAT is known to be NP-complete problem. Moreover, it is NP-complete even in case of $3-CNF$ formula $(3-SAT).$ However, for example, SAT problem for $2-CNF$ formulae $(2-SAT)$ is in $P$ .\n\n$#SAT$ is the extension of SAT problem. In this problem you need to check if it is possible, and count the number of ways to assign values to variables. This problem is known to be $#P-complete$ even for $2-CNF$ formulae. We ask you to solve $#1-DNF-SAT,$ which is $#SAT$ problem for $1-DNF$ formulae.\n\nYou are given a Boolean formula in $1-DNF$ form. It means that it is a disjunction (logical or) of one or more clauses, each clause is exactly one literal, each literal is either variable or its negation (logical not).\n\nFormally:\n\n$\u2329formula\u232a ::= \u2329clause\u232a | \u2329formula\u232a \u2228 \u2329clause\u232a$\n\n$\u2329clause\u232a ::= \u2329literal\u232a$\n\n$\u2329literal\u232a ::= \u2329variable\u232a | \u00ac \u2329variable\u232a$\n\n$\u2329variable\u232a ::=$ A . . . $Z |$ a . . . $z$\n\nYour task is to find the number of ways to replace all variables with values true and false (all occurrences of the same variable should be replaced with same value), such that the formula evaluates to true.\n\n",
