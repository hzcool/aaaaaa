    "description": "\n\nFor a long time, there were no problems with water in Central City. The sewage of the city has a form\u00a0of a rooted tree: the central reservoir is situated at the root and the houses are at the leaves. The water flows from the central reservoir to the houses by the pipes that runs along the edges of the tree. Each house has an access to water.\n\nSuddenly, gangsters captured some of the houses. As a mayor of the city you are very concerned, and you\u00a0want to kick out the gangsters. So you want to stop the water flow to houses captured by the gangsters. \u00a0To do that you could clog some pipes of the sewage system. If the path from the reservoir to a house\u00a0contains at least one clogged pipe, the house does not have an access to water.\n\nYou are very afraid of the gangsters, so you decided to clog up the minimal number of pipes, that it\u00a0could look like an accident. At the same time, you care about the citizens, so for the chosen number of\u00a0clogged pipes, you want to minimize the number of houses without gangsters and access to water.\n\nUnfortunately, the gangsters could appear and disappear from some houses. So, you are asking the\u00a0scientists about the minimum required number of clogged pipes and the minimum required number of\u00a0houses without gangsters and access to water after each change in the gangsters' location.\n\n",
    "inputFormat": "\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ -- the number of vertices in the\u00a0tree which represents the sewage and the number of changes in the location of the gangsters\u00a0$(2 \\le n \\le 100 000$ ; $1 \\le q \\le 100 000)$ .\n\nThe second line contains the description of the sewage: a sequence of $n \u2212 1$ integers $p_{2}, p_{3},$ . . . , $p_{n}$, where\u00a0$p_{i}\u00a0is$ the parent of the vertex $i (1 \\le p_{i} < i)$ . The central reservoir is located at the vertex $1$ .\n\nThe next $q$ lines represent the changes in the location of the gangsters. Each change could be one of two\u00a0different types: \n\n- `+ v` -- the gangsters capture the house at vertex $v$ ; \n- `- v` -- the gangsters leave the\u00a0house at vertex $v$ .\n\nAt the beginning all the houses are free of gangsters. All the changes form the correct sequence: the\u00a0gangsters cannot capture the house if it is already captured and the gangsters could not leave the house\u00a0if it is not captured.\n\n",
    "outputFormat": "\n\nThe output should contain 2q integers, two in each line: $c_{i}$ -- the minimum number of clogged pipes and\u00a0$h_{i}$ -- the minimum number of houses without gangsters and have no access to water for the chosen $c_{i}$\n\n.\n\n",
