He wants to take a picture of some contiguous subsequence of the cows to submit to a bovine photography contest at the county fair.\n\nThe fair has a very strange rule about all submitted photos: a photograph is only valid to submit if it depicts a group of cows whose median height is at least a certain threshold X (1 <= X <= 1,000,000,000).\n\nFor purposes of this problem, we define the median of an array A[0...K] to be A[ceiling(K/2)] after A is sorted, where ceiling(K/2) gives K/2 rounded up to the nearest integer (or K/2 itself, it K/2 is an integer to begin with). For example the median of {7, 3, 2, 6} is 6, and the median of {5, 4, 8} is 5.\n\nPlease help FJ count the number of different contiguous subsequences of his cows that he could potentially submit to the photography contest.\n\n\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e32\u6570\u5b57\uff0c\u95ee\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u5927\u4e8e\u7b49\u4e8eX\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5b50\u4e32\u6709\u51e0\u4e2a\u3002\uff08\u8fd9\u91cc\u5982\u679c\u6709\u5076\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u504f\u5927\u7684\u90a3\u4e00\u4e2a\u800c\u975e\u4e2d\u95f4\u53d6\u5e73\u5747\uff09\n",
