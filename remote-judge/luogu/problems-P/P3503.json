    "description": "    Bytie has got a set of wooden blocks for his birthday.\n\nThe blocks are indistinguishable from one another, as they are all cubes of the same size.\n\n    Bytie forms piles by putting one block atop another.\n\nSoon he had a whole rank of such piles, one next to another in a straight line.\n\nOf course, the piles can have different heights.\n\nBytie's father, Byteasar, gave his son a puzzle.\n\nHe gave him a number ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/klo-en-tex.1.png) and asked to rearrange the blocks in such a way that    the number of successive piles of height at least ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/klo-en-tex.2.png) is maximised.\n\nHowever, Bytie is only ever allowed to pick the top block from a pile strictly    higher than ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/klo-en-tex.3.png) and place it atop one of the piles next to it.\n\nFurther, Bytie is not allowed to form new piles, he can only move blocks    between those already existing.\n\n",
