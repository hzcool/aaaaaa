    "description": "**In easy version, It is guaranteed that any string in array $\\mathbf a$ contains at least two different letters.**\n\nLily White is playing with strings. Being a yousei, she is not capable of complex speech. Thus, she likes strings that only contain one kind of letter, she calls such strings of length $x$ a \"$x$-CON string\". For example, `qqqq` is a \"$4$-CON string\", while `aaab` is not any type of \"CON string\".\n\nLily White composed an array $a$. It contains $n$ strings of length $m$ that she will use to herald spring. For each permutation of $1,2,\\ldots, n$, let us denote current permutation as $p=\\{p_1,p_2,\\cdots,p_n\\}$. Lily White concatenates all the string in array $a$ in the order of $a_{p_1},a_{p_2},\\cdots,a_{p_n}$ into a string $s$ of length $nm$ . \n\nAs she likes $k$-CON strings, she wants to know the sum of the number of \"$k$-CON string\" in all non-empty substrings of $s$ composed by all $n!$ permutations. Since the answer may be enormous, just print the answer taken modulo $998,244,353$ (a large prime).\n",
    "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $n,m,k$.\n\nThen $n$ lines follow, each line contains a string of length $m$. The string in the$(i+1)$-th line represents $a_i$.",

    "hint": "### Explanation\n\n#### Sample \\#1\n\n- For permutation $1,2,3$, the formed $s$ is `aabbaabaa`, none on the non-empty substring in this string are \"$4$-CON string\".\n- For permutation $1,3,2$, the formed $s$ is `aabbaabaa`, none on the non-empty substring in this string are \"$4$-CON string\".\n- For permutation $2,1,3$, the formed $s$ is `baaaabbaa`, this string has one substring `aaaa` which is a \"$4$-CON string\".\n- For permutation $2,3,1$, the formed $s$ is `baabaaaab`, this string has one substring `aaaa` which is a \"$4$-CON string\".\n- For permutation $3,1,2$, the formed $s$ is `baaaabbaa`, this string has one substring `aaaa` which is a \"$4$-CON string\".\n- For permutation $3,2,1$, the formed $s$ is `baabaaaab`, this string has one substring `aaaa` which is a \"$4$-CON string\".\n\nIn summary, the answer is $0+0+1+1+1+1=4$.\n\n#### Sample \\#2\n\nIn all of the full permutation of length $3$, there will be six different $s$: `xyzqaqaba`, `xyzabaqaq`, `qaqxyzaba`, `qaqabaxyz`, `abaqaqxyz`, and `abaxyzqaq`. None of these has a non-empty substrings which is a \"$2$-CON string\". So the answer is $0$.\n\n### Constraints\n\n$2\\le k \\le n\\cdot m\\le 10^6;\\ 1\\le m \\le 100$. $a_i$ contains only lowercase English letters.\n\n**In easy version, we ensure that any string in array $\\mathbf a$ contains at least two different letters.**",
