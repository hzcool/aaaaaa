    "description": "\n\nJoker prepares a new card trick with a strong mathematical background. You are asked to help Joker with calculations.\n\nThere is a row of $n$ cards with non-zero numbers $a_{i}$ written on them. Let's call the sum of all positive numbers $P$ and the sum of all negative numbers $N$ . Every card $i$ has a weight $w_{i} = a_{i}/P$ if $a_{i} > 0$ and $a_{i}/|N|$ otherwise.\n\nLet's denote $s_{i} = ( \\sum_{j=1}^{j \\le i}{w_j})$. Joker needs to know positive $i$ with the largest $s_{i}.$ If there is more than one such $i$ , he is interested in the smallest one.\n\nBut static tricks are boring, so Joker wants to change numbers on some cards, and after each change he needs to known where is the largest $s_{i}$ is.\n\n",
    "inputFormat": "\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ -- the number of cards and the number of changes $(1 \\le n , m \\le 50 000)$ .\n\nThe second line consists of $n$ integers $a_{i}$ -- numbers written on cards at the beginning $(\u221210^{9} \\le a_{i} \\le 10^{9}; a_{i} \u2260 0)$ .\n\nThe following $m$ lines contain two integers each: $p_{i}$ and $v_{i},$ that means value of card at position $p_{i}$ is changed to $v_{i} (1 \\le p_{i} \\le n$ ; $\u221210^{9} \\le v_{i} \\le 10^{9}; v_{i} \u2260\u00a00)$ .\n\nIt is guaranteed that at each moment there is at least one card with positive number and at least one card with negative number. The sum of all positive cards will never exceed $10^{9}$ and the sum of all negative cards will never exceed $\u221210^{9}.$\n\n",
    "outputFormat": "\n\nYou should output $m+1$ integers. The first integer is the position of the largest $s_{i}$ for the initial numbers. Next $m$ numbers are positions of the largest $s_{i}$ after each change.\n\n",
