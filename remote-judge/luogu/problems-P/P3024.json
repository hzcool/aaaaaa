    "description": "One day, Bessie decides to challenge Farmer John to a game of 'Cow Checkers'. The game is played on an M\\*N (1 <= M <= 1,000,000; 1 <= N <= 1,000,000) checkerboard that initially contains a single checker piece on the checkboard square coordinates (X, Y) (0 <= X < M; 0 <= Y < N). The bottom leftmost square of the checkerboard has\n\ncoordinates (0, 0), and the top rightmost square has coordinates (M-1, N-1). Bessie always moves first, and then the two players alternate turns.  Each turn comprises one of three types of moves:\n\n1) Move the checker piece to any square on the same row to the left of its current position.\n\n2) Move the checker piece to any square on the same column below its current position.\n\n3) Move the checker piece to any spot k squares below and k squares to the left of the current square (where k is any positive integer such that this new spot is still on the checkerboard).\n\nThe first player unable to make a move (i.e., because the checker is at (0, 0)) loses. Given that Bessie always goes first, determine who will win the game if both play optimally.\n\nPlay and report the winner for T games (1 <= T <= 1,000) reading in a new X,Y starting value for each new game.\n\n\u6709\u4e00\u5929\uff0cBessie\u51c6\u5907\u73a9\u4e00\u4e2a\u53eb\u505a\u5976\u725b\u8df3\u68cb\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6765\u6311\u6218Farmer John\u3002\n\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u68cb\u76d8\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a M\\*N (1 <= M <= 1,000,000; 1 <= N <= 1,000,000) \u3002\u6700\u521d\u68cb\u76d8\u4e0a\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u68cb\u5b50\u5728\uff08x,y\uff09\uff0c\u68cb\u76d8\u7684\u5de6\u4e0b\u89d2\u5750\u6807\u662f\uff080,0\uff09\uff0c\u53f3\u4e0a\u89d2\u7684\u5750\u6807\u662f\uff08M-1\uff0cN-1\uff09\u3002\n\n\n\u6bcf\u6b21\u6e38\u620fBessie\u90fd\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u4e4b\u540e\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eba\u8f6e\u6d41\u3002\n\n\n\u6bcf\u6b21\u4e0b\u68cb\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u90fd\u6709\u4e09\u79cd\u8d70\u6cd5\uff1a\n\n\n1.\u5411\u5de6\u8d70\u4efb\u610f\u6b65\n\n\n2.\u5411\u4e0b\u8d70\u4efb\u610f\u6b65\n\n\n3.\u5411\u5de6\u8d70k\u6b65\u7136\u540e\u5411\u4e0b\u8d70k\u6b65\uff08k\u53ef\u968f\u4fbf\u53d6\u503c\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u4e0d\u8d70\u51fa\u68cb\u76d8\uff09\n\n\n\u9996\u5148\u8d70\u5230\uff080,0\uff09\u7684\u4eba\u4e3a\u80dc\u5229\u8005\u3002\n\n\n\u6e38\u620f\u5171\u6709T\u6b21\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u90fd\u4f1a\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5750\u6807\uff08x,y\uff09\uff0c\u8bf7\u8f93\u51fa\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u8d62\u5bb6\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u3002\n",
