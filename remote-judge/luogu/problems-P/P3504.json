    "description": "The habitants of the Byteotian Highland bred sheep for centuries.\n\nEvery sane shepherd has a fenced pasture in the shape of a convex1 polygon    for the sheep to graze on.\n\nEvery sane sheep in turn has its own favourite feeding spot on the pasture where it spends all days.\n\nSometimes however, the sheep want to play. As they play in pairs, every shepherd keeps an even number of sheep,    so that his every sheep has a partner to play with.\n\nThe shepherds are concerned about a decree recently issued by the Byteburg's High Commissioner for Agriculture.\n\nThe decree states that as of the next year the sheep can only graze on triangle-shaped pastures.\n\nThus every shepherd whose pasture is an ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/owc-en-tex.1.png)-gon for ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/owc-en-tex.2.png) is to partition it into triangles by putting ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/owc-en-tex.3.png)    fences inside.\n\nEach single new fence, of course, is going to be a segment connecting two vertices of the polygon (pasture).\n\nAdditionally, the fences can intersect only in these vertices.\n\nA shepherd who does not fulfil these requirements will no longer be subsidized.\n\nByteasar, as a shepherd, has to decide on a way of partitioning his pasture.\n\nIn fact, he is unsure how many partitions are possible. He is only interested in such partitions    that no fence is drawn through a favourite spot of any sheep, and such that every resulting triangle    contains the favourite spots of an even number of sheep, so that these sheep can play in pairs.\n\nHelp Byteasar by writing a program that calculates the number of such partitions!\n",
