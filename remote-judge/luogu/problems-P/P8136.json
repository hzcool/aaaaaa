    "description": "To relax before competing in the ICPC World Finals, you have decided to play a\ncomputer game called *Quests*. You have played it a\nnumber of times already, and now you want to achieve a perfect\nplaythrough---to prepare for your perfect playthrough of the finals!\n\nIn the game, you have to complete a number\nof quests, and you earn experience points (XPs) for completing each one. The\ntotal number of XPs you have earned at any time determines your current level. You\nreach a new level for every $v$ XPs that you earn. Formally, your level at\nany time is the largest integer $L$ such that you have at least $L \\cdot v$\nXPs.\n\nEach quest is assigned a number $x$ of XPs and a target\ndifficulty level $d$. If you complete the quest when your level is at least\n$d$, you earn $x$ XPs. However, if you complete the quest when your level is\nless than $d$, you will earn $c \\cdot x$ XPs. The constant  $c$ is an XP multiplier\nthat results in a bonus for completing a\nquest when you are at a lower level than the recommended level $d$.\n\nYou know all the $n$ quests and their respective $x$ and $d$ numbers by heart\n(and you know the numbers $v$ and $c$ as well---you have played this game a lot).\nYou are also skilled enough to\ncomplete any quest, regardless of its target difficulty level and your level.\nYou want to complete all the quests in an order that will allow you\nto earn the largest possible number of XPs.\n\nFor example in the sample input, the maximum XPs you can earn is 43, which\nis done as follows. First complete the second quest (you earn $4$ XPs,\nbecause you are at level $0$, and you completed a quest with target difficulty\nlevel $2$). Then complete the first quest (you earn $30$ XPs, because you are\nstill at level $0$, and the target difficulty level is $1$). With $34$ XPs, you\nare now level $3$. Finally, complete the third quest (for which you earn $9$\nXPs, without the multiplier, since you are already at level $3$).",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains three integers $n$, $v$, and $c$, where\n$n$ $(1 \\leq n \\leq 2\\,000)$ is the number of quests in the game, $v$\n$(1 \\leq v \\leq 2\\,000)$ is the number of XPs required to reach each level,\nand $c$ $(2 \\leq c \\leq 2\\,000)$ is the XP multiplier for completing a quest\nbefore reaching its target difficulty level.\n\nFollowing that are $n$ lines, each of which contains two integers $x$ and $d$\ndescribing one quest, where $x$ $(1 \\leq x \\leq 2\\,000)$ is the number of XPs\nyou earn for completing that quest if you are at or above its target difficulty\nlevel and $d$ $(1 \\leq d_i \\leq 10^6)$ is the target difficulty level for that\nquest.",
