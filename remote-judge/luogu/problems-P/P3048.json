    "description": "Being a secret computer geek, Farmer John labels all of his cows with binary numbers. However, he is a bit superstitious, and only labels cows with binary numbers that have exactly K \"1\" bits $(1 \\le K \\le 10)$. The leading bit of each label is always a \"1\" bit, of course. FJ assigns labels in increasing numeric order, starting from the smallest possible valid label -- a K-bit number consisting of all \"1\" bits. Unfortunately, he loses track of his labeling and needs your help: please determine the Nth label he should assign $(1 \\le N \\le 10^7)$.\n\nFJ \u7ed9\u4ed6\u7684\u5976\u725b\u7528\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u53f7\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7f16\u53f7\u6070\u597d\u5305\u542b $K$ \u4e2a $1$\uff08$1 \\le K \\le 10$\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5fc5\u987b\u662f $1$ \u5f00\u5934\u3002FJ \u6309\u5347\u5e8f\u7f16\u53f7\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f16\u53f7\u662f\u7531 $K$ \u4e2a $1$ \u7ec4\u6210\u3002\n\n\u8bf7\u95ee\u7b2c $N$\uff08$1 \\le N \\le 10^7$\uff09\u4e2a\u7f16\u53f7\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u3002",
