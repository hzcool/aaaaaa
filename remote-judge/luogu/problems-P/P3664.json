    "description": "Art critics worldwide have only recently begun to recognize the creative genius behind the great bovine painter, Picowso.\n\n\nPicowso paints in a very particular way. She starts with an $N \\times N$ blank canvas, represented by an $N \\times N$ grid of zeros, where a zero indicates an empty cell of the canvas. She then draws $N^2$ rectangles on the canvas, one in each of $N^2$ colors (conveniently numbered $1 \\ldots N^2$). For example, she might start by painting a rectangle in color 2, giving this intermediate canvas:\n\n\n\n2 2 2 0\n\n2 2 2 0\n\n2 2 2 0\n\n0 0 0 0\n\n\n\n\n\nShe might then paint a rectangle in color 7:\n\n2 2 2 0\n\n2 7 7 7\n\n2 7 7 7\n\n0 0 0 0\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then she might paint a small rectangle in color 3:\n\n2 2 3 0\n\n2 7 3 7\n\n2 7 7 7\n\n0 0 0 0\n\n\n\nEach rectangle has sides parallel to the edges of the canvas, and a rectangle could be as large as the entire canvas or as small as a single cell. Each color from $1 \\ldots N^2$ is used exactly once, although later colors might completely cover up some of the earlier colors.\n\n\nGiven the final state of the canvas, please count how many of the $N^2$ colors could have possibly been the first to be painted.\n\n\u5c0fTY\u7a81\u7136\u60f3\u753b\u753b\uff0c\u4ed6\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eceN\u00d7N\u7a7a\u767d\u753b\u5e03\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d0\u8868\u793a\u753b\u5e03\u7684\u7a7a\u5355\u5143\u683c\u3002\u7136\u540e\u4ed6\u4f1a\u5728\u753b\u5e03\u4e0a\u7ed8\u5236\u6070\u597d\u77e9\u5f62\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u989c\u8272\u662f1\u5230N\u00d7N\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u3002\u4ed6\u6bcf\u6b21\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u610f\u4e00\u79cd\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc7\u7684\u989c\u8272\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed8\u753b\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u4ed6\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u989c\u82722\u7684\u77e9\u5f62\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u753b\u51fa\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u753b\u5e03\uff1a\n\n\n2 2 2 0\n\n\n2 2 2 0\n\n\n2 2 2 0\n\n\n0 0 0 0\n\n\n\u7136\u540e\u4ed6\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u989c\u82727\u7ed8\u5236\u4e00\u4e2a\u77e9\u5f62\uff1a\n\n\n2 2 2 0\n\n\n2 7 7 7\n\n\n2 7 7 7\n\n\n0 0 0 0\n\n\n\u7136\u540e\u4ed6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u989c\u82723\u4e0a\u7ed8\u5236\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u77e9\u5f62\uff1a\n\n\n2 2 3 0\n\n\n2 7 3 7\n\n\n2 7 7 7\n\n\n0 0 0 0\n\n\n\u6bcf\u4e2a\u77e9\u5f62\u90fd\u5e73\u884c\u4e8e\u753b\u5e03\u8fb9\u7f18\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u77e9\u5f62\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u6574\u4e2a\u753b\u5e03\u4e00\u6837\u5927\u6216\u8005\u50cf\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u5143\u4e00\u6837\u5c0f\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u989c\u8272\u4ece1\u5230\u6b63\u597d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u540e\u6765\u7684\u989c\u8272\u53ef\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u8986\u76d6\u4e00\u4e9b\u8f83\u65e9\u753b\u4e0a\u7684\u989c\u8272\u3002\n\n\n\u73b0\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u753b\u5e03\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8bf7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u79cd\u989c\u8272\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u753b\u3002\n",
