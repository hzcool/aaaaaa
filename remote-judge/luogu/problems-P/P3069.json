    "description": "Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 100,000) are lined up in a row.  Each cow is identified by an integer \"breed ID\" in the range 0...1,000,000,000; the breed ID of the ith cow in the lineup is B(i).  Multiple cows can share the same breed ID.\n\nFJ thinks that his line of cows will look much more impressive if there is a large contiguous block of cows that all have the same breed ID.  In order to create such a block, FJ chooses up to K breed IDs and removes from his lineup all the cows having those IDs.  Please help FJ figure out the length of the largest consecutive block of cows with the same breed ID that he can create by doing this.\n\n\u519c\u592b\u7ea6\u7ff0\u7684N(1 <= N <= 100,000)\u53ea\u5976\u725b\u6392\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u961f\uff0c\u6bcf\u53ea\u725b\u90fd\u7528\u7f16\u4e0a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u8840\u7edf\u7f16\u53f7\u201d\uff0c\u8be5\u7f16\u53f7\u4e3a\u8303\u56f40...1,000,000,000\u7684\u6574\u6570\u3002\u8840\u7edf\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5976\u725b\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7f16\u53f7\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u591a\u5934\u5976\u725b\u662f\u76f8\u540c\u7684\"\u8840\u7edf\u7f16\u53f7\"\u3002\n\n\u7ea6\u7ff0\u89c9\u5f97\u5982\u679c\u8fde\u7eed\u6392\u5217\u7684\u4e00\u6bb5\u5976\u725b\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8840\u7edf\u7f16\u53f7\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u5976\u725b\u4eec\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f1a\u66f4\u5177\u6709\u5a01\u731b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u521b\u9020\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6bb5\uff0c\u7ea6\u7ff0\u6700\u591a\u80fd\u9009\u51fak\u79cd\u8840\u7edf\u7684\u5976\u725b\uff0c\u5e76\u628a\u4ed6\u4eec\u5168\u90e8\u4ece\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u8d76\u8d70\u3002\n\n\n\u8bf7\u5e2e\u52a9\u7ea6\u7ff0\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7531\u76f8\u540c\u8840\u7edf\u7f16\u53f7\u7684\u725b\u6784\u6210\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6bb5\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u6700\u5927\u662f\u591a\u5c11\uff1f\n",
