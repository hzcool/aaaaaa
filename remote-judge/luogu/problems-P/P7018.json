    "description": "A bus with $n$ passengers opens its door at the bus stop. Exactly half of its passengers and an additional half of a passenger get out. On the next stop, again, half of the passengers plus half of a passenger leave the bus. This goes on for $k$ stops in total. Knowing that the bus leaves the last stop empty, and that no one was hurt during the trip, determine the initial number $n$ of people in the bus.",
