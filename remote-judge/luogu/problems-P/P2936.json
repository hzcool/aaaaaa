    "description": "Farmer John always wants his cows to have enough water and thus has made a map of the N (1 <= N <= 700) water pipes on the farm that connect the well to the barn. He was surprised to find a wild mess of different size pipes connected in an apparently haphazard way. He wants to calculate the flow through the pipes.\n\nTwo pipes connected in a row allow water flow that is the minimum of the values of the two pipe's flow values. The example of a pipe with flow capacity 5 connecting to a pipe of flow capacity 3 can be reduced logically to a single pipe of flow capacity 3:\n\n+---5---+---3---+    ->    +---3---+\n\nSimilarly, pipes in parallel let through water that is the sum of their flow capacities:\n\n+---5---+\n\n---+       +---    ->    +---8---+\n\n+---3---+\n\nFinally, a pipe that connects to nothing else can be removed; it contributes no flow to the final overall capacity:\n\n+---5---+\n\n---+               ->    +---3---+\n\n+---3---+--\n\nAll the pipes in the many mazes of plumbing can be reduced using these ideas into a single total flow capacity.\n\nGiven a map of the pipes, determine the flow capacity between the well (A) and the barn (Z).\n\nConsider this example where node names are labeled with letters:\n\n+-----------6-----------+\n\nA+---3---+B                      +Z\n\n+---3---+---5---+---4---+\n\nC       D\n\nPipe BC and CD can be combined:\n\n+-----------6-----------+\n\nA+---3---+B                      +Z\n\n+-----3-----+-----4-----+\n\nD\nThen BD and DZ can be combined: \n\n+-----------6-----------+\n\nA+---3---+B                      +Z\n\n+-----------3-----------+\n\nThen two legs of BZ can be combined: \n\nB\nA+---3---+---9---+Z\n\nThen AB and BZ can be combined to yield a net capacity of 3:\n\nA+---3---+Z\n\nWrite a program to read in a set of pipes described as two endpoints and then calculate the net flow capacity from 'A' to 'Z'. All\n\nnetworks in the test data can be reduced using the rules here.\n\nPipe i connects two different nodes a\\_i and b\\_i (a\\_i in range\n\n'A-Za-z'; b\\_i in range 'A-Za-z') and has flow F\\_i (1 <= F\\_i <= 1,000). Note that lower- and upper-case node names are intended to be treated as different.\n\nThe system will provide extra test case feedback for your first 50 submissions.\n\n\u7ea6\u7ff0\u603b\u5e0c\u671b\u4ed6\u7684\u5976\u725b\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u6c34\u559d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4ed6\u627e\u6765\u4e86\u519c\u573a\u7684\u6c34\u7ba1\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u60f3\u7b97\u7b97\u725b\u68da\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6c34\u7684 \u603b\u6d41\u91cf.\u519c\u573a\u91cc\u4e00\u5171\u6709N\u6839\u6c34\u7ba1.\u7ea6\u7ff0\u53d1\u73b0\u6c34\u7ba1\u7f51\u7edc\u6df7\u4e71\u4e0d\u582a\uff0c\u4ed6\u8bd5\u56fe\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80 \u5316.\u4ed6\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff1a\n\n\u4e24\u6839\u6c34\u7ba1\u4e32\u8054\uff0c\u5219\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u8f83\u5c0f\u6d41\u91cf\u7684\u90a3\u6839\u6c34\u7ba1\u4ee3\u66ff\u603b\u6d41\u91cf.\n\n\u4e24\u6839\u6c34\u7ba1\u5e76\u8054\uff0c\u5219\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u6d41\u91cf\u4e3a\u4e24\u6839\u6c34\u7ba1\u6d41\u91cf\u548c\u7684\u4e00\u6839\u6c34\u7ba1\u4ee3\u66ff\u5b83\u4eec\n\n\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u6839\u6c34\u7ba1\u4e00\u7aef\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u5b83\u79fb\u9664.\n\n\n\u8bf7\u5199\u4e2a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7b97\u51fa\u4ece\u6c34\u4e95A\u5230\u725b\u68daZ\u7684\u603b\u6d41\u91cf.\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6240\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6c34\u7ba1\u7f51\u7edc\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e0a\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5 \u7b80\u5316.\n\n## 2019.2.21 \u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6ce8\uff1a\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u542b\u6709\u5c0f\u5199\u5b57\u6bcd\u3002",
