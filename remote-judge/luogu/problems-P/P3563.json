So what?\n\n  Faced for years on, a peril becomes the every-day reality.\n\nIt loses its meaning...\n\nToday the letter of the Bitotian char Bittard to the Byteotian king Byteasar  was released to the public.\n\nBitotia requested annexation of the whole Byteotia on pain of using  the Bit Polarizing Magnet (BPM).\n\nIf used, the BPM would make each and every road in Byteotia unidirectional.\n\nThe enemy knows only too well that this could be a fatal blow to the  minimalist Byteotian infrastructure - there is a unique way between  each pair of towns.\n\n  How badly can the BPM damage the Byteotian infrastructure?\n\nDetermine the minimum and the maximum number of such pairs of towns that  it will still be possible to travel from one of them to the other while  observing the new roads orientation.\n\n\n",
