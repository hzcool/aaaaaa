    "description": " \n\nThe cows are out exercising their hooves again!  There are N cows\n\njogging on an infinitely-long single-lane track (1 <= N <= 100,000).\n\nEach cow starts at a distinct position on the track, and some cows jog\n\nat different speeds.\n\n\n \n\nWith only one lane in the track, cows cannot pass each other.  When a\n\nfaster cow catches up to another cow, she has to slow down to avoid\n\nrunning into the other cow, becoming part of the same running group.\n\n \n\nThe cows will run for T minutes (1 <= T <= 1,000,000,000).  Please\n\nhelp Farmer John determine how many groups will be left at this time.\n\nTwo cows should be considered part of the same group if they are at\n\n\nthe same position at the end of T minutes. \n\n\u6709N (1 <= N <= 100,000)\u5934\u5976\u725b\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4eba\u7684\u8d85\u957f\u8dd1\u9053\u4e0a\u6162\u8dd1\uff0c\u6bcf\u5934\u725b\u7684\u8d77\u70b9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u90fd\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u662f\u5355\u4eba\u8dd1\u9053\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f8\u4e92\u8d85\u8d8a\u3002\u5f53\u4e00\u5934\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u7684\u5976\u725b\u8ffd\u4e0a\u53e6\u5916\u4e00\u5934\u5976\u725b\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4ed6\u5fc5\u987b\u964d\u901f\u6210\u540c\u7b49\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u628a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8dd1\u8d70\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u800c\u4e14\u540c\u7b49\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u725b\u770b\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u7ec4\u3002\n\n\n\u8bf7\u8ba1\u7b97T (1 <= T <= 1,000,000,000)\u65f6\u95f4\u540e\uff0c\u5976\u725b\u4eec\u5c06\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u5c11\u5c0f\u7ec4\u3002\n\n",
