    "description": "Ryo and Kita are designing a new poster for Kessoku Band. After some furious brainstorming, they came to the conclusion that the poster should come in the form of a $2\\text{-D}$ grid of lowercase English letters (i.e. `a` to `z`), with $N$ rows and $M$ columns.\n\nFurthermore, it is known that Ryo and Kita both have peculiar tastes in palindromes. Ryo will only be satisfied with the poster if exactly $R$ of its rows are palindromes, and Kita will only be satisfied with the poster if exactly $C$ of its columns are palindromes. Can you design a poster that will satisfy both Ryo and Kita, or determine that it is impossible to do so?\n\n**Note**: A string is considered a palindrome if it is the same when read forwards and backwards. For example, `kayak` and `bb` are palindromes, whereas `guitar` and `live` are not.\n",
