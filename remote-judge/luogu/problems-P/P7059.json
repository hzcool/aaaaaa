    "description": "\n\nLucky Chances is a lottery game. Each lottery ticket has a play field and a scratch area. The play field is a rectangular $r \\times c$ field filled with numbers. The scratch area hides row and column numbers that specify the bet cell.\n\nThere are four possible winning directions: up, down, left and right. You win a direction if all numbers in this direction from the bet cell are strictly less than a number in the bet cell. And if the bet cell is on the edge of the grid, you win the corresponding direction automatically!\n\n![](https://onlinejudgeimages.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/problem/11477/1.png)\n\nUnscratched ticket\n\n![](https://onlinejudgeimages.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/problem/11477/2.png)\n\nScratched ticket $1$\n\n![](https://onlinejudgeimages.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/problem/11477/3.png)\n\nScratched ticket $2$\n\nLarry wants to choose the ticket that has maximum total number of winning directions for all possible bet cells. Write a program that determines this number for the given grid.\n\n",
