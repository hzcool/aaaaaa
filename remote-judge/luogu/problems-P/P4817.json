    "description": "Bessie has broken into Farmer John's house again! She has discovered a pile of lemons and a pile of oranges in the kitchen (effectively an unlimited number of each), and she is determined to eat as much as possible.\n\nBessie has a maximum fullness of $T$ $(1 \u2264 T \u2264 5,000,000)$. Eating an orange increases her fullness by $A$, and eating a lemon increases her fullness by $B$ ($1 \u2264 A,B \u2264 T$). Additionally, if she wants, Bessie can drink water at most one time, which will instantly decrease her fullness by half (and will round down).\n\nHelp Bessie determine the maximum fullness she can achieve!
