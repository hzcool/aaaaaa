    "description": "Farmer John is an astounding accounting wizard and has realized he might run out of money to run the farm. He has already calculated and recorded the exact amount of money (1 \u2264 moneyi \u2264 10,000) that he will need to spend each day over the next N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 100,000) days.\n\nFJ wants to create a budget for a sequential set of exactly M (1 \u2264 M \u2264 N) fiscal periods called \"fajomonths\". Each of these fajomonths contains a set of 1 or more consecutive days. Every day is contained in exactly one fajomonth.\n\nFJ's goal is to arrange the fajomonths so as to minimize the expenses of the fajomonth with the highest spending and thus determine his monthly spending limit.\n\n\u7ed9\u51fa\u519c\u592b\u5728n\u5929\u4e2d\u6bcf\u5929\u7684\u82b1\u8d39\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u628a\u8fd9n\u5929\u5206\u4f5cm\u7ec4\uff0c\u6bcf\u7ec4\u7684\u5929\u6570\u5fc5\u7136\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u5206\u5f97\u5404\u7ec4\u7684\u82b1\u8d39\u4e4b\u548c\u5e94\u8be5\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u5730\u5c0f\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8f93\u51fa\u5404\u7ec4\u82b1\u8d39\u4e4b\u548c\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u503c\n",
