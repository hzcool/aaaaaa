    "description": "Farmer John has purchased a new machine that is capable of planting grass within any rectangular region of his farm that is \"axially aligned\" (i.e., with vertical and horizontal sides).  Unfortunately, the machine malfunctions one day and plants grass in not one, but N (1 <= N <= 1000) different rectangular regions, some of which may even overlap.\n\nGiven the rectangular regions planted with grass, please help FJ compute the total area in his farm that is now covered with grass.\n\n\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u5e73\u9762\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u91cc\uff08\u5219X\u8f74\u5411\u53f3\u662f\u6b63\u65b9\u5411\uff0cY\u8f74\u5411\u4e0a\u662f\u6b63\u65b9\u5411\uff09\uff0c\u6709N($1<=N<=1000$)\u4e2a\u77e9\u5f62\uff0c\u7b2ci\u4e2a\u77e9\u5f62\u7684\u5de6\u4e0a\u89d2\u5750\u6807\u662f(x1, y1),\u53f3\u4e0b\u89d2\u5750\u6807\u662f\uff08x2,y2\uff09\u3002\u95ee\u8fd9N\u4e2a\u77e9\u5f62\u6240\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u9762\u79ef\u662f\u591a\u5c11\uff1f\u6ce8\u610f\uff1a\u88ab\u91cd\u590d\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9762\u79ef\u53ea\u7b97\u4e00\u6b21\u3002\n",
