    "description": "The biggest event of the year ended tragically for Croatian teams. The most influential theoretician of CERC of all time, the founder of the popular page CERC Tips, and in his free time an outstanding bass player, in his most recent performance failed to get his team to the finals.\n\nIn order to get over his existential troubles, our subject is spending time playing games of chance. He is especially interested in the following game:\n\nYou are given a positive integer M. Our protagonist sees in front of him a **permutation** of an array of numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., $2^M$- 1.\n\nThe computer chooses a **nonempty contiguous subsequence** of the given permutation, which it then lights up over a capital city of one of the countries in Southeastern Europe.\n\nOur confidant, after fighting off tears caused by memories of old times, **must** choose two distinct elements of the permutation and **swap their places**\u200b. Our man of the hour wins if and only if the **bitwise XOR** of the numbers in the lit up subsequence after the substitution is **precisely**\u200b $2^M$- 1.\n\nOur hero wants to know **the number of contiguous subsequences** \u200bthe computer can light up so that he can win.\n\nHelp our hero overcome his (id)entity crisis so our favourite page can be fully active again.\n",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains the integer M (1 \u2264 M \u2264 20),\n\nThe following line contains $2^M$ space-separated numbers that make up a permutation of the array 0, 1, 2, ..., $2^M$- 1.\n",

In this case, he can actually win for every chosen contiguous subsequence, except the entire array.\n\nIn the second test case, if the computer chooses the entire array [3 7 0 4 6 1 5 2] as the lit up subsequence, our hero can\u2019t change the XOR of the subsequence (which is 0), no matter which two elements are swapped.",
