    "description": "Life is tough on the farm, and when life is tough you have to get tough. The cows have formed gangs (conveniently numbered 1 to M).  The gangs coexisted in peace for a while, but now things are really getting out of control!\n\nThe cows are competing over control of a great grazing field.  This conflict happens over a series of minutes.  Each minute a single cow walks into the field.  If the field is empty the new cow's gang is considered to take control of the field.  If the field is already controlled by the new cow's gang then the cow just starts grazing.  Otherwise, a single cow from the controlling gang that is grazing confronts the new cow.\n\nThese confrontations between two cows start with some arguing and inevitably end up with the pair coming to realize how much more more alike than different they are.  The cows, seeing the error in their ways, leave the gang and the field and get a cold glass of soy milk at FJ's tavern.  If after this confrontation the field is empty than no gang controls the field.\n\nBessie realizes how these confrontations will occur.  She knows how many cows are in each gang.  Bessie really wants her gang to control the field after the conflict is over and all cows are either on the field or at FJ's tavern.  Help Bessie determine if it is possible for her gang, labeled 1, to control the field in the end.\n\nIf it is possible, Bessie wants to know the maximum number of cows from her gang that could be on the field at the end.  Output this number and the lexicographically earliest ordering of cows that results in this number of cows from Bessie's gang at the end.  An ordering X is said to be lexicographically earlier than Y if there is some k such that X[k] < Y[k] and X[i] = Y[i] for i < k.\n\nn\u5934\u725b\u7ed3\u6210\u4e86m\u4e2a\u5e2e\u6d3e\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u5b83\u4eec\u4e89\u593a\u4e00\u5757\u8349\u5730\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u4f1a\u6709\u4e00\u5934\u725b\u6765\u3002\u5982\u679c\u8349\u5730\u4e0a\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u725b\u6216\u8005\u53ea\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u5e2e\u6d3e\u7684\u725b\uff0c\u4ed6\u4f1a\u7559\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u3002\u4f46\u5982\u679c\u5df2\u7ecf\u6709\u522b\u7684\u5e2e\u6d3e\u7684\u725b\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4f1a\u6253\u4e00\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u5f53\u524d\u725b\u548c\u8349\u5730\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u5934\u725b\u53bb\u627e\u519c\u592b\u601d\u8003\u4eba\u751f\u3002\u95ee\u5982\u4f55\u5b89\u6392\u6765\u7684\u725b\u7684\u7f16\u53f7\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u80fd\u4f7f\u4e00  \u53f7\u5e2e\u6d3e\u6700\u540e\u6709\u6700\u591a\u7684\u725b\u7559\u5728\u8349\u5730\u4e0a\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u4e3a0\uff0c\u8fd8\u8981\u8f93\u51fa\u5b57\u5178\u5e8f\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u4e00\u7ec4\u65b9\u6848\u3002\n",
