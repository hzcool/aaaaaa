    "description": "Farmer John has recently purchased a new barn containing N milking machines (1 <= N <= 40,000), conveniently numbered 1..N and arranged in a row.\n\nMilking machine i is capable of extracting M(i) units of milk per day (1 <= M(i) <= 100,000).  Unfortunately, the machines were installed so close together that if a machine i is in use on a particular day, its two neighboring machines cannot be used that day (endpoint machines have only one neighbor, of course).  Farmer John is free to select different subsets of machines to operate on different days.\n\nFarmer John is interested in computing the maximum amount of milk he can extract over a series of D days (1 <= D <= 50,000).  At the beginning of each day, he has enough time to perform maintenance on one selected milking machine i, thereby changing its daily milk output M(i) from that day forward. Given a list of these daily modifications, please tell Farmer John how much milk he can produce over D days (note that this number might not fit into a 32-bit integer).\n\nFJ\u6700\u8fd1\u4e70\u4e861\u4e2a\u65b0\u4ed3\u5e93, \u5185\u542bN \u4e2a\u6324\u5976\u673a,1 \u5230N \u7f16\u53f7\u5e76\u6392\u6210\u4e00\u884c\u3002\n\n\n\u6324\u5976\u673ai \u6bcf\u5929\u80fd\u4ea7\u51faM(i) \u5355\u4f4d\u7684\u5976\u3002\u4e0d\u5e78\u7684\u662f, \u673a\u5668\u88c5\u5f97\u592a\u8fd1\u4ee5\u81f3\u4e8e\u5982\u679c\u4e00\u53f0\u673a\u5668i \u5728\u67d0\u5929\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528, \u90a3\u4e0e\u5b83\u76f8\u90bb\u7684\u4e24\u53f0\u673a\u5668\u90a3\u4e00\u5929\u4e0d\u80fd\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\n\n\n(\u5f53\u7136, \u4e24\u7aef\u70b9\u5904\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5206\u522b\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u4e4b\u76f8\u90bb\u7684\u673a\u5668)\u3002\n\n\nFJ \u53ef\u81ea\u7531\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65e5\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\n\n\nFJ\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728D \u5929\u5185\u4ed6\u80fd\u4ea7\u51fa\u5976\u7684\u6700\u5927\u503c\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u5929\u5f00\u59cb\u65f6, \u4ed6\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e00\u4e2a\u9009\u4e2d\u7684\u6324\u5976\u673ai, \u4ece\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u5b83\u4ece\u90a3\u5929\u8d77\u7684\u6bcf\u65e5\u4ea7\u5976\u91cfM(i)\u3002\n\n\n\u7ed9\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6bcf\u65e5\u7684\u4fee\u6539,\u8bf7\u544a\u8bc9FJ\u4ed6D \u5929\u4e2d\u80fd\u4ea7\u591a\u5c11\u5976\u3002\n",
