    "description": "The cows have set up a telephone network, which for the purposes of this problem can be considered to be an unrooted tree of unspecified degree with N (1 <= N <= 100,000) vertices conveniently numbered 1..N. Each vertex represents a telephone switchboard, and each edge represents a telephone wire between two switchboards. Edge i is specified by two integers A\\_i and B\\_i the are the two vertices joined by edge i (1 <= A\\_i <= N; 1 <= B\\_i <= N; A\\_i != B\\_i).\n\nSome switchboards have only one telephone wire connecting them to another switchboard; these are the leaves of the tree, each of which is a telephone booth located in a cow field.\n\nFor two cows to communicate, their conversation passes along the unique shortest path between the two vertices where the cows are located. A switchboard can accomodate only up to K (1 <= K <= 10) simultaneous conversations, and there can be at most one conversation going through a given wire at any one time.\n\nGiven that there is a cow at each leaf of the tree, what is the maximum number of pairs of cows that can simultaneously hold\n\nconversations? A cow can, of course, participate in at most one conversation.\n\n```cpp\n1   5          C1   C5 \n|   |          ||   || \n2---4   -->    |2---4| \n|   |          ||   || \n3   6          C3   C6 \n```\nConsider this six-node telephone tree with K=1: \n\nThere are four cows, located at vertices 1, 3, 5 and 6. If cow 1 talks to cow 3, and cow 5 talks to cow 6, then they do not exceed the maximum number of conversations per switchboard, so for this example the answer is 2 (for two pairs of cows talking simultaneously). \n\n\u5976\u725b\u4eec\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7535\u8bdd\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u6839\u6811\uff08\u5927\u6982\u662f\u4e2a\u56fe\u5427\u3002\u3002\u3002\uff09\uff0c\u91cc\u9762N (1 <= N <= 100,000)\u4e2a\u7ed3\u70b9\u53ef\u4ee5\u7b80\u4fbf\u7684\u7f16\u53f7\u4e3a1...N\u3002\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u70b9\u4ee3\u8868\u4e00\u4e2a\u7535\u8bdd\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5f00\u5173\uff09\uff0c\u6bcf\u6761\u8fb9\u4ee3\u8868\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u63a5\u4e24\u4e2a\u7535\u8bdd\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u7684\u7535\u8bdd\u7ebf\u3002\u8fb9i\u662f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u6574\u6570A\\_i\u548cB\\_i\u8868\u793a\u7684\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8be5\u8fb9\u8fde\u63a5\u7740A\\_i\u548cB\\_i\u4e24\u4e2a\u7535\u8bdd\u4ea4\u6362\u673a(1 <= A\\_i <= N; 1 <= B\\_i <= N; A\\_i != B\\_i).\n\n\u4e00\u4e9b\u7535\u8bdd\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u6839\u7535\u8bdd\u7ebf\uff1b\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u8fd9\u68f5\u6811\u7684\u53f6\u5b50\u7ed3\u70b9\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53f6\u5b50\u7ed3\u70b9\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u53ea\u725b\u3002\u5f53\u4e24\u5934\u725b\u5728\u901a\u8bdd\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6cbf\u7740\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u5728\u4e24\u5934\u725b\u6240\u5728\u7ed3\u70b9\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u3002\n\n\u4e00\u4e2a\u7535\u8bdd\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u53ea\u80fd\u5fd9\u4e8eK(1 <= K <= 10)\u4e2a\u540c\u65f6\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7535\u8bdd\u7ebf\u540c\u4e00\u65f6\u95f4\u53ea\u80fd\u4f20\u9001\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3002\n\n\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53f6\u5b50\u7ed3\u70b9\u90fd\u6709\u4e00\u5934\u725b\u7684\u6811\uff0c \u95ee\u6700\u591a\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u5bf9\u5976\u725b\u80fd\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff1f\n",
