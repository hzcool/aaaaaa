    "description": "There are $n$ cards arranged on a table in a certain order.\n\nTwo integers are written on each card, one per side: the obverse and the reverse.\n\nInitially all cards lie with the averse facing up.\n\nByteasar, The Great Illusionist, intends to perform (multiple times!) his signature    Binary Search Card Manipulation.  However, to present it, he needs the sequence of numbers    as seen on the cards to be non-decreasing.\n\nThus, Byteasar may have to turn over some cards so that the numbers on their reverse sides    become visible.\n\nFurthermore, the illusion requires a participant from the audience.\n\nAlas, some of the volunteers are deployed by Byteasar's competitors who want him to fail.\n\nEach such supposititious volunteer, upon entering the scene, would swap two cards on the table in a lightning move of a hand.  After each such swap, Byteasar can again turn over any cards he desires but nevertheless, he may not be able to perform his great illusion.\n\nIf that were to happen, he would be forced to turn to traditional illusions, such as pulling a rabbit out of a hat.\n\nWrite a program that determines, after each card swap, if Byteasar can perform his great illusion.\n\n\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u5361\u724c\uff0c\u6b63\u53cd\u5404\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u4efb\u610f\u7ffb\u8f6c\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f1a\u5c06\u4e24\u5f20\u5361\u724c\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8c03\u6362\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\u540e\u56de\u7b54\u4ee5\u73b0\u5728\u7684\u5361\u724c\u987a\u5e8f\u80fd\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u8f6c\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u8c03\u4e0d\u964d\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\n",
