    "description": "Mirko has become CEO of a huge corporation. This corporation consists of \u200bN people,\nlabeled from 1 to \u200bN\n, and Mirko is labeled 1. The corporation is structured so that each\nemployee (except Mirko) has a boss, and we say that employee is an assistant to that boss.\nEach boss can have multiple assistants, but still reports to their boss. This holds for\neveryone except Mirko, who is at the top of the pyramid and doesn\u2019t have a boss, but has his\nassistants.\n\nWhen Mirko gets a task from the investors, he then delegates that task to his assistant with\nthe minimal number. This assistant then delegates the task to their assistant with the\nminimal number, and this process repeats until the task is given to an unlucky person\nwithout an assistant, who then must do the task.\n\nThis is when the real problems begin. The person that did the task gets paid 1 coin, the boss\nof that person gets 2 coins, the boss of that person gets 3 coins, and so on, all the way to\nMirko, who gets as many coins as there are people in this sequence. After that, the\nemployee that really did the job realizes how unfair the system is and quits their job out of\nprinciple.\n\nWhen it comes to doing the next task in the corporation, there is a person less, so maybe the\npaychecks are less, but the work must continue. Tasks are piling up, so the whole procedure\n(assigning a new task, doing it, dividing paychecks and the person doing the task quitting)\nrepeats until Mirko is left alone in the corporation and does his first (also his last) task.\n\nOf course, Mirko will have amassed quite a fortune until then, but he also wants to know how\nmuch money each of the employees earned.",

For\nthis, employee 3 gets 1 coin, employee 2 gets 2 coins, and employee 1 (Mirko) gets 3 coins.\nEmployee 3 then quits.\n\nMirko assigns the second task to employee 2, who then assigns it to employee 4 (because employee\n3 quit), who then assigns it to employee 5, who then does it. For this, employee 5 gets 1 coin,\nemployee 4 gets 2 coins, employee 2 gets 3 coins, and employee 1 gets 4 coins. Employee 5 then quits.\n\nThe procedure is repeated for a total of 5 tasks.\n\nIn total, Mirko gets 13 coins, employee 2 gets 8, employee 4 gets 3, and employee 3 and 5 each get 1\ncoin.",
