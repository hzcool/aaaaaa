    "description": "Just like humans, cows often appreciate feeling they are unique in some way. Since Farmer John's cows all come from the same breed and look quite similar, they want to measure uniqueness in their names.\n\nEach cow's name has some number of substrings. For example, \"amy\" has substrings {a, m, y, am, my, amy}, and \"tommy\" would have the following substrings: {t, o, m, y, to, om, mm, my, tom, omm, mmy, tomm, ommy, tommy}.\n\n\nA cow name has a \"uniqueness factor\" which is the number of substrings of that name not shared with any other cow. For example, If amy was in a herd by herself, her uniqueness factor would be 6. If tommy was in a herd by himself, his uniqueness factor would be 14. If they were in a herd together, however, amy's uniqueness factor would be 3 and tommy's would be 11.\n\n\nGiven a herd of cows, please determine each cow's uniqueness factor.\n\n\n\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u300c\u72ec\u7279\u503c\u300d\u4e3a\u53ea\u5c5e\u4e8e\u8be5\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u975e\u7a7a\u5b50\u4e32\u7684\u4e2a\u6570\u3002\u5982 \"amy\" \u4e0e \u201ctommy\u201d \u4e24\u4e2a\u4e32\uff0c\u53ea\u5c5e\u4e8e \"amy\" \u7684\u672c\u8d28\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b50\u4e32\u4e3a \"a\" \"am\" \"amy\" \u5171 3 \u4e2a\u3002\u53ea\u5c5e\u4e8e \"tommy\" \u7684\u672c\u8d28\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b50\u4e32\u4e3a \"t\" \"to\" \"tom\" \"tomm\" \"tommy\" \"o\" \"om\" \"omm\" \"ommy\" \"mm\" \"mmy\" \u5171 11 \u4e2a\u3002 \u6240\u4ee5 \"amy\" \u7684\u300c\u72ec\u7279\u503c\u300d\u4e3a 3 \uff0c\"tommy\" \u7684\u300c\u72ec\u7279\u503c\u300d\u4e3a 11 \u3002\n\n\u7ed9\u5b9a N ($N \\leq 10^5$) \u4e2a\u5b57\u7b26\u96c6\u4e3a\u5c0f\u5199\u82f1\u6587\u5b57\u6bcd\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u5c0f\u4e8e $10^5$\uff0c\u6c42\u51fa\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u300c\u72ec\u7279\u503c\u300d\u3002\n",
