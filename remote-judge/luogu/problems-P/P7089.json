    "description": "Kevin resembles his class in primary school. There were girls and boys in his class. Some of them were friends, some were not. But if one person considered another person a friend, the opposite was also true.\n\nInterestingly, every girl had exactly a friends among girls and exactly $b$ friends among boys, whereas every boy had exactly $c$ friends among girls and exactly $d$ friends among boys.\n\nKevin does not remember the size of his class. Help him reconstruct the class with minimal possible number of kids, such that the above conditions are satisfied.",
