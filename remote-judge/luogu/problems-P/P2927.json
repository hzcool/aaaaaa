    "description": "The cows have taken up alphabetical jigsaw puzzles. In these puzzles with R (1 <= R <= 10) rows and C (1 <= C <= 10) columns, the edges are not funny-shaped cardboard shapes but rather are letters.\n\nEach piece has a serial number and 4 letters (or borders) that must be aligned as in a regular jigsaw puzzle. The pseudo-letter '0' (the digit 0) will represent a border (and a piece can have several borders if it is a corner piece or even the top of column in a, e.g., 4x1 puzzle).  Below is a set of six pieces (the borders are marked with lines instead of '0's) assembled in one way (of many) that completes the puzzle:\n\n+---+  +---+  +---+\n\n| 1 c  c 3 d  d 5 | \n+-d-+  + a +  +-e-+\n\n+-d-+  +-a-+  +-e-+\n\n| 2 b  b 4 b  b 6 | \n+---+  +---+  +---+\n\nNote that each edge letter of each piece matches the border letter of the piece adjacent to it; the borders appear properly on the top, bottom, and sides.\n\nPieces are represented by a serial number and a clockwise list of their four edges (where edges are the letters a..z and 0). Pieces might require rotation when placed in the puzzle.\n\nGiven a set of pieces, find at least one way to assemble them into a puzzle. Test data for puzzles with larger R and C are easier to solve because they have a more varied set of edge letters.\n\n\u5976\u725b\u4eec\u5728\u73a9\u6309\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u987a\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u7684\u62fc\u56fe\u8c1c\u9898.\u6bcf\u9053\u8c1c\u9898\u6709R(1\u2264R\u226410)\u5217C(1\u2264C\u226410)\u884c\u7684\u62fc\u56fe\u5757,\u5b83\u4eec\u8fb9\u7f18\u662f\u7531\u5b57\u6bcd\u6216\u5c01\u95ed\u8fb9\u754c\u7ec4\u6210,\u5b8c\u6210\u540e\u7684\u6574\u526f\u62fc\u56fe\u5916\u56f4\u662f\u8fb9\u754c\u7ebf,\u4e2d\u95f4\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u662f\u5b57\u6bcd.\n\n\u6bcf\u5757\u62fc\u56fe\u5757\u90fd\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u53f7\u548c4\u4e2a\u5b57\u6bcd\u6216\u8005\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u793a\u8fb9\u754c\u7ebf(\u987a\u5e8f\u4e3a\u4e0a\u53f3\u4e0b\u5de6),\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d,\u6570\u5b57\u5145\u5f53\u8fb9\u754c\u7ebf.\n\n\u62fc\u56fe\u53ef\u4ee5\u6362\u4f4d\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c,\u5b8c\u6210\u540e\u7684\u62fc\u56fe\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u7684\u5757\u4e0a\u9760\u8fd1\u5916\u56f4\u7684\u662f\u8fb9\u754c\u7ebf,\u62fc\u56fe\u5b8c\u6210\u540e,\u4e00\u5757\u62fc\u56fe\u82e5\u4e0e\u53e6\u4e00\u5757\u76f8\u90bb,\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u5b57\u6bcd\u5fc5\u987b\u76f8\u540c,\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u62fc\u56fe\u8c1c\u9898\u51716\u5757.\n",
