    "description": "\n\nLittle Petya likes integers. Recently he has learned about different properties of sums of number's digits. For example, if the sum of number's digits is divisible by $9$ , then the number itself is divisible by $9$ as well.\n\nNow little Petya is interested in numbers with equal sum of digits. He asks his older brother Dima to find $n$ positive integers with equal sum of digits and minimal possible total sum. Dima has other important things to do, so he asked you to write a program that solves this problem for him.\n\n",
