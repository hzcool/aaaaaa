    "description": "Young Bytensson loves to hang out in the port tavern, where he often    listens to the sea dogs telling their tales of seafaring.\n\nInitially, he believed them all, however incredible they sounded.\n\nOver time though, he became suspicious.\n\nHe has decided to write a program that will verify if there may be    any grain of truth in those tall stories.\n\nBytensson reasoned that while he cannot tell if the sailors indeed    weathered all those storms, he can at least find out if their travel    itineraries make sense.\n\nThis is a task for a programmer, which Bytensson, unfortunately, is not.\n\nHelp him out!\n\nThere are $n$ ports and $m$ waterways connecting them in the waters    frequented by the sailors Bytensson listened to.\n\nIf there is a waterway between two ports, then sailing from one to the    other is possible.  Any waterway can be sailed in both    directions.\n\nBytensson got to know $k$ seafaring tales.\n\nEach tells of a sailor who began his journey in one port,    sailed a number of waterways, and ended up in another port,    which may have been the one he initially set sail from.\n\nThe sailor in question may have sailed through the same waterway    many times, each time in any direction.\n\n\u7ed9n\u4e2a\u70b9m\u6761\u8fb9\u65e0\u5411\u56fe\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u8be2\u95ee\u4e24\u4e2a\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u662f\u5426\u6709\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3ad\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff08\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u8def\u5f84\uff09\n",
