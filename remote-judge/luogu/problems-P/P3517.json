    "description": "We call any sequence of points in the plane a plot.\n\nWe intend to replace a given plot $(P_1,\\cdots,P_n)$ with another that will    have at most $m$ points ($m\\le n$) in such a way that it \"resembles\" the    original plot best.\n\nThe new plot is created as follows. The sequence of points $P_1,\\cdots,P_n$ can be partitioned into $s$ ($s\\le m$) contiguous subsequences:\n\n$(P_{k_0+1},\\cdots,P_{k_1}),(P_{k_1+1},\\cdots,P_{k_2}),\\cdots,(P_{k_{s-1}+1},\\cdots,P_{k_s})$ where $0=k_0<k_1<k_2<\\cdots<k_s=n$,and afterwards each subsequence $(P_{k_{i-1}+1},\\cdots,P_{k_i})$, for $i=1,\\cdots,s$,is replaced by a new point $Q_i$.\n\nIn that case we say that each of the points $P_{k_{i-1}+1},\\cdots,P_{k_i}$ has been contracted to the point $Q_i$.\n\nAs a result a new plot, represented by the points $Q_1,\\cdots,Q_s$, is created.\n\nThe measure of such plot's resemblance to the original is the maximum distance of all the points $P_1,\\cdots,P_n$ to the point it has been contracted to:\n\n$max_{i=1,\\cdots,s}(max_{j=k_{i-1}+1,\\cdots,k_i}(d(P_j,Q_i)))$    where $d(P_j,Q_i)$ denotes the distance between $P_j$ and $Q_i$, given by the well-known formula:\n\n$d((x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2))=\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$\n\n ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/pic/6975.png) \n\nAn exemplary plot $P_1,\\cdots,P_7$ and the new plot $(Q_1,Q_2)$, where $(P_1,\\cdots,P_4)$ are contracted to $Q_1$, whereas $(P_5,P_6,P_7)$ to $Q_2$.\n\nFor a given plot consisting of $n$ points, you are to find the plot that    resembles it most while having at most $m$ points,    where the partitioning into contiguous subsequences is arbitrary.\n\nDue to limited precision of floating point operations, a result is deemed    correct if its resemblance to the given plot is larger than the optimum    resemblance by at most $0.000001$.\n\n\u7ed9\u5b9an\u4e2a\u70b9\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u628an\u4e2a\u70b9\u5206\u6210\u4e0d\u591a\u4e8em\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6c42\u51fa\u6bcf\u6bb5\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u8986\u76d6\u5706\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u540e\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u6700\u5c0f\u3002\n\n\n",
