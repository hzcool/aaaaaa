    "description": "Farmer John has forgotten to repair a hole in the fence on his farm, and his N cows (1 <= N <= 1,000) have escaped and gone on a rampage! Each minute a cow is outside the fence, she causes one dollar worth of damage. FJ must visit each cow to install a halter that will calm the cow and stop the damage.\n\nFortunately, the cows are positioned at distinct locations along a straight line on a road outside the farm. FJ knows the location P\\_i of each cow i (-500,000 <= P\\_i <= 500,000, P\\_i != 0) relative to the gate (position 0) where FJ starts.\n\nFJ moves at one unit of distance per minute and can install a halter instantly. Please determine the order that FJ should visit the cows so he can minimize the total cost of the damage; you should compute the minimum total damage cost in this case.\n\n\u519c\u592b\u7ea6\u7ff0\u7684\u7267\u573a\u56f4\u680f\u4e0a\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d1e\uff0c\u6709N(1 <= N <= 1,000)\u53ea\u725b\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6d1e\u9003\u51fa\u4e86\u7267\u573a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51fa\u9003\u7684\u5976\u725b\u5f88\u72c2\u8e81\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u5916\u9762\u5230\u5904\u641e\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u6bcf\u5206\u949f\u6bcf\u5934\u725b\u90fd\u4f1a\u7ed9\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5e26\u67651\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u635f\u5931\u3002\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5fc5\u987b\u7528\u7f30\u7ef3\u5957\u4f4f\u6240\u6709\u7684\u725b\uff0c\u4ee5\u505c\u6b62\u4ed6\u4eec\u641e\u7834\u574f\u3002\n\n\n\u5e78\u8fd0\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5976\u725b\u4eec\u90fd\u5728\u7267\u573a\u5916\u4e00\u6761\u7b14\u76f4\u7684\u516c\u8def\u4e0a\uff0c\u7267\u573a\u7684\u5927\u95e8\u6070\u597d\u4f4d\u4e8e\u516c\u91cc\u76840\u70b9\u5904\u3002\u7ea6\u7ff0\u77e5\u9053\u6bcf\u5934\u725b\u8ddd\u79bb\u7267\u573a\u5927\u95e8\u7684\u8ddd\u79bbP\\_i(-500,000 <= P\\_i <= 500,000, P\\_i != 0)\n\n\n\u7ea6\u7ff0\u4ece\u519c\u573a\u5927\u95e8\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u6bcf\u5206\u949f\u79fb\u52a8\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u6bcf\u5230\u4e00\u5934\u725b\u6240\u5728\u7684\u5730\u70b9\uff0c\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5c31\u4f1a\u7ed9\u5b83\u5957\u4e0a\u7f30\u7ef3\uff0c\u5957\u7f30\u7ef3\u4e0d\u82b1\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u6309\u600e\u6837\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u53bb\u7ed9\u725b\u5957\u7f30\u7ef3\u624d\u80fd\u4f7f\u7ea6\u7ff0\u635f\u5931\u7684\u8d39\u7528\u6700\u5c11\uff1f\n",
