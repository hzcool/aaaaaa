    "description": "It is Advent season. There are M street lights in a street N metres long (the meters of the\nstreet are denoted with numbers from 1 to N). Each of the lights lights up the meter of the\nstreet it\u2019s located in and K meters to the left and to the right of that location. In other words, if\nthe light is located at meter X, it lights up all metres of the street from X - K to X + K,\ninclusively. Of course, it is possible for a meter of the street to be lit up by multiple street\nlights. All lights have distinct locations.\n\nThe problem is that there is a possibility that the lights don\u2019t light up all N metres of the\nstreet. It is your task to determine the minimal amount of additional lights needed to be put\nup (at position from 1 to N) so that the entire street is lit up.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains the number N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000).\n\nThe second line of input contains the number M (1 \u2264 M \u2264 N).\n\nThe third line contains the number K (0 \u2264 K \u2264 N).\n\nEach of the following M lines contains a number. The numbers are sorted in ascending order\nand represent the positions of each of the M street lights.\n\nThe positions will be distinct and from the interval [1, N].\n",
    "outputFormat": "You must output the required number from the task.",

    ],
    "hint": "**Clarification of the first test case:**\n\nIt\u2019s not necessary to add lights to the street, since all N meters are already lit up.\n\n**Clarification of the third test case:**\n\nIt is necessary to add one lamp, for example at location 13."
