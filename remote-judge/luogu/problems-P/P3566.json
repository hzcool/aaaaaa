    "description": "Little Bitie and his friends spent the whole yesterday playing    with colorful bricks in the kindergarten.\n\nInitially they made building models but they quickly got bored with that.\n\nThen they decided to place the bricks in a line, one after another.\n\nTo avoid a dull look, they tried to avoid putting two bricks of the same    color next to each other.\n\nAfter a long while they succeeded in placing all the bricks while observing    this rule.\n\nThen the day care was over, and the children went home with their parents.\n\nToday Bitie came to the kindergarten early.\n\nHe was satisfied to see that their yesterday's creation was still standing.\n\nBut then he tripped over in a most unfortunate way,    falling right on the line of bricks, which all mixed in a pile.\n\nThe boy quickly sorted them by color and wondered how best to quickly    reassemble the perfect line.\n\nHe managed to recall what were the colors of the two bricks on both end of the line.\n\nHelp little Bitie out and tell him how to order the bricks in a line so that    no two bricks of the same color are next to each other and the bricks at the ends    of the line have the colors that he recalled.\n\nNote that Bitie could have made a mistake in recalling the two colors    or perhaps he did not find some of the blocks after falling into them,    so the reconstruction might not be possible.\n\n\u7ed9\u4f60\u6bcf\u79cd\u989c\u8272\u7684\u7816\u5757\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u76f8\u540c\u989c\u8272\u7684\u7816\u5757\u4e0d\u80fd\u653e\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u4e24\u5934\u989c\u8272\u5df2\u7ecf\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6848\n",
