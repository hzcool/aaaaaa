    "description": "We are given a sequence of n decimal digits. The sequence needs to be partitioned into one or more contiguous subsequences such that each subsequence, when interpreted as a decimal number, is divisible by a given integer m. \n\nFind the number of different such partitions modulo $10^9 +7$. When determining if two partitions are different, we only consider the locations of subsequence boundaries rather than the digits themselves, e.g. partitions $2|22$ and $22|2$ are considered different.",
    "inputFormat": "The \ufb01rst line contains two integers n and m (1\u2264n\u2264300000, 1\u2264m\u22641000000) \u2013 the length of the sequence and the divisor respectively. The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n digits.",
    "outputFormat": "Output a single integer \u2013 the number of different partitions modulo 109 +7.",
