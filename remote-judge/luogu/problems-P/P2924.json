    "description": "Farmer John has purchased N (5 <= N <= 250) fence posts in order to build a very nice-looking fence. Everyone knows the best fences are convex polygons where fence posts form vertices of a polygon. The pasture is represented as a rectilinear grid; fencepost i is at integer coordinates (x\\_i, y\\_i) (1 <= x\\_i <= 1,000; 1 <= y\\_i <= 1000).\n\nGiven the locations of N fence posts (which, intriguingly, feature no set of three points which are collinear), what is the largest number of fence posts FJ can use to create a fence that is convex?\n\nFor test cases worth 45% of the points for this problem, N <= 65.\n\nTime limit: 1.2 seconds\n\nPOINTS: 400\n\nFarmer John\u7684\u519c\u573a\u91cc\u6709N\uff085<=N<=250\uff09\u4e2a\u7bf1\u7b06\u6869\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u90fd\u6709\u72ec\u4e00\u65e0\u4e8c\u7684\u5750\u6807(xi,yi)\uff081<=xi,yi<=1000\uff09\u3002\u4ed6\u60f3\u9009\u62e9\u5c3d\u91cf\u591a\u7684\u7bf1\u7b06\u6869\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4ed6\u7684\u56f4\u680f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56f4\u680f\u8981\u7f8e\u89c2\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5fc5\u987b\u662f\u51f8\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u7684\u3002\u90a3\u4ed6\u6700\u591a\u80fd\u9009\u591a\u5c11\u4e2a\u5462\uff1f\n\n\u6240\u6709\u7684\u7bf1\u7b06\u6869\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u70b9\u5171\u7ebf\u3002\n",
