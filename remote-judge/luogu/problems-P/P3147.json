    "description": "Bessie likes downloading games to play on her cell phone, even though she  doesfind the small touch screen rather cumbersome to use with her large hooves.\n\n\nShe is particularly intrigued by the current game she is playing.The game starts with a sequence of $N$ positive integers ($2 \\leq N\\leq 262,144$), each in the range $1 \\ldots 40$.  In one move, Bessiecan take two adjacent numbers with equal values and replace them asingle number of value one greater (e.g., she might replace twoadjacent 7s with an 8). The goal is to maximize the value of thelargest number present in the sequence at the end of the game.  Pleasehelp Bessie score as highly as possible!\n\nBessie\u559c\u6b22\u5728\u624b\u673a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\uff08\u2026\u2026\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u5979\u8e44\u5b50\u592a\u5927\uff0c\u5f88\u96be\u5728\u5c0f\u5c0f\u7684\u624b\u673a\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\u9762\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\n\n\n\u5979\u88ab\u5979\u6700\u8fd1\u73a9\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u8ff7\u4f4f\u4e86\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u6709n\u4e2a\u6b63\u6574\u6570\uff0c(2<=n<=262144)\uff0c\u8303\u56f4\u57281-40\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u6b65\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d1d\u897f\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u76f8\u90bb\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6570\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5408\u5e76\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u6bd4\u539f\u6765\u7684\u5927\u4e00\u7684\u6570\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u4e24\u4e2a7\u5408\u5e76\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a8)\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u4f7f\u5f97\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6570\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u8bf7\u5e2e\u52a9Bessie\u6765\u6c42\u6700\u5927\u503c\u3002\n",
