    "description": "In the Byteotian Training Centre, the pilots prepare for missions requiring extraordinary precision and control.\n\nOne measure of a pilot's capability is the duration he is able to fly along a desired route without deviating too much -    simply put, whether he can fly steadily. This is not an easy task, as the simulator is so sensitive that it registers    even a slightest move of the yoke1.\n\nAt each moment the simulator stores a single parameter describing the yoke's position.\n\nBefore each training session a certain tolerance level ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/pil-en-tex.1.png) is set.\n\nThe pilots' task then is to fly as long as they can in such a way that all the yoke's position measured during the    flight differ by at most ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/pil-en-tex.2.png). In other words, a fragment of the flight starting at time ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/pil-en-tex.3.png) and ending at time ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/pil-en-tex.4.png)    is within tolerance level ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/pil-en-tex.5.png) if the position measurements, starting with ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/pil-en-tex.6.png)-th and ending with ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/pil-en-tex.7.png)-th,    form such a sequence ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/pil-en-tex.8.png) that for all elements ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/pil-en-tex.9.png) of this sequence, the inequality ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/pil-en-tex.10.png) holds.\n\nYour task is to write a program that, given a number ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/pil-en-tex.11.png) and the sequence of yoke's position measurements,    determines the length of the longest fragment of the flight that is within the tolerance level ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/pil-en-tex.12.png).\n\n\u7ed9\u5b9an,k\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3an\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6c42\u6700\u957f\u7684\u6700\u5927\u503c\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u76f8\u5dee\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc7k\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\n",
