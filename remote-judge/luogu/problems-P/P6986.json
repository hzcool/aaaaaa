    "description": "\n\nTwo friends Albert and Barney came to the newly opened restaurant `Burrito King`. The restaurant had opened just yesterday, and Albert has got a special gift card, which allows the friends to get a free burrito. However, there is a constraint on the amount of ingredients -- the burrito can contain at most $g_i$ grams of ingredient $\\(i\\)$ for all $\\(i\\)$ from $1$ to $\\(n\\).$\n\nThere are two satisfaction parameters $\\(a_i\\)$ and $\\(b_i\\)$ for each ingredient -- the amount of Albert's joy per gram of the corresponding ingredient, and the amount of Barney's unhappiness per gram, correspondingly.\n\nTherefore, the total Albert's joy from the burrito is equal to:\n\n$\\[\\su_m_{i=1}^{n}{s_i \\cdot a_i}\\]$\n\nThe total Barney's unhappiness from the burrito is equal to:\n\n$\\[\\su_m_{i=1}^{n}{s_i \\cdot b_i}\\]$\n\nHere $\\(s_i\\)$ is the number of grams of the $\\(i\\)-th$ ingredient in the burrito. Note, that $\\(s_i\\)$ is not necessarily an integer, and $0 \\le \\(s_i\\) \\le \\(g_i\\).$\n\nAlbert wants to make his total joy from the burrito to be at least $\\(A\\).$ Barney is his best friend, so Albert wants Barney's total unhappiness to be no more than $\\(B\\).$ Among all possible burritos that satisfy the above constrains, Albert wants to choose one that maximises his total joy.\n\nYour task is to help Albert to choose $\\(s_i\\)$ to satisfy these conditions or to find out that there is no solution.\n\n",
    "inputFormat": "\n\nThe first line contains three integers $\\(n\\), \\(A\\),$ and $\\(B\\) (1 \\le \\(n\\) \\le 100 000 , 0 \\le \\(A\\), \\(B\\) \\le 10^{9}),$ the number of ingredients, the least amount of Albert's joy and the maximal amount of Barney's unhappiness. Each of the following $\\(n\\)$ lines contains a description of an ingredient: three integers $\\(g_i\\), \\(a_i\\), \\(b_i\\) (0 \\le \\(g_i\\), \\(a_i\\), \\(b_i\\) \\le 100)$ -- the maximal number of grams allowed, the amount of Albert's joy per gram and the amount of Barney's unhappiness per gram.\n\n",
