Did you crack my evil code?\n\nI did. Three days ago, you robbed a bank on $5$ Sunflower Street, the next day you blew up $25$ Sunflower Street, and yesterday you left quite a mess under number $125$ . These are all powers of $5$ . And last year you pulled a similar stunt with powers of $13$ . You seem to have a knack for Fibonacci numbers, Rabbit-Man. \n\nThat's not over! $I$ will learn... arithmetics! - Rabbit-Man screamed as he was dragged into custody - You will never know what to expect... Owww! Not my ears, you morons!\n\nMaybe, but right now you are being arrested.  - Captain added proudly.\n\nUnfortunately, Rabbit-Man has now indeed learned some more advanced arithmetics. To understand it, let us define the sequence $F_n$ (being not completely unlike the Fibonacci sequence):\n\n$F_{1} = 1$ ,\n\n$F_{2} = 2$ ,\n\n$F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n \\ge 3$ .\n\nRabbit-Man has combined all his previous evil ideas into one master plan. On the i-th day, he does a malicious act on the spot number $p(i)$ , defined as follows:\n\n$p(i) = a_{1}\u00b7F_{1}^{i}\u00a0+ a_{2}\u00b7F_{2}^{i}\u00a0+ \\cdots + a_{k}\u00b7F_{k}^{i}.$\n\nThe number $k$ and the integer coefficients $a_1 , \\cdots $ , ak are fixed. Captain Obvious learned $k$ , but does not know the coefficients. Given $p(1) , p(2) , \\cdots , p(k)$ , help him to determine p(k $+ 1)$ . To avoid overwhelmingly large numbers, do all the calculations modulo a fixed prime number $M$ . You may assume that $F_1 , F_2 , \\cdots , F_n$ are pairwise distinct modulo $M$ . You may also assume that there always exists a unique solution for the given input.\n\n",
