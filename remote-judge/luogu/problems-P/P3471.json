    "description": "The Trains of Colour Parade begins tomorrow in Byteotia.\n\nIntense preparations are already in progress at the station's auxiliary tracks. There are $n$ parallel tracks at the station, numbered from $1$ to $n$. The train no. $i$ occupies the $i^{th}$ track.\n\nEvery train consists of $l$ cars and each car is painted with one of 26 colours (denoted by non-capital letters of the English alphabet).\n\nWe say that two trains look the same, if their corresponding cars are painted the same colour.\n\nThroughout the parade a crane will switch places of certain pairs of cars. The real parade, however, will take place tomorrow.\n\nToday the train dispatcher, Byteasar, watched the general rehearsal    closely. He even wrote down the sequence of car swaps.\n\nByteasar particularly dislikes many trains looking the same.\n\nFor each train $p$ he would like to calculate the maximum number    of trains that at some moment look the same as the train $p$ at the very same moment.\n\n## Task\n\nWrite a programme that:\n\n- reads descriptions of the trains occupying tracks and the sequence of car swaps,\n\n- for each train determines the maximum number of trains that look the same as it at certain moment,\n\n- writes out the result.\n\n\n\u7ed9\u51fan\u4e2a\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u957f\u5ea6\u5747\u4e3alen\uff1b\n\n\u6709m\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u5c06\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b57\u7b26\u4ea4\u6362\uff1b\n\n\u6c42\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u70b9\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5b83\u6700\u591a\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4e2a\u6570\uff1b\n",

The following $n$ lines contain descriptions of the trains on successive tracks. The\n\n$k^{th}$ line consists of $l$ small letters of the English alphabet denoting the colours of successive cars of the $k^{th}$ train. Then $m$ lines describing the car swaps follow, in the order of the swaps.
