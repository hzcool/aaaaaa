    "description": "There is a planet, in a yet undiscovered part of the universe, with a country inhabited solely\nby mathematicians. In this country, there are a total of \u200bN mathematicians, and the interesting\nfact is that each mathematician lives in their own city. Is it also interesting that no two cities\nare connected with a road, because mathematicians can communicate online or by\nreviewing academic papers. Naturally, the cities are labeled with numbers from 1 to \u200bN.\n\nLife was perfect until one mathematician decided to write an academic paper on their\nsmartphone. The smartphone auto-corrected the word \u201cself-evident\u201d to \u201cPictionary\u201d and the\npaper was published as such. Soon after, the entire country discovered pictionary and\nwanted to meet up and play, so construction work on roads between cities began shortly.\n.\nThe road construction will last a total of \u200bM days, according to the following schedule: on the\nfirst day, construction is done on roads between all pairs of cities that have \u200bM as their\ngreatest common divisor. On the second day, construction is done on roads between all\npairs of cities that have \u200bM-1 as their greatest common divisor, and so on until the \u200b$M^{th}$ day\nwhen construction is done on roads between all pairs of cities that are co-prime. More\nformally, on the $i^{th}$ day, construction is done on roads between cities \u200ba and \u200bb if \u200bgcd(a, b) = $M-i+1$.\n\nSince the mathematicians are busy with construction work, they\u2019ve asked you to help them\ndetermine the minimal number of days before a given pair of mathematicians can play\npictionary together.",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains three positive integers \u200bN, M\nand \u200bQ\n(1 \u2264 \u200bN\n, \u200bQ \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 \u200bM\n\u2264 \u200bN\n), the number of cities, the number of days it takes to build the roads, and the number of\nqueries.\n\nEach of the following \u200bQ lines contains two distinct positive integers \u200bA and \u200bB\n(1 \u2264 \u200bA\n, \u200bB \u2264 \u200bN\n)\nthat denote the cities of the mathematicians who want to find out the minimal number of days\nbefore they can play pictionary together.",

Therefore the answer to the second query is 1.\n\nOn the second day, roads (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (4, 6) and (6, 8) are built. Cities 4 and 8 are now\nconnected (it is possible to get from the first to the second using city 6).\n\nOn the third day, roads between relatively prime cities are built, so cities 2 and 5 are connected.\n\n**Clarification of the second test case:**\n\nOn the second day, road (20, 15) is built, whereas on the fourth day, road (15, 9) is built. After the\nfourth day, cities 20 and 9 are connected via city 15.",
