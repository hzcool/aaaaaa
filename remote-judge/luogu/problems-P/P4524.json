Driving on road i takes $T_i$ minutes,\nand costs $C_i$ kunas (Croatian currency).\n\nTo make the arrival to the holiday destination as pleasant as possible, you want to make it\nas fast and as cheap as possible. More specifically, you are in city 1 and want to minimize\nthe product of total money spent and total time spent (overall, with all roads you drove on) in\ngetting to a city from city 1. For each city (except city 1), output the required minimal product\nor -1 if city 1 and that city aren\u2019t connected.\n",
