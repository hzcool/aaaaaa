    "description": "\n\nCompetitive programming is very popular in Byteland. In fact, every Bytelandian citizen is registered at two programming sites -- CodeCoder and TopForces. Each site maintains its own proprietary rating system. Each citizen has a unique integer rating at each site that approximates their skill. Greater rating corresponds to better skill.\n\nPeople of Byteland are naturally optimistic. Citizen A thinks that he has a chance to beat citizen B in a programming competition if there exists a sequence of Bytelandian citizens $A = P_{0}, P_{1},...,P_{k} = B$ for some $k \\ge 1$ such that for each $i (0 \\le i < k) , P_{i}$ has higher rating than $P_{i+1}$ at one or both sites.\n\nEach Bytelandian citizen wants to know how many other citizens they can possibly beat in a programming competition.\n\n",
    "inputFormat": "\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $n$ -- the number of citizens $(1 \\le n \\le 100 000)$ . $The\u00a0following n$ lines contain information about ratings. The i-th of them contains two integers $CC_{i} and\u00a0TF_{i}$ -- ratings of the i-th citizen at CodeCoder and TopForces $(1 \\le CC_{i}, TF_{i} \\le 10^{6}).$ All the ratings at each site are distinct.\n\n",
    "outputFormat": "\n\nFor each citizen $i$ output an integer $b_{i}$ -- how many other citizens they can possibly beat in a programming competition. Each $b_{i}$ should be printed in a separate line, in the order the citizens are given in the input.\n\n",
