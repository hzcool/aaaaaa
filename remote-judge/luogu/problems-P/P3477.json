    "description": "Multiset is a mathematical object similar to a set,    but each member of a multiset may have more than one membership.\n\nJust as with any set, the members of a multiset can be ordered    in many ways. We call each such ordering a permutation    of the multiset. For example, among the permutations of the    multiset{1,1,2,3,3,3,7,8}. there are {2,3,1,3,3,7,1,8}   and{8,7,3,3,3,2,1,1}.\n\nWe will say that one permutation of a given multiset is smaller    (in lexicographic order) than another permutation, if on the first    position that does not match the first permutation has a smaller    element than the other one. All permutations of a given multiset    can be numbered (starting from one) in an increasing order.\n\nTask      Write a programme that   reads the description of a permutation of a multiset and a positive          integerm from the standard input,                      determines the remainder of the rank of that permutation in the          lexicographic ordering modulo m,         writes out the result to the standard output.\n\n\u591a\u91cd\u96c6\u5408\u662f\u6570\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u5f88\u50cf\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u591a\u91cd\u96c6\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u53ef\u4ee5\u51fa\u73b0\u591a\u6b21\u3002\n\n\n\u548c\u96c6\u5408\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u591a\u91cd\u96c6\u7684\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u79cd\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u6392\u5e03\u987a\u5e8f\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u628a\u5b83\u53eb\u4f5c\u591a\u91cd\u96c6\u7684\u6392\u5217\u3002\n\n\n\u73b0\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u5b9a\u4e49\u591a\u91cd\u96c6\u7684\u67d0\u4e2a\u6392\u5217$s_i$\u6bd4\u67d0\u4e2a\u6392\u5217$s_j$\n\n\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e3a\u5b57\u5178\u5e8f\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u67d0\u4e2a\u591a\u91cd\u96c6\u7684\u6392\u5217\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u5c0f\u5230\u5927\u5f97\u6392\u8d77\u6765\u3002\n\n\n\u73b0\u5728\u7ed9\u4f60\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4e2a\u6570\u4e3an\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u96c6\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6392\u5217\u548cm\uff0c\u6c42\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6392\u5217\u7684\u6392\u540d\u53d6\u6a21m\u3002\n",
