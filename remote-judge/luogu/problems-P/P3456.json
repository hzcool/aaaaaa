    "description": "Byteasar loves trekking in the hills. During the hikes he explores all the ridges and valleys in vicinity.\n\nTherefore, in order to plan the journey and know how long it will last, he must know the number of ridgesand valleys in the area he is going to visit. And you are to help Byteasar.\n\nByteasar has provided you with a map of the area of his very next expedition. The map is in the shape ofa $n\\times n$ square. For each field $(i,j)$ belonging to the square(for $i,j\\in \\{1,\\cdots,n\\}$), its height $w_{(i,j)}$ is given.\n\nWe say two fields are adjacent if they have a common side or a common vertex (i.e. the field $(i,j)$ is adjacent to the fields $(i-1,j-1)$,$(i-1,j)$,$(i-1,j+1)$,$(i,j-1)$,$(i,j+1)$,$(i+1,j-1)$,$(i+1,j)$,$(i+1,j+1)$, provided that these fields are on the map).\n\nWe say a set of fields $S$ forms a ridge (valley) if:\n\nall the fields in $S$ have the same height,the set $S$ forms a connected part of the map (i.e. from any field in $S$ it is possible to reach any other    field in $S$ while moving only between adjacent fields and without leaving the set $S$),if $s\\in S$ and the field $s'\\notin S$ is adjacent to $s$, then $w_s>w_{s'}$(for a ridge) or $w_s<w_{s'}$ (for a valley).\n\nIn particular, if all the fields on the map have the same height, they form both a ridge and a valley.\n\nYour task is to determine the number of ridges and valleys for the landscape described by the map.\n\nTaskWrite a programme that:\n\nreads from the standard input the description of the map,        determines the number of ridges and valleys for the landscape described by this map,        writes out the outcome to the standard output.\n\n\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e00\u5f20\u5730\u52bf\u56fe\uff0c\u6c42\u5c71\u5cf0\u548c\u5c71\u8c37\u7684\u6570\u91cf\n",

Ineach of the following $n$ lines there is the description of the successive row of the map. In $(i+1)$'th line(for $i\\in \\{1,\\cdots,n\\}$) there are $n$ integers $w_{(i,1)},\\cdots,w_{(i,n)}$($0\\le w_i\\le 1\\ 000\\ 000\\ 000$), separated by single spaces.
