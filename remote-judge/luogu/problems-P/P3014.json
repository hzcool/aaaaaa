    "description": "The N (1 <= N <= 20) cows conveniently numbered 1...N are playing yet another one of their crazy games with Farmer John. The cows will arrange themselves in a line and ask Farmer John what their line number is. In return, Farmer John can give them a line number and the cows must rearrange themselves into that line.\n\nA line number is assigned by numbering all the permutations of the line in lexicographic order.\n\nConsider this example:\n\nFarmer John has 5 cows and gives them the line number of 3.\n\nThe permutations of the line in ascending lexicographic order: 1st: 1 2 3 4 5\n\n2nd: 1 2 3 5 4\n\n3rd: 1 2 4 3 5\n\nTherefore, the cows will line themselves in the cow line 1 2 4 3 5.\n\nThe cows, in return, line themselves in the configuration '1 2 5 3 4' and ask Farmer John what their line number is.\n\nContinuing with the list:\n\n4th : 1 2 4 5 3\n\n5th : 1 2 5 3 4\n\nFarmer John can see the answer here is 5\n\nFarmer John and the cows would like your help to play their game. They have K (1 <= K <= 10,000) queries that they need help with. Query i has two parts: C\\_i will be the command, which is either 'P' or 'Q'.\n\nIf C\\_i is 'P', then the second part of the query will be one integer A\\_i (1 <= A\\_i <= N!), which is a line number. This is Farmer John challenging the cows to line up in the correct cow line.\n\nIf C\\_i is 'Q', then the second part of the query will be N distinct integers B\\_ij (1 <= B\\_ij <= N). This will denote a cow line. These are the cows challenging Farmer John to find their line number.\n\nN(1<=N<=20)\u5934\u725b\uff0c\u7f16\u53f7\u4e3a1...N\uff0c\u6b63\u5728\u4e0eFJ\u73a9\u4e00\u4e2a\u75af\u72c2\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u5976\u725b\u4f1a\u6392\u6210\u4e00\u884c\uff08\u725b\u7ebf\uff09\uff0c\u95eeFJ\u6b64\u65f6\u7684\u884c\u53f7\u662f\u591a\u5c11\u3002\u4e4b\u540e\uff0cFJ\u4f1a\u7ed9\u725b\u4e00\u4e2a\u884c\u53f7\uff0c\u725b\u5fc5\u987b\u6309\u7167\u65b0\u884c\u53f7\u6392\u5217\u6210\u7ebf\u3002\n\n\n\u884c\u53f7\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u5b57\u5178\u5e8f\u5bf9\u884c\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6392\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u53f7\u6765\u5206\u914d\u7684\u3002\u6bd4\u5982\u8bf4\uff1aFJ\u67095\u5934\u725b\uff0c\u8ba9\u4ed6\u4eec\u6392\u4e3a\u884c\u53f73\uff0c\u6392\u5217\u987a\u5e8f\u4e3a\uff1a\n\n\n1\uff1a1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n2\uff1a1 2 3 5 4\n\n\n3\uff1a1 2 4 3 5\n\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u725b\u5c06\u5728\u725b\u7ebf1 2 4 3 5\u4e2d\u3002\n\n\n\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u5976\u725b\u6392\u5217\u4e3a\u201c1 2 5 3 4\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u5411FJ\u95ee\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u884c\u53f7\u3002\u7ee7\u7eed\u5217\u8868\uff1a\n\n\n4\uff1a1 2 4 5 3\n\n\n5\uff1a1 2 5 3 4\n\n\nFJ\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u5230\u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u662f5\u3002\n\n\nFJ\u548c\u5976\u725b\u5e0c\u671b\u4f60\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u73a9\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u9700\u8981K(1<=K<=10000)\u7ec4\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\uff1aC\\_i\u5c06\u662f\u201cP\u201d\u6216\u201cQ\u201d\u7684\u547d\u4ee4\u3002\n\n\n\u5982\u679cC\\_i\u662f'P'\uff0c\u5219\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u5206\u5c06\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u6570A\\_i\uff081 <= A\\_i <= N\uff01\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u884c\u53f7\u3002\u6b64\u65f6\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u56de\u7b54\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u725b\u7ebf\u3002\n\n\n\u5982\u679cC\\_i\u662f\u201cQ\u201d\uff0c\u5219\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u5206\u5c06\u662fN\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6574\u6570B\\_ij\uff081 <= B\\_ij <= N\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u4e00\u6761\u725b\u7ebf\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u8f93\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u884c\u53f7\u3002\n",
