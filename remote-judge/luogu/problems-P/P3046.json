    "description": "After taking a modern art class, Farmer John has become interested in finding geometric patterns in everything around his farm.  He carefully plots the locations of his N cows (2 <= N <= 1000), each one occupying a distinct point in the 2D plane, and he wonders how many different lines of symmetry exist for this set of points.  A line of symmetry, of course, is a line across which the points on both sides are mirror images of each-other.\n\nPlease help FJ answer this most pressing geometric question.\n\n\n",
    "inputFormat": "\\* Line 1: The single integer N.\n\n\\* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers representing the x and y coordinates of the ith cow (-10,000 <= x,y <= 10,000).\n",
