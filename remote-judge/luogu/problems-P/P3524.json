Furthermore, Byteasar is quite certain that to make it so it suffices if all invited guests  know each other.  He is currently trying to come up with a list of his friends he would like to invite.\n\nByteasar has $n$ friends, where $n$ is divisible by 3.\n\n```plain\nFortunately, most of Byteasar's friends know one another.\n```\nFurthermore, Byteasar recalls that he once attended a party where there were $\\frac{2}{3}n$ of his friends, and where everyone knew everyone else.\n\nUnfortunately, Byteasar does not quite remember anything else from that    party.\n\n\nIn particular, he has no idea which of his friends attended it.\n\nByteasar does not feel obliged to throw a huge party, but he would like to    invite at least \\frac{n}{3} of his friends.\n\n\n\nHe has no idea how to choose them, so he asks you for help.\n\n\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e00\u5f20n\u4e2a\u70b9m\u6761\u8fb9\u7684\u56fe$n\\equiv 0(mod\\ 3)$\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a$\\frac{2}{3}n$\u7684\u56e2\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u8f93\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a$\\frac{n}{3}$\u7684\u56e2\n",
