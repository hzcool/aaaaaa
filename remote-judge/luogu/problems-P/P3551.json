    "description": "Little Edna has received the take-out game as a present.\n\nTake-out is a single player game, in which the player is given a sequence of $n$ adjacent blocks, numbered from $1$ to $n$.\n\nEach block is either black or white, and there are $k$ times as many white    blocks as there are black ones.\n\nThe player's goal is to remove all the blocks by certain permissible moves.\n\nA single move consists in removing exactly $k$ white blocks and a single    black block without changing the positions of other blocks.\n\nThe move is permissible if there is no \"gap\" (a space left by    a previously taken out block) between any two blocks being removed.\n\nHelp poor little Edna in finding any sequence of permissible moves that    remove all the blocks.\n\n\u6709n\u5757\u7816\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u767d\u8272\u662f\u9ed1\u8272\u7684k\u500d\uff0c\u6c42\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d88\u9664\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\n\n\u6bcf\u6b21\u6d88\u9664k+1\u4e2a\u7816\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dk\u5757\u767d\u8272\uff0c1\u5757\u9ed1\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9k+1\u5757\u7816\u4ece\u5f00\u59cb\u5230\u7ed3\u675f\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u4e0d\u80fd\u8def\u8fc7\u5df2\u7ecf\u6d88\u9664\u8fc7\u7684\u7816\n\n\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6709\u89e3\n",

In all the tests the condition $k+1|n$ holds.\n\nIn the second line there is a string of $n$ letters b      or c.  These tell the colours of successive blocks (in Polish):\n\nb (for bia\u0142y) - white, c (for czarny)      - black.
