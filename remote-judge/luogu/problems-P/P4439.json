    "description": "The holiday season is near! Aron wants to get gifts for his friends in Zagreb, so in order to get them on time, he visited a famous toy store in London. After picking out the gifts, he went to the register and discovered that there were already N people in line. Luckily, he noticed that there were groups of people standing in line, in addition to individual customers. A group of people consists of a customer and their friends waiting for them to complete the purchase.\nThe moment when the customer is done, they and their friends leave the line.\n\nThe people considered a group are standing one behind the other and are wearing shirts of matching colour. Two adjacent groups, adjacent individuals or adjacent individual and a group, will never be wearing shirts of the same colour.\n\nWrite a program that will, given the data on the people standing in line, output which person in line Aron is.\n",
