    "description": "We need to arrange M kids in N teams. We begin by placing K kids in each team, starting\nfrom the first to the $N^{th}$\nteam. When we finish with the $N^{th}$\nteam, we switch directions and\ncontinue, placing K kids in each team, from the $(N-1)^{th}$\nto the first team, respectively. When\nwe finish with the first team, we switch directions again and continue the process from the\nsecond to the $N^{th}$\nteam, respectively, and so on until there are no kids left to distribute. For\nexample, if we have three teams, we will place K kids in teams in the following order: first\nteam, second team, third team, second team, first team, second team, etc.\n\nIf, at any points, there are less than K kids left to place in the current team, we place all the\nremaining kids in that team and end the process.\n\nOutput the number of kids in each team when the process ends.",
