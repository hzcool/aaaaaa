    "description": "Farmer John has gone to town to buy some farm supplies. Being a very efficient man, he always pays for his goods in such a way that the smallest number of coins changes hands, i.e., the number of coins he uses to pay plus the number of coins he receives in change is minimized. Help him to determine what this minimum number is.\n\nFJ wants to buy T (1 \u2264 T \u2264 10,000) cents of supplies. The currency system has N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 100) different coins, with values V1, V2, ..., VN (1 \u2264 Vi \u2264 120). Farmer John is carrying C1 coins of value V1, C2 coins of value V2, ...., and CN coins of value VN (0 \u2264 Ci \u2264 10,000). The shopkeeper has an unlimited supply of all the coins, and always makes change in the most efficient manner (although Farmer John must be sure to pay in a way that makes it possible to make the correct change).\n\n\u519c\u592bJohn\u60f3\u5230\u9547\u4e0a\u4e70\u4e9b\u8865\u7ed9\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ed6\u60f3\u4f7f\u786c\u5e01\u7684\u8f6c\u624b\u6b21\u6570\u6700\u5c11\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4ea4\u4ed8\u7684\u786c \u5e01\u6570\u4e0e\u627e\u96f6\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7684\u786c\u5e01\u6570\u6700\u5c11\u3002 \n\nJohn\u60f3\u8981\u4e70\u4ef7\u503c\u4e3aT\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\u6709N(1<=n<=100)\u79cd\u8d27\u5e01\u53c2\u4e0e\u6d41\u901a\uff0c\u9762\u503c\u5206\u522b\u4e3aV1,V2..Vn (1<=Vi<=120)\u3002John\u6709Ci\u4e2a\u9762\u503c\u4e3aVi\u7684\u786c\u5e01(0<=Ci<=10000)\u3002\n\n\u6211\u4eec\u5047\u8bbe\u5e97\u4e3b\u6709\u65e0\u9650\u591a\u7684\u786c\u5e01\uff0c \u5e76\u603b\u6309\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u627e\u96f6\u3002**\u6ce8\u610f\u65e0\u89e3\u8f93\u51fa-1\u3002**\n",
