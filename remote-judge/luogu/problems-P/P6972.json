    "description": "\n\nKevin and Kimberly have freckles on their foreheads.\n\nThey both drew their freckle pictures on sheets of paper. Each picture is a rectangle of `pixels`: every cell either has a freckle or it has no freckle.\n\nThey are jokingly proposing that when they grow up, marry, and have a child, her freckle picture is produced as a result of the following procedure:\n\nKevin's and Kimberly's pictures are moved by a parallel translation, and then in each cell a child has a freckle if and only if exactly one of the parents has a freckle in this position.\n\nNow they wonder, whether there is a parallel translation that gives their child a specific freckle picture (for example, a lightning), and what is this parallel translation.\n\n",
    "inputFormat": "\n\nThe first line contains two integers, $h_{1 }and w_{1} (1 \\le h_{1}, w_{1} \\le 1000)$ -- the height and the width of Kevin's freckle picture. Each of the next $h_{1}$ lines consists of $w_{1}$ characters $\u2018 \\times '$ and $\u2018. '.$ Character $\u2018 \\times '$ means that there is a freckle, and $\u2018. '$ that there is not.\n\nThe next lines contain Kimberly's picture in the same format. Its height and width $h_2$ and $w_2$ follow the same constraints.\n\nIt is guaranteed that Kevin and Kimberly have at least one freckle each.\n\nThe next lines contain the picture they want for their child in the same format. Its dimensions $h_{3}$ and $w_{3}$ also have the same constraints.\n\n",
    "outputFormat": "\n\nIn the first line output `YES` if the desired picture can be produced, and `NO` otherwise.\n\nIf the answer is positive, then in the second line output two integers, $x$ and $y$ , with the following meaning: if you overlay the pictures so that their upper left corners coincide, then move Kimberly's picture $x$ cells right (negative number means moving picture left) and $y$ cells down (negative number means moving picture up), and then apply the procedure described above, the resulting picture can be moved by a parallel translation to coincide with the third picture from the input file.\n\n",
