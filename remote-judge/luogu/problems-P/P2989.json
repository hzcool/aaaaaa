    "description": "Bessie is preparing her race car for the upcoming Grand Prix, but she wants to buy some extra parts to improve the car's performance. Her race car currently has mass M (1 <= M <= 1,000) and is able to push itself forward with a force of F (1 <= F <= 1,000,000). The Race Car Performance Store has N (1 <= N <= 10,000) parts\n\nconveniently numbered 1..N. Bessie can buy as many or as few parts as she wishes though the store stocks no more than one instance of each part.\n\nPart P\\_i adds force F\\_i (1 <= F\\_i <= 1,000,000) and has mass\n\nM\\_i (1 <= M\\_i <= 1,000). Newton's Second Law decrees that F =\n\nMA, where F is force, M is mass, and A is acceleration. If Bessie wants to maximize the total acceleration of her race car (and\n\nminimize the mass otherwise), which extra parts should she choose?\n\nConsider a race car with initial F=1500 and M=100. Four parts are available for enhancement:\n\ni  F\\_i  M\\_i\n\n1  250   25\n\n2  150    9\n\n3  120    5\n\n4  200    8\n\nAdding just part 2, e.g., would result in an acceleration of\n\n(1500+150)/(100+9) = 1650/109 = 15.13761. \n\nBelow is a chart of showing the acceleration for all possible \n\ncombinations of adding/not-adding the four parts (in column one, 1=part added, 0=part not added): \n\nParts   Aggregate   Aggregate\n\n1234        F           M       F/M\n\n0000      1500         100    15.0000\n\n0001      1700         108    15.7407\n\n0010      1620         105    15.4286\n\n0011      1820         113    16.1062\n\n0100      1650         109    15.1376\n\n0101      1850         117    15.8120\n\n0110      1770         114    15.5263\n\n0111      1970         122    16.1475 <-- highest F/M \n\n1000      1750         125    14.0000\n\n1001      1950         133    14.6617\n\n1010      1870         130    14.3846\n\n1011      2070         138    15.0000\n\n1100      1900         134    14.1791\n\n1101      2100         142    14.7887\n\n1110      2020         139    14.5324\n\n1111      2220         147    15.1020\n\nThus, the best additional part combination is parts 2, 3, and 4.\n",
