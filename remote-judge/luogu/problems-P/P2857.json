    "description": "Farmer John's N (1 <= N <= 1000) cows each reside in one of B (1 <= B <= 20) barns which, of course, have limited capacity. Some cows really like their current barn, and some are not so happy.\n\nFJ would like to rearrange the cows such that the cows are as equally happy as possible, even if that means all the cows hate their assigned barn.\n\n\nEach cow gives FJ the order in which she prefers the barns.  A cow's happiness with a particular assignment is her ranking of her barn. Your job is to find an assignment of cows to barns such that no barn's capacity is exceeded and the size of the range (i.e., one more than the positive difference between the the highest-ranked barn chosen and that lowest-ranked barn chosen) of barn rankings the cows give their assigned barns is as small as possible.\n\n\u6709N\u5934\u725b\uff0cB\u4e2a\u725b\u68da.\u544a\u8bc9\u4f60\u6bcf\u5934\u725b\u5fc3\u91cc\u725b\u68da\u7684\u5ea7\u6b21\uff0c\u5373\u54ea\u4e2a\u725b\u68da\u4ed6\u6700\u559c\u6b22\uff0c\u54ea\u4e2a\u7b2c2\u559c\u6b22\uff0c \u54ea\u4e2a\u7b2c3\u559c\u6b22\uff0c\u7b49\u7b49.\u4f46\u725b\u68da\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e00\u5b9a\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6bcf\u5934\u725b\u5206\u914d\u5230\u7684\u725b\u68da\u5728\u8be5\u725b\u5fc3\u4e2d\u7684\u5ea7\u6b21\u6709\u9ad8\u6709\u4f4e.\u73b0 \u5728\u6c42\u4e00\u79cd\u6700\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u914d\u725b\u5230\u725b\u68da\uff0c\u4f7f\u6240\u6709\u725b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u5c45\u725b\u68da\u7684\u5ea7\u6b21\u6700\u9ad8\u4e0e\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u8de8\u5ea6\u6700\u5c0f.\n",
