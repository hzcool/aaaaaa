    "description": "The cows are journeying north to Thunder Bay in Canada to gain cultural enrichment and enjoy a vacation on the sunny shores of Lake Superior. Bessie, ever the competent travel agent, has named the Bullmoose Hotel on famed Cumberland Street as their vacation residence. This immense hotel has N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 50,000) rooms all located on the same side of an extremely long hallway (all the better to see the lake, of course).\n\nThe cows and other visitors arrive in groups of size Di (1 \u2264 Di \u2264 N) and approach the front desk to check in. Each group i requests a set of Di contiguous rooms from Canmuu, the moose staffing the counter. He assigns them some set of consecutive room numbers r..r+Di-1 if they are available or, if no contiguous set of rooms is available, politely suggests alternate lodging. Canmuu always chooses the value of r to be the smallest possible.\n\nVisitors also depart the hotel from groups of contiguous rooms. Checkout i has the parameters Xi and Di which specify the vacating of rooms Xi ..Xi +Di-1 (1 \u2264 Xi \u2264 N-Di+1). Some (or all) of those rooms might be empty before the checkout.\n\nYour job is to assist Canmuu by processing M (1 \u2264 M < 50,000) checkin/checkout requests. The hotel is initially unoccupied.\n\n\u7b2c\u4e00\u884c\u8f93\u5165 $n,m$\uff0c$n$ \u4ee3\u8868\u6709 $n$ \u4e2a\u623f\u95f4 $(1\\leq n \\leq 50,000)$\uff0c\u7f16\u53f7\u4e3a $1 \\sim n$\uff0c\u5f00\u59cb\u90fd\u4e3a\u7a7a\u623f\uff0c$m$ \u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6709 $m$ \u884c\u64cd\u4f5c $(1\\leq m < 50,000)$\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6bcf\u884c\u5148\u8f93\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570 $i$ \uff0c\u8868\u793a\u4e00\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1a\n\n\u82e5 $i$ \u4e3a $1$\uff0c\u8868\u793a\u67e5\u8be2\u623f\u95f4\uff0c\u518d\u8f93\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570 $x$\uff0c\u8868\u793a\u5728 $1,2,...,n$ \u623f\u95f4\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3a $x$ \u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u623f\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u8fde\u7eed $x$ \u4e2a\u623f\u95f4\u4e2d\u5de6\u7aef\u7684\u623f\u95f4\u53f7\uff0c\u5c3d\u91cf\u8ba9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u623f\u95f4\u53f7\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u82e5\u627e\u4e0d\u5230\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3a $x$ \u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u623f\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa $0$\u3002\u82e5\u627e\u5f97\u5230\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9 $x$ \u4e2a\u7a7a\u623f\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f4f\u4e0a\u4eba\u3002\n\n\u82e5 $i$ \u4e3a $2$\uff0c\u8868\u793a\u9000\u623f\uff0c\u518d\u8f93\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570 $x,y$ \u4ee3\u8868\u623f\u95f4\u53f7 $x \\sim x+y-1$ \u9000\u623f\uff0c\u5373\u8ba9\u623f\u95f4\u4e3a\u7a7a\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165 $1$ \u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002",
