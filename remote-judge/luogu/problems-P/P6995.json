    "description": "\n\nThe races became more popular than ever at Pandora planet. But these races are quite unusual. There are $n$ cars participating in a race on the long straight track. Each car moves with a speed of $1$ meter per second. Track has coordinates in meters.\n\nThe car number $i$ moves between two points on the track with coordinates $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ starting at the second $0$ in the point $a_{i}.$ The car moves from $a_{i}$ to $b_{i},$ then from $b_{i}$ to $a_{i},$ then from $a_{i}$ to $b_{i}$ again, and so on.\n\nHandsome Mike wants to knock some cars out of the race using dynamite. Thus he has $m$ questions. The question number $j$ is: what is the number of cars in the coordinates between $x_{j}$ and $y_{j}$ inclusive after $t_{j}$ seconds from the start?\n\nYour task is to answer Mike's questions.\n\n",
    "inputFormat": "\n\nThe first line of the input file contains two integers $n$ and $m (1 \\le n , m \\le 1000)$ -- the number of cars in the race and the number of questions.\n\nEach of the following $n$ lines contains a description of the car: two integers $a_{i}$ and $b_{i} (0 \\le a_{i}, b_{i} \\le 10^{9}, a_{i} \u2260 b_{i})$ -- the coordinates of the two points between which the car $i$ moves.\n\nEach of the following $m$ lines contains a description of the question: three integers $x_{j} , y_{j}$ , and $t_{j} (0 \\le x_{j} \\le y_{j} \\le 10^{9}, 0 \\le t_{j} \\le 10^{9})$ -- the coordinate range and the time for the question $j$ .\n\n",
