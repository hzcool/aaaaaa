    "description": "Byteotia has been eventually touched by globalisation, and so has Byteasar the Postman, who once roamedthe country lanes amidst sleepy hamlets and who now dashes down the motorways. But it is those strolls inthe days of yore that he reminisces about with a touch of tenderness.\n\nIn the olden days $n$ Byteotian villages (numbered from $1$ to $n$) were connected by bidirectional dirt roadsin such a way, that one could reach the village number $1$ (called Bitburg) from any other village in exactlyone way. This unique route passed only through villages with number less or equal to that of the startingvillage. Furthermore, each road connected exactly two distinct villages without passing through any othervillage. The roads did not intersect outside the villages, but tunnels and viaducts were not unheard of.\n\nTime passing by, successive roads were being transformed into motorways. Byteasar remembers distinctly,  when each of the country roads so disappeared. Nowadays, there is not a single country lane left  in Byteotia - all of them have been replaced with motorways, which connect the villages into Byteotian  Megalopolis.\n\nByteasar recalls his trips with post to those villages. Each time he was beginning his journey with letters  to some distinct village in Bitburg. He asks you to calculate, for each such journey (which took place in a      specific moment of time and led from Bitburg to a specified village), how many country roads it led through.\n\nTaskWrite a programme which:\n\nreads from the standard input:\n\ndescriptions of roads that once connected Byteotian villages,    sequence of events: Byteasar's trips and the moments when respective roads were transformed    into motorways,            for each trip, calculates how many country roads Byteasar has had to walk,        writes the outcome to the standard output.\n\n\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5168\u7403\u5316\u6d6a\u6f6e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b,\u4e60\u60ef\u4e8e\u6f2b\u6b65\u5728\u6e05\u6668\u7684\u4e61\u95f4\u5c0f\u8def\u7684\u90ae\u9012\u5458Blue Mary\u4e5f\u5f00\u59cb\u9a91\u7740\u6469\u6258\u8f66\u4f20\u9012\u90ae\u4ef6\u4e86\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u5979\u7ecf\u5e38\u56de\u5fc6\u8d77\u4ee5\u524d\u5728\u4e61\u95f4\u6f2b\u6b65\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u3002\u6614\u65e5\uff0c\u4e61\u4e0b\u6709\u4f9d\u6b21\u7f16\u53f7\u4e3a1..n\u7684n\u4e2a\u5c0f\u6751\u5e84\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u6751\u5e84\u4e4b\u95f4\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u53cc\u5411\u7684\u571f\u8def\u3002\u4ece\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6751\u5e84\u90fd\u6070\u597d\u6709\u4e00\u6761\u8def\u5f84\u5230\u8fbe\u6751\u5e841\uff08\u5373\u6bd4\u7279\u5821\uff09\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6751\u5e84\uff0c\u5b83\u5230\u6bd4\u7279\u5821\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u6070\u597d\u53ea\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7f16\u53f7\u6bd4\u5b83\u7684\u7f16\u53f7\u5c0f\u7684\u6751\u5e84\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u9053\u8def\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u90fd\u4e0d\u5728\u9664\u6751\u5e84\u4ee5\u5916\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u5730\u70b9\u76f8\u9047\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u672a\u5f00\u5316\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u4ece\u6765\u6ca1\u6709\u8fc7\u9ad8\u67b6\u6865\u548c\u5730\u4e0b\u94c1\u9053\u3002\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u79fb\uff0c\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u571f\u8def\u88ab\u6539\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u516c\u8def\u3002\u81f3\u4eca\uff0cBlue Mary\u8fd8\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u8bb0\u5f97\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6761\u571f\u8def\u88ab\u6539\u9020\u4e3a\u516c\u8def\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u3002\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u8fd9\u91cc\u5df2\u7ecf\u6ca1\u6709\u571f\u8def\u4e86\u2014\u2014\u6240\u6709\u7684\u8def\u90fd\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u516c\u8def\uff0c\u800c\u6614\u65e5\u7684\u6751\u5e84\u5df2\u7ecf\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u3002 Blue Mary\u60f3\u8d77\u4e86\u5728\u6539\u9020\u671f\u95f4\u5979\u9001\u4fe1\u7684\u7ecf\u5386\u3002\u5979\u4ece\u6bd4\u7279\u5821\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53bb\u67d0\u4e2a\u6751\u5e84\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e24\u6b21\u9001\u4fe1\u7ecf\u5386\u7684\u95f4\u9694\u671f\u95f4,\u6709\u67d0\u4e9b\u571f\u8def\u88ab\u6539\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u516c\u8def.\u73b0\u5728Blue Mary\u9700\u8981\u4f60\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\uff1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u6bcf\u6b21\u9001\u4fe1\u5979\u9700\u8981\u8d70\u8fc7\u7684\u571f\u8def\u6570\u76ee\u3002\uff08\u5bf9\u4e8e\u516c\u8def\uff0c\u5979\u53ef\u4ee5\u9a91\u6469\u6258\u8f66\uff1b\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u571f\u8def\uff0c\u5979\u5c31\u53ea\u597d\u63a8\u8f66\u4e86\u3002\uff09\n",
