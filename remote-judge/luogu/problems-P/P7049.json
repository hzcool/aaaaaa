    "description": "\n\nThe jury has a great artistic idea -- to create a rectangular panel out of a huge pile of black and white squares of the same size. The panel should have exactly $b 4-connected$ areas made of black tiles, and $w 4-connected$ areas made of white tiles.\n\nRemember, a $4-connected$ area of some color is a maximal set of the panel tiles such that:\n\nany two tiles of the area share the same color;\n\nfor any two tiles of the area there is a tile sequence connecting them, such that any two consecutive tiles of the sequence share a common side.\n\nIn addition to the artistic idea, the jury has already developed a program that produces design of the panel. But since this problem is about art, any new solution is extremely important for the jury.\n\n",
    "inputFormat": "\n\nThe only line of the input file contains two integers $b$ and $w$ -- number of black and white areas $(1 \\le b , w \\le 1000)$ .\n\n",
    "outputFormat": "\n\nThe first line of the output file should contain the picture sizes $r$ and $c$ -- the number of rows and columns $(1 \\le r , c \\le 100 000)$ . This line should be followed by $r$ lines of $c$ symbols each. Each symbol should be either $\u2018@'$ (for black tile) or $\u2018. '$ (for white one). There should be no more than $100 000$ tiles in the panel.\n\n",
