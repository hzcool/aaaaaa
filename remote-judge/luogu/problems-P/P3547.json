    "description": "Railway has always been the most popular mean of transport in Byteotia.\n\nOut of $n$ towns in the land, $m$ pairs are connected by track segments    belonging to Byteotian State Railways (BSR).\n\nThe tracks do not cross outside of towns, and may lead through picturesque    bridges and somewhat less picturesque tunnels.\n\nThe ticket for travelling between any two towns    directly connected by rail costs $a$ bythalers.\n\nCurrently the transportation market in Byteotia is changing.\n\nAs of now, BSR faces a new competitor: Byteotian Airlines (BA).\n\nBA plans to operate flights between some pairs of towns.\n\nSince Byteotian railways are quite comfortable, the BA board has decided to    operate flights only between pairs of towns that are not directly    connected by rail.  Due to economy, BA will fly only between towns    for which the cheapest railway connection requires exactly one change.\n\nThe ticket for each such flight is going to cost $b$ bythalers.\n\nTo help Byteotian citizens in planning their trips, the Byteotian    Ministry for Transport (BMT) has decided to issue leaflets specifying the    cheapest routes between all possible towns.  A sequence of an    arbitrary number of direct railway or airplane connections is    called a route.  A BMT officer by the name of Byteasar has been    commissioned with the task of preparing the price list for the leaflets.\n\nCould you help him in writing a program that will determine the right    prices?\n\nLet us clarify that all the connections in Byteotia, both by railway and    airplane, are bidirectional.\n",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of the standard input contains five integers,$n$,$m$,$k$,$a$ and $b$ ($2\\le n\\le 100\\ 000$, $\\le m\\le 100\\ 000$, $1\\le k\\le n$, $1\\le a,b\\le 1\\ 000$),      separated by single spaces.\n\nThe numbers $n$ and $m$ denote the number of towns and the number of      direct railway connections in Byteotia, respectively.\n\nFor simplicity, we number the towns in Byteotia from $1$ to $n$. The other numbers denote:$k$ - the number of the source town for which the connection prices are to be determined;$a$ - the price of a direct railway connection;$b$ - the price of a direct airplane connection.\n\nEach of the following $m$ lines contains a pair of integers $u_i$ and $v_i$($1\\le u_i,v_i\\le n$,$u_i\\ne v_i$ for $i=1,2,\\cdots,m$), separated by a single space, specifying the number of towns directly connected by tracks.\n\n\nYou may assume that all towns are reachable by railway from the town no. $k$.\n",
    "outputFormat": "Your program should print $n$ lines to the standard output.\n\nThe line no. $i$ (for $i=1,2,\\cdots,n$) should contain a single integer:\n\nthe cost of the cheapest route from town no. $k$ to town no. $i$.\n\nAmong those, the line no. $k$ should contain the number $0$.\n",
