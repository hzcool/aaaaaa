    "description": "N (1 <= N <= 50,000) cows conveniently numbered 1..N are driving in separate cars along a highway in Cowtopia. Cow i can drive in any of M different high lanes (1 <= M <= N) and can travel at a maximum speed of S\\_i (1 <= S\\_i <= 1,000,000) km/hour.\n\nAfter their other bad driving experience, the cows hate collisions and take extraordinary measures to avoid them. On this highway, cow i reduces its speed by D (0 <= D <= 5,000) km/hour for each cow in front of it on the highway (though never below 0 km/hour). Thus, if there are K cows in front of cow i, the cow will travel at a speed of max[S\\_i - D \\* K, 0]. While a cow might actually travel faster than a cow directly in front of it, the cows are spaced far enough apart so crashes will not occur once cows slow down as\n\ndescribed,\n\nCowtopia has a minimum speed law which requires everyone on the highway to travel at a a minimum speed of L (1 <= L <= 1,000,000) km/hour so sometimes some of the cows will be unable to take the highway if they follow the rules above. Write a program that will find the maximum number of cows that can drive on the highway while obeying the minimum speed limit law.\n\n\u7f16\u53f7\u4e3a $1$ \u5230 $N$ \u7684 $N$ \u53ea\u5976\u725b\u6b63\u5404\u81ea\u9a7e\u7740\u8f66\u6253\u7b97\u5728\u725b\u5fb7\u6bd4\u4e9a\u7684\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u4e0a\u98de\u9a70\uff0e\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u6709 $M(1\\leq M\\leq N)$ \u6761\u8f66\u9053\uff0e\u5976\u725b $i$ \u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8f66\u901f\u4e0a\u9650$S_i(1\\leq S_i\\leq 10^6)$\uff0e\n\n\u5728\u7ecf\u5386\u8fc7\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e8b\u6545\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u5976\u725b\u4eec\u53d8\u5f97\u5341\u5206\u5c0f\u5fc3\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u53d1\u751f\uff0e\u6bcf\u6761\u8f66\u9053\u4e0a\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u67d0\u4e00\u53ea\u5976\u725b $i$ \u7684\u524d\u9762\u6709 $k$ \u53ea\u5976\u725b\u9a7e\u8f66\u884c\u9a76\uff0c\u90a3\u5976\u725b $i$ \u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u9650\u5c31\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d $k\\times D$ \u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\uff0c\u5979\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8d85\u8fc7 $S_i - k \\times D(0\\leq D\\leq 5000)$\uff0c\u5f53\u7136\u5982\u679c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6570\u662f\u8d1f\u7684\uff0c\u90a3\u5979\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u5c06\u662f $0$\uff0e\u725b\u5fb7\u6bd4\u4e9a\u7684\u9ad8\u901f\u4f1a\u8def\u6cd5\u89c4\u5b9a\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u4e0a\u884c\u9a76\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u65f6\u901f\u4e0d\u5f97\u4f4e\u4e8e$(1\\leq L\\leq 1,000,000)$\uff0e\u90a3\u4e48\uff0c\u8bf7\u4f60\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u5976\u725b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u4e0a\u884c\u9a76\u5462\uff1f\n",
