    "description": "\n\nBrenda enjoys a new role-playing game Buffcraft. Shields, swords, books and other carry-on items do not affects character stats in Buffcraft. The only way to increase the stats of your character is to buff her.\n\nThere are two types of buffs in Buffcraft. Direct buffs increase a base value of the stat, while percentage buffs increase stats by the fraction of the base value. To be precise, if unbuffed base value of your character stat is $b$ , you have buffed her using $n$ direct buffs of strength $d_1 , d_2 , \\cdots d_n$ and $m$ percentage buffs of strength $p_{1}, p_{2}, \\cdots , p_{m},$ the resulting stat will be equal to $(b + d_{1} + d_{2} + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + d_{n})(100 + p_{1} + p_{2} + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + p_{m})/100$ . Note that the resulting stat may be fractional.\n\nUnfortunately, your character has only $k$ buff slots and if you apply more than $k$ buffs on her, only the last $k$ buffs remains active. Thus, there is no reason to apply more than $k$ buffs simultaneously. You cannot apply the same buff more than once.\n\nBrenda is going to send his character to raid and wants to buff her health to maximal possible value. She has some direct and some percentage buffs at her disposal and needs your help to select the set of buffs that leads to maximal possible total health.\n\n",
