    "description": "Each of Farmer John's N (4 <= N <= 16) cows has a unique serial number S\\_i (1 <= S\\_i <= 25,000). The cows are so proud of it that each one now wears her number in a gangsta manner engraved in large letters on a gold plate hung around her ample bovine neck.\n\nGangsta cows are rebellious and line up to be milked in an order called 'Mixed Up'. A cow order is 'Mixed Up' if the sequence of serial numbers formed by their milking line is such that the serial numbers of every pair of consecutive cows in line differs by more than K (1 <= K <= 3400). For example, if N = 6 and K = 1 then 1, 3, 5, 2, 6, 4 is a 'Mixed Up' lineup but 1, 3, 6, 5, 2, 4 is not (since the consecutive numbers 5 and 6 differ by 1).\n\nHow many different ways can N cows be Mixed Up?\n\nFor your first 10 submissions, you will be provided with the results of running your program on a part of the actual test data.\n\nPOINTS: 200\n\n\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5bb6\u6709N\u5934\u5976\u725b\uff0c\u7b2ci\u5934\u5976\u725b\u7684\u7f16\u53f7\u662fSi\uff0c\u6bcf\u5934\u5976\u725b\u7684\u7f16\u53f7\u90fd\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5976\u725b\u6700\u8fd1 \u5728\u95f9\u813e\u6c14\uff0c\u4e3a\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0d\u6ee1\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\uff0c\u5979\u4eec\u5728\u6324\u5976\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u4e00\u5b9a\u8981\u6392\u6210\u6df7\u4e71\u7684\u961f\u4f0d\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u53ea\u6df7\u4e71\u7684\u961f \u4f0d\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u90bb\u5976\u725b\u7684\u7f16\u53f7\u4e4b\u5dee\u5747\u8d85\u8fc7K\u3002\u6bd4\u5982\u5f53K = 1\u65f6\uff0c1, 3, 5, 2, 6, 4\u5c31\u662f\u4e00\u652f\u6df7\u4e71\u7684\u961f\u4f0d\uff0c \u800c1, 3, 6, 5, 2, 4\u4e0d\u662f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a6\u548c5\u53ea\u5dee1\u3002\u8bf7\u6570\u4e00\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u79cd\u961f\u5f62\u662f\u6df7\u4e71\u7684\u5462\uff1f\n",
