    "description": "You are given a histogram consisting of N columns of heights $X_1,X_2,X_N$, respectively. The histogram needs to be transformed into a roof using a series of operations. A roof is a\nhistogram that has the following properties:\n- A single column is called the top of the roof. Let it be the column at position $i$.\n- The height of the column at position $j\\ (1 \u2264 j \u2264 N)$ is $ h_j = h_i- |i - j|$.\n- All heights $h_j$ are positive integers.\n\nAn operation can be increasing or decreasing the heights of a column of the histogram by $1$.\nIt is your task to determine the minimal number of operations needed in order to transform\nthe given histogram into a roof.\n",
    "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains the number $N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5$\n), the number of columns in the\nhistogram.\n\nThe following line contains $N$ numbers $X_i\\ (1 \u2264 X_i \u2264 10^9)$, the initial column heights.",
    "outputFormat": "You must output the minimal number of operations from the task.\n",

    "hint": "In test cases worth 60% of total points, it will hold N \u2264 5000.\n\n**Clarification of the first test case:** By increasing the height of the second, third, and fourth column,\nwe created a roof where the fourth column is the top of the roof.\n\n**Clarification of the second test case:** By decreasing the height of the third column three times, and\nincreasing the height of the fourth column, we transformed the histogram into a roof. The example is\nillustrated below.\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/pic/18666.png)"
